            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot, without ſome deſpondency of Mind, and awful fear of the Greatneſs of Your Majeſty, make an Offering at Your Sacred Feet of ſo ſmall an Eſteem and inconſiderable Value, as theſe following Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For having travelled long in remote Countries, and reſided no leſs than eighteen Years in <hi>Turky,</hi> the World may reaſonably expect ſome rich Returns unto Your Majeſty in Perſian Silks, and Tyrian Purples, or in the fineſt Carpets, and other Gayeties, in which the ſoftneſs and luxury of the Leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> did anciently abound: and may now judg me a Bankrupt, or ill Husband of my Talent, when they ſee me at Home trembling in Your Royal Preſence, with a Gift no more worthy than a few Sheets of Paper; which being a Sacrifice inferior and beneath the acceptance of ſo Great a Monarch, I might reaſonably fear, that they would take fire at the heat of Your juſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, were they not with all humility and reverence conſecrated to the Royal Clemency. For in this glorious Title and Attribute, Your Majeſty (as is notorious to the World) exceeding all the moſt Serene and moſt Clement Emperors that ever were, expects not from me, either Gold or Jewels, but rather a true Account of my Time, how I have ſpent it in the Service of God, and of your Majeſty: and how I have adminiſtred that Publick Truſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which was committed to my Management. Accept therefore, <hi>GREAT SIR,</hi> theſe following Diſcourſes, to diſcharge part of the Account of my Time, with other Treatiſes which have been the Employment to fill up my vacant Intervals: the remaining account of my Hours are not to be juſtified by my own Report, but by the Teſtimony of others, whoſe Wiſdom and Goodneſs will be as ready to own my Induſtry and Faithfulneſs in their Concernments, as they will be to excuſe and pardon my Infirmities.</p>
            <p>Ever ſince the time of Your Majeſty's happy Reſtauration, my Lot hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to live and act within the Dominions of the Turk, and there to move in a Publick Capacity; which though it was in an Adminiſtration of one of the loweſt Note and Degree, yet the great Influence which the flouriſhing Eſtate of that Trade hath on the common Good of <hi>England,</hi> nouriſhed in me a ſecret Pride and Satisfaction in that Employment, which called and raiſed up all my Endeavours to acquit my ſelf therein with Prudence, Faithfulneſs, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; there being the ſame Regularity required in the Stars of the lower, as in thoſe of higher Magnitude.</p>
            <p>This hath been the firſt, and indeed the only Affair I ever managed for the Publick: for before Your Majeſty's bleſſed Return, the Character noted on my Family of being Loyal, as it made them at firſt active and zealous in the Service of Your Glorious Father, ſo afterwards it famed them for their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rendred them and me uncapable of Office. But Your Majeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning like the Sun, to animate and cheriſh all living Creatures, with an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity proportioned to their ſeveral Capacities, hath been pleaſed alſo to beſtow a Ray of Your benign Influence on my ſelf; whereby having received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Refreſhment, I do with all ſenſe of my Duty, and with entire Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pray unto the King of Kings for the Happineſs, long Life, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Glory of Your Majeſty, and with all reverence and humble ſubmiſſion, devote and conſecrate my ſelf, for ever to remain,</p>

                  <head>THE REIGN OF Sultan MORAT, OR AMURAT IV. The Eleventh EMPEROR; AND Twenty firſt MONARCH OF THE TURKS.</head>
                  <p>THE weak Underſtanding of Sultan <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and his inability for Rule, cauſed the Affairs of State, both at Home and Abroad, to move diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and irregular. <hi>Where Violence and Injuſtice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, there is ſo little diſtance between the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Height of Grandure, and the loweſt Abyſs of Miſery, that a Prince may in a moment ſtep from one unto the other.</hi> The Janiſaries and Military Officers commanded more now than the Civil, all things being guided by the Air and Fancy of the Souldiery, who placed and diſplaced with that wind of Favour and Diſpleaſure, which is agreeable to the Humour of a Multitude, and the Licentiouſneſs of Arms. For at the ſame time there were three Emperors, ſeven Great Viziers, two Captain-Paſha's, five Aga's of the Janiſaries, three Treaſurers, ſix Paſha's of <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro;</hi> and in proportion, the Changes and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were as many in all the Provinces of the Empire. All this Confuſion evidently proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the weak and almoſt ſenſleſs Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> the Miniſters and People concurred, as it were, in an univerſal Conſent to dethrone him a ſecond time, and exalt into his Place Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> Brother to <hi>Oſman,</hi> who was murdered the Year before. The Principal Actors in this Contrivance, were <hi>Kioſem</hi> the Mother of <hi>Morat,</hi> and the Mufti. But in the execution hereof, three Difficulties occurred: The firſt was <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha the Great Vizier; who by reaſon of the Inabilities of <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> being become abſolute Lord and Soveraign of all, would be unwilling to aſſent unto that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which might degrade him of his Dignity, and diveſt him of his Power. A ſecond Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle was the Fancy and Humour of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, who having with much Zeal and Paſſion exalted <hi>Muſtapha</hi> to the Throne, it might be doubted, that in maintenance of the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, they would with equal obſtinacy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their Election. A third was the Poverty or low Ebb of the Exchequer, which at that time was in no capacity to ſupply that Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Souldiery, which was uſual and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary at the Inauguration of every Sultan. To forward and haſten this Change, and ripen this Plot, the News of the Rebellion of <hi>Abaſſa</hi> did much contribute; who with a Body of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Horſe, roved over all the Plains of <hi>Kara-hiſar,</hi> calling himſelf Avenger of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Oſman</hi>'s Murder, and Enemy of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries; by whoſe Mutiny and Conſpiracy he was put to Death: in ſatisfaction for which, he not only killed all Janiſaries which fell into his hands; but their Wives, Children, and thoſe allied to them, he deſtroyed with implacable Malice and bloody Rage. Upon this Advice, the Janiſaries at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being moved with equal Fury and deſire of Revenge, applied themſelves to their Aga, propoſing a ſpeedy Union with the Spahees, for ſuppreſſing this Rebellion before Time gave it greater growth, and made the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour more ſtubborn and difficult to be purged. At the ſame time alſo came Letters from <hi>Cicala</hi> Paſha, (who was diſpatched into <hi>Aſia</hi> with a ſtrong Party, to give a ſtop to the farther Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Advance of <hi>Abaſſa</hi>) adviſing that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his near approach to the Enemy, ſo general a Fear poſſeſſed his Souldiery, that moſt of them

At which Reply the Janiſaries becoming more unquiet, aſſembled themſelves in a tumultuous manner at the Moſch of Sultan <hi>Solyman;</hi> where making an<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ayack</hi> in Turkiſh ſignifies a Foot.</note> Ayack Divan, (ſo called, becauſe they ſit not down, but ſtand on their Legs, to denote the preſent haſte and urgency of their Affair) it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, by an unanimous conſent of the Civil and Military Power, That young <hi>Morat,</hi> or <hi>Amurat,</hi> ſhould be promoted to the Throne, and that <hi>Muſtapha</hi> ſhould be depoſed: And becauſe the Exchequer was at its loweſt Ebb, and wholly exhauſted by miſcarriage of the Officers, the Souldiers were contented to diſpenſe with their Donative; which they relinquiſhed in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Publick Good, reſerving ſtill their Title and Claim thereunto at times of a more happy Inauguration. With this News the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier immediately mounted on Horſe-back to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify this Univerſal Decree to <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> but he found him ſo ſtupid, as if he had been inſenſible of the Meſſage; and his Mother wanting Power to reſiſt this ſtrong Convulſion, gave way to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and ſeemed to embrace what ſhe could not oppoſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Muſtapha</hi> falling from the Heaven of his Throne to the Abyſs of his Priſon, ſeemed to return unto his Centre; for being only by the Wild-fire of Fortune carried as far aloft, as the force of popular Powder could reach, he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the meer weight of his earthly Temper returned with the like quickneſs of Motion to the place from whence he aſcended.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon Sultan <hi>Amurat,</hi> a Youth of about fourteen years of Age, was brought forth to the People, and placed in the Throne with all the Acclamations and Rejoycings of the People. And being taught by his Mother in a feigned man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to refuſe acceptance of the Empire, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Exchequer was exhauſted, and that therefore he was not able to demonſtrate the Affection and Eſteem he had for them; and that ſince they had killed their former Sultans, he was fearful leſt the tenderneſs of his Age ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him to the like Violence: but the Souldiery having not the patience to hearken to his Excuſes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amurat</hi> inſtalled.</note> immediately carried him to the Divan, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cloathed him in White, they ſeated him on a Safraw, erected with four Pillars, ſtudded with precious Stones; the Covering of which was of Crimſon-Velvet, richly embroidered with Gold and Oriental-Pearl. And being ſo ſeated, the Mufti with all reverence approached, and kiſſed his Hand; and then turning to the People, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them, If they were contented with that Prince whom they now beheld in the Seat of the Ottoman Kings? To which they having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven aſſent by their loud Acclamations; <hi>Morat,</hi> with a becoming gravity, encharged the Mufti to take care that Juſtice and the Law be executed, and ſo retired to his Lodgings with general ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. The next morning he was carried by Water to the Moſch of <hi>Jub</hi> in the Suburbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where according to the Solemnity of the Ottoman Empire, having performed his<note n="*" place="margin">Which is a diſpenſing of Mutton to the Poor.</note> 
                     <hi>Corban,</hi> or Sacrifice, and having his Cemiter grit to his Side by the Emirſheriff, he mounted on Horſe-back, and with a magnificent Train en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Gate of <hi>Adrianople.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who was more worthy to bear a Fool's Cap than an Imperial Diadem, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to Priſon, and more narrowly guarded than formerly; howſoever no Man offered to take away his Life, the Perſons of Fools and Idiots being ſacred in eſteem of the Turks, and the leaſt Injury offered to them accounted Irreligious and Unlucky.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morat</hi> was of a lively Countenance, full-fac'd, dark Hair, of a black and lively Eye, ruddy and ſanguine Complexion, and in every degree of a promiſing and hopeful Aſpect: but his exteriour appearance did not correſpond with the internal Cruelty of his violent Spirit, having ſome ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with the Swan, which hath white Feathers and black Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The Great Vizier who aſſiſted at this Solemnity, was (as we have ſaid) <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, a Perſon of Self-intereſt, who had waſted and conſumed the Treaſury, and converted a great part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to his own Benefit; he was a Tyrant, hated of all Men, and ſupported himſelf by no other Art than bribing of the Souldiery: And to his other Crimes he added, that of having unjuſtly perſecuted <hi>Halil</hi> Paſha, and deprived him of his Office, his Power not reaching to the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Life; which being reſerved for better Times, he was again recalled from his Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by ſpecial Command of the Sultan, was unwillingly reſtored to the Office of Vizier, being beſt pleaſed with a quiet and pacifick Life, to which his melancholy Temper had naturally diſpoſed him. In the mean time <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha being terrified by the ſenſible touches of his own Conſcience, took his flight by way of the Black Sea; and being out of the reach of Juſtice, a Fine was ſet of Five thouſand Zechins, and of Lands to the Revenue of an hundred thouſand Aſpers a Year, to be given unto him who ſhould bring his Head. Many of thoſe who had ſold him their Friendſhip and Favour, being affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Sentence, voluntarily diſgorged the Rewards they had received; and amongſt the reſt, the laſt Aga of the Janiſaries, who had been his Kahya or Steward for the ſpace of three months, reſtored 8 hundred thouſand Dollars as an Atonement for his Sin, and a Ranſom for pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing his own Life and Office. At length, by force of the foregoing Reward, <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha was betrayed and taken alive; and being brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was immediately ſtrangled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Gate of the Divan.</p>
                  <p>Many were the Difficulties which this young Sultan was to encounter; the greateſt of which was the Inſolence of the Janiſaries, who feeling themſelves empty of Mony, began to repent of the prodigal and eaſy remiſſion of their Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and in a tumultuous manner to redemand it again. There was no Argument or Debate to be uſed againſt Men of the Sword, who hearkned to no other Reaſon than their own Wants, and to ſatisfy them, there was no other Remedy than Compliance; wherefore all Officers and Perſons not employed in Military Affairs were forced to contribute towards a large Tax, and a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Demand was made for the Loan of Thirty thouſand Zechins from the four Chriſtian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors reſident at the Port, that they alſo as Friends might yield an aſſiſting hand towards the preſent Urgency of Affairs: ſo little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:39539:4"/>and ſhame have Turks to lay open the Nakedneſs and diſtreſs of their Country even to Strangers and Enemies of it. And indeed ſuch was the Inſolence and uncontroulable Power of the Souldiery, that their Deſires and Commands were Laws, and their Determinations Rules for their Sultan and his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>This Humour of Uſurpation and unlimited Power, wearied all the Officers of the Empire, and inclined them ſecretly to approve the Cauſe of <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Paſha of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> who declared and ſtiled himſelf Enemy to the Janiſaries; and of <hi>Bechir</hi> Paſha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who was joined with him. The Vizier alſo finding his Power abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Arbitrary Will of the Souldiery, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſlowly and coldly into <hi>Aſia,</hi> where all the Force he could make, conſiſted of no more than fifty thouſand new and unexperienced Men, ſuch as were uncapable to contend with a more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army of veterane Souldiers; to which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia</hi> joined himſelf, as did all other the chief Timar-Spahees, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together to confound and deſtroy the Pride and Government of the Janiſaries. The Vizier alſo was of the ſame Party, and coldly at firſt anſwered the Requeſt of the Janiſaries, when they earneſtly preſſed him to lead them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Abaſſa</hi> their common and mortal Enemy: At length, being fortified with the Force of the Timar-Spahees, he told them plainly, That if they would go and fight, he would be a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Succeſs, but would not engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Quarrel wherein the Blood of <hi>Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> might be ſpilt on one ſide and the other: by which means the Rebels in <hi>Aſia</hi> took Head, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in Force, and every day rendred them in a more formidable and dangerous poſture.</p>
                  <p>But this was not all the Trouble which enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for the Tartars having refuſed that King whom the Grand Signior had appointed them to receive, declared for <hi>Mehmet</hi> his Brother: who was ſeconded by the Votes of the Generality, and maintained by the ſtrongeſt Nerve of that Nation. The Vizier was unwilling to ingage in this Quarrel, alledging, That a Civil War was the worſt of Evils, and that it was better to connive at a preſent Inconvenience, than in this diſtracted Time of Affairs, to pollute the Empire with the Blood of Tartars, who were their Brethren, and of the ſame Religion and Alliance with them. Howſoever the Divan was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Opinion, and reſolved to diſpeed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha with a Force ſufficient to re-inſtate <hi>Gherey</hi> (for ſo the Elder Brother was called) in the Government of that Kingdom. But yet the Inſtructions given, rather directed him to act with Dexterity than with Force, ſuppoſing that the Authority of the Turks abetted with the preſence of a conſiderable Force, would create an inclination in the Tartars to Obedience, ſo ſoon as they diſcovered them to appear on their Coaſt. The Captain-Paſha being arrived at<note n="*" place="margin">The chief City of the <hi>Krim</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</note> 
                     <hi>Caffá,</hi> declared, That he was ſent by the Grand Signior, not to exclude either one or other of the Pretenders, but only to be Witneſs of a free and fair Election; that ſo all Civil Diſcord ceaſing, that Party might be choſen who was moſt pleaſing to the generality of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. To which end two Standards were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, one for<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gherey</hi> the Name of the Family.</note> 
                     <hi>Gherey</hi> the Elder Brother deſired by the Turks, and the other for <hi>Mehmet</hi> beloved of the Tartars. The People in multitudes ran to the Standard of <hi>Mehmet,</hi> and but few to that of <hi>Gherey;</hi> which demonſtrated at how mean a rate the Tartars eſteemed the Protection and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Port. The Captain-Paſha vexed hereat, denied to give his Aſſent to the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on pretence, that he was firſt to demand the Grand Signior's Pleaſure; but at length was perſwaded by <hi>Gherey</hi> to land a Force of about eight thouſand Men to own and maintain his Cauſe, on hopes, that rather than ingage againſt the Turks, the People would condeſcend to Terms in his Admiſſion and Favour. The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars not being in the leaſt diſmayed hereat, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed themſelves in a warlike Poſture, and feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fear and Flight, allured the Turks to a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of them, until they had brought them to a place where thirty thouſand Horſe lay in ambuſh; which on a ſudden ariſing and encompaſſing them round, had entirely deſtroyed them, had not <hi>Salil</hi> the Brother of <hi>Mehmet</hi> given a ſtop to the ſlaughter, on hopes, that ſuch a teſtimony of Friendſhip would reconcile the Spirits of the Turks, at leaſt might render his Brother's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment more tolerable and grateful to the Turks. In this conflict, <hi>Ibrahim</hi> and <hi>Chuſaein</hi> who were Viziers of the Bench, the kahya and a Capigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhe of the Seraglio were ſlain, whoſe Bodies were afterwards tranſported to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſix hundred Janiſaries and as many Sea-men were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and fifteen hundred Priſoners were taken, whoſe Liberty was procured at a mean Ranſom, for the ſake of that Faith and Religion which they jointly profeſſed; they alſo took thirty Pieces of Cannon, and might alſo have become Maſters of the whole Fleet conſiſting of thirty ſix Gallies, had they been deſirous to have proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted their Victory to the utmoſt advantage: and moreover in that conjuncture of Affairs, when a general conſternation had overſpread the principal parts of the Ottoman Dominions, when the Councils were feeble and faint, and that a languiſhing Pulſe beat in all the Government, had the Tartar with an Army of fifty thouſand Horſe then ready to march, made up to the Walls of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> it might have proved ſuch an opportunity for dividing and deſtroying this Empire, as hath not offered at any time ſince that Occaſion. But the two Brothers, <hi>Mehmet</hi> and <hi>Salil,</hi> ſtiling their War forced and defenſive, uſed that moderation in their Victory, which might not provoke a deſire of Revenge in the Turks. The Captain-Paſha being thus permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to depart from <hi>Caffa</hi> with his Fleet, ſailed to <hi>Varna,</hi> a Port in the Black Sea, about two hundred miles diſtant from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where the News of this Defeat being arrived, put all the City into confuſion, and raiſed the Viziers at midnight to conſult of thoſe Remedies and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients which were agreeable to the preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency of Affairs. The Great Vizier <hi>Ali</hi> was of opinion, that the Grand Signor ought to condeſcend to Terms of Accommodation, tho to the diſadvantage and diſreputation of his Power; and that accordingly a Letter ſhould be wrote to <hi>Mehmet</hi> the Tartar, beginning with the uſual Complements of Friendſhip and Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and afterwards declaring, That it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the intention of the Port to ingage in a War againſt him, the late conflict having only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a miſtake and miſinterpretation of Orders; and that there was no other deſign, than to compoſe the Civil Differences amongſt themſelves, by advancing that Prince to the Kingly Dignity who was moſt pleaſing and grateful to the People. This Advice was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the reſt of the Council, and a Meſſenger diſpatched with the Letter, accompanied with a Cemiter and Veſt of Sables, which are the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the Sultan's Favour. In the mean time the People murmured at the puſillanimity of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39539:5"/>Government, ſaying, That they had ſent an Ambaſſador to thank the Tartar for not ſeizing their whole Fleet, and acknowledg their Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him for the Blows and Wounds he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Army. The Tartars alſo gloried in this ſubmiſſion, and took the boldneſs to vaunt of their Linage and Deſcent to be more Ancient and Noble than that of the Ottoman Family; and that in this time of decay and degenerate proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of that Monarchy, it appertained to the Greatneſs of the Tartars to ſtir up the Fire and ſnuff the Lamp, that the Splendor of that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire might become more bright and ſhining than in former Ages. And ſo little reſpect did they now maintain for the Port, that they ſurpriſed two Ambaſſadors ſent from the Moſcovite in their way to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> robbed and killed them, as alſo the Turkiſh Chiaus that was with them, leſt his Teſtimony ſhould be brought in for an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Troubles, the Coſſacks taking advantage of the Captain-Paſha's abſence in <hi>Tartary,</hi> entered the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> with about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and fitty Sail of Saicks and Boats;<note place="margin">The form of the Coſſacks Boats.</note> theſe Boats and Veſſels which the Coſſacks uſe, are built long and light, with ten Oars of a ſide, and two Men to an Oar; the Head and Stern are not unlike, ſo that they hang the Rudder ſometimes at one end, and ſometimes at the other, being not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to turn their Veſſel, but without loſs of time to proceed with that end which happens to be foremoſt. Each Boat carries fifty ſelect Men armed with Fire-arms and Cemiter, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of which they are very expert; and are a People ſober, enduring Labour and hard Diet; and ſo ſpeedy in their Incurſions, that they foreſtal the Advices, and commonly ſtrike be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they threaten. With theſe Boats and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (as we have ſaid) they entred the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> where they burnt ſeveral Villages and Houſes of Pleaſure; on the Grecian ſide they burnt <hi>Boyuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri</hi> and <hi>Yenichioi,</hi> on the Aſian ſide <hi>Stenia.</hi> The appearance of this Enemy ſo near the Imperial City, cauſed a general Conſternation, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that at <hi>London,</hi> when the Dutch entred the River of <hi>Chatham.</hi> To oppoſe this Force, there was not one Gally in readineſs, ſo that Saicks, Chimbers, and ſmall Boats were armed, to the number of four or five hundred, and man'd with ſuch people as the preſent haſte and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on offered; the great Chain was then brought forth to croſs the <hi>BOſphorus,</hi> which the Grecian Emperors uſed at the Seige of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> and Ten thouſand Men were iſſued from the City to defend the Shoar from depredation and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſchief. The Turkiſh Fleet faced the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks to give them a ſtop, whilſt they hovered about the middle of the Chanel in form of a Half-Moon, and ſo continued the whole day until Sun-ſet; when with the night they returned into the Sea, carrying with them, beſides their Booty, Glory ſufficient to have entred the Chanel, and without blows or oppoſition, to have braved the Capital Seat of the Ottoman Monarchy, and the moſt formidable City of the whole Word. Not many days after they returned again with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Force than before, which put the City into the like conſternation; and having hovered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four days at the Mouth of the Black Sea, they burnt the Pharos or Lantern with certain Villages thereabouts, and being laden with Spoils and Glory, they again returned into their own Country. Thus we may obſerve, how bold Enemies are made with the weakneſs of a State: a Horſe is ſoon ſenſible of his Rider, when backed by a faint Hand, and an unaccuſtomed Lightneſs, but a ſtiff Rein and a cloſe Knee makes him obedient to his Ruler. All people having diſcovered the imbecillity of the Government, made head againſt it: and the young Sultan had thoſe for his Enemies in the time of his Nonage, which in his ſtrong and fiercer years became the moſt ſubmiſſive and Fawning Slaves in the World.</p>
                  <p>And though at this time the Turkiſh Miniſters were corrupt and rebellious, and the Souldiery mutinous; yet <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

Thus we ſee, that whilſt the Turks themſelves endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to rent in pieces their own Monarchy, to which one would have thought, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had moſt reaſon to contribute; yet ſuch was the unhappy Fate of Chriſtendom, that <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> was the only Perſon at that time to court the Turks; and that for no other Reaſon, than that he might be ſupported and abetted in a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor and other Chriſtian Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Army of <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> conſiſted of above Thirty thouſand Men, with which he marched over all <hi>Hungary,</hi> having taken moſt Towns of conſideration, unleſs <hi>Presburg,</hi> alias <hi>Poſſonium, Rab,</hi> and <hi>Komorra.</hi> But if we penetrate into the depth and foundation of this War, we ſhall find that it had a deeper Intereſt than that of <hi>Gabor,</hi> and had its Original from the Diſcord and Civil War of <hi>Germany.</hi> For the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time in a condition to render it ſelf formidable, and in a poſture to create a jealouſy in all the Princes ſubjected to it, did under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of ſubduing the Palatine of the <hi>Rhyne,</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alſo the Liberty of the Empire, and of the ſeveral States which compoſed it. For after the Emperor, againſt the Conſtitutions of the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Seal, and the Senſe of the Electoral Colledg, had diveſted the Palatine and his Children of their Eſtates and Dignity, not ſo much by Force of Arms, as by Deceit and Breach of Promiſe; inſtead of disbanding the Army, which was to have been performed according to Agreement, new Troops were added; and though the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant League was diſſolved, yet the Catholick Combination, with all its Adherents, remained armed and immoveable to compel the Proteſtants to a reſtitution of the Eccleſiaſtical Revenue, notwithſtanding the Articles of Peace to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: ſo that the Princes and Towns of the Lower <hi>Saxony</hi> entring into a new League, raiſed an Army under the Command of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alberſtadt.

                  <list>
                     <item>1. That on both parts Arms be laid down for ten months, and all Acts of Hoſtility ceaſe; that on neither ſide any attempt ſhould be made ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force or fraud to take any Caſtles, Forts, Cities, or places of Defence during this time; and that both Germans, Hungarians, and Turks ſhould be alike comprehended.</item>
                     <item>2. That if the Emperor were deſirous to treat and conclude a final Peace with the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, he ſhould uſe <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> as Mediator, and do nothing therein without his privity.</item>
                     <item>3. That all Places and Forts taken by the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> in his late Expedition, and that all Cities and Caſtles now in poſſeſſion of either, ſhould ſo remain without any alteration.</item>
                     <item>4. That all Paſſages ſhould be open for free Trade of Merchants, and all other the Subjects and Friends of either ſide.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>A Truce being thus concluded, the Turks in their return made great havock, carrying with them great numbers of poor Chriſtians into Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, which <hi>Gabor</hi> out of compaſſion ſeemed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to redeem with a low price at his own charge; which the Turks refuſing, carried thoſe miſerable Wretches into Captivity.

The next day but one after he charged another Party of them, as they attempted to paſs a Bridg, which the night before he had cauſed to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down; of which having killed a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the reſt ſaved themſelves by ſwimming: howſoever many Chriſtians procured their liberty thereby, and a conſiderable Booty was made of Horſes, Camels, Waggons, and all Proviſions. The other Troops conſiſting of greater numbers, were worſe treated than the former; for <hi>Eſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſi</hi> having received a Recruit of Horſe from <hi>Reiffemberg</hi> Governor of <hi>Komorra,</hi> and <hi>Breuner</hi> of <hi>Jarvarin</hi> or <hi>Rab,</hi> he proceeded boldly to meet the Turks, and joyning Battel with them, he ſlew twelve hundred on the place, gave liberty to fourteen hundred Chriſtians, took divers of their principal Commanders, with all their Bag and Baggage, beſides a conſiderable quantity of Gold and Silver, in Plate and Mony. Nor were <hi>Reif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>femberg</hi> and <hi>Breuner</hi> leſs ſucceſsful over thoſe who paſſed through their Quarters to joyn with the Gariſons of <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> and <hi>Caniſia,</hi> having killed ſeven hundred of them, and taken all their Baggage. Moreover Count <hi>Serini</hi> in his Jouney towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> defeated ſix hundred of them, and preſented their Colours to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: and <hi>Eſterhaſi</hi> in like manner after his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Exploits, offered thirty Cornets at his Feet, with ſix Priſoners of Quality, one o f which was Kinſ man of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Rebuffs cooled the courage of the Turks a little, and altered the reſolution of the Council for carrying forward the War on the ſide of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> as was intended, had the Succeſs anſwered expectation: For theſe Misfortunes abroad, and inteſtine Troubles at home, with Peſtilence and Famine, which at the ſame time greatly afflicted the parts of <hi>Conſtatinople</hi> (whereby an hundred thouſand People died) abated the Mettle of the Turks, and cauſed them to take new Meaſures in all their Determinations: and for that reaſon Ambaſſadors were ſent both to <hi>Vienna</hi> and into <hi>Poland</hi> to renew the Articles of Peace, and ſo to confirm the League, that whilſt the Sultan was imployed in his Wars with <hi>Perſia</hi> and the Eaſtern Countries, nothing ſhould intervene from the Weſtern Parts to trouble or obſtruct his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or recal him from his Enterpriſe. For now the Rebellion of <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> joined with <hi>Bechir</hi> Paſha of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> growing daily more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and his ſtrength increaſing to that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he was able to keep the Field in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the Grand Signiors Forces, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to quarter within five days March of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople:</hi> and at the ſame time Letters coming from <hi>Hafiſh</hi> Paſha General of the Army in the Province of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> was entred into the Dominions of the Turk with a powerful Army, a general Conſternation ſeized the whole Turkiſh Court, the wiſeſt and ſtouteſt having occaſion to call up for all their Wiſdom and Courage to aſſiſt at a Time when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was aſſailed on all ſides, both at home and abroad. Various were the Counſels and Propoſals in what manner to proceed in Times of ſuch emergency. Firſt it was reſolved to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a War both againſt the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Rebels in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and that whoſoever took of the Grand Signior Pay, from one Aſper a day to higher value, ſhould be in readineſs to ſerve in the War, upon penalty of loſing his Eſtate, of being accounted a Rebel, and his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſold for Slaves. But the more ſober and moderate ſort judged it policy to take off <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſa,</hi> by ſending him a general Pardon, with a conceſſion of all his Demands, upon condition, that he ſhould turn his Arms upon the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> who was the common Enemy of their Country and Religion: but the Janiſaries would by no means aſſent to this Agreement, with a Perſon to whom they bore a more inveterate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, than to the Perſian himſelf, as he did alſo to the Janiſaries. For that he might better juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his pretence of Revenge, he declared, That being one day in a Moſch at his Prayers, the murdered <hi>Oſman</hi> appeared to him, and taking him by the hand, ſaid, My faithful <hi>Muſſulman,</hi> ſince thou art the moſt generous of all my Slaves, I command thee to revenge my Death, with the Blood of ſixty thouſand Janiſaries and Spahees; good Forture ſhall accompany thy Arms, and Victory ſhall crown thy Labours. During theſe Intrigues and Difficulties of Reconciliation, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſa,</hi> ſpoiled the Leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Perſian King conquered the City and Province of <hi>Bagdan,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> took <hi>Kur Aſan</hi> Paſha, an old Souldier, Priſoner, poſſeſſed himſelf of <hi>Moſul</hi> and <hi>Leska</hi> on the Perſian Sea; and meeting no conſiderable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, he divided his Army into four parts. The firſt was diſpatched into <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the King himſelf. The ſecond made Incurſions into <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> The third infeſted the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39539:6"/>Coaſt of the Black Sea: and the fourth marched towards <hi>Mecha,</hi> with hope and deſign of ſharing all the parts of the Eaſtern Empire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, who oppoſed the King in <hi>Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia,</hi> was ſlain, and his Army wholly defeated, ſo that the Province became a Prey to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: the ſucceſs in <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was equally fortunate by the revolt of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> a place of great Riches and Importance; the Coaſt of the Black Sea was greviouſly infeſted, and a Port taken near to <hi>Trapezond;</hi> and little oppoſition being made at <hi>Balſora,</hi> the Town was taken by that Army in their March towards <hi>Mecha</hi> and the parts of the Red Sea, where they rendered themſelves Maſters of <hi>Medina,</hi> the City of their Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To repair theſe loſſes, and to encounter num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo ſtrong and valiant in all parts, the Vizier was diſpeeded with a powerful FOrce to the Town of <hi>Bagdat;</hi> but by reaſon of Mutinies and Tumults amongſt the Souldiery, Matters found not the ſucceſs expected: and the Gariſon mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valiant and vigorous Sallies againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becility of the Turkiſh Souldiery, which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt obſtinate and ſtout to oppoſe their own Commanders, obtained an advantage in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Attempt; by which diſcouragement many forſaking their Colours,<note place="margin">The Siege raiſed at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> &amp; the Turks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown.</note> the Siege was raiſed with diſhonour, and the Intereſt of the Turk impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and almoſt irreparably loſt in thoſe Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. This News arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the Camp was riſen and fled by Night, that they were forced to burn their Tents and Proviſions, and to break their great Artillery and caſt them into the <hi>Euphrates:</hi> that the Miſeries in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had been ſuch by Famine and Peſtilence, and want of all Proviſions and Ammunition, that the like was never known: that the Vizier had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed three of his Paſha's, that ſo he might caſt the whole blame upon them; and that now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating with his Army into the Turkiſh Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Perſians purſued them in the Rear, and for ten days did execution on them making the beſt uſe they could of their Victory; which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation filled the Hearts of all People with ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſordered the Counſels with confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Cauſe of which will Succeſs, according to cuſtom, being imputed to the General, he was deprived of his Office, and ſacrificed to the Fury of the Janiſaries.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Troubles were increaſed at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by the Addreſſes which the Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> made unto the Port by his Kapi-Kahya or Agent, repreſenting to the Grand Signior, That he wanting Heirs Male to ſucceed him in his Principality; the States at a Diet had, with common conſent, elected his Lady for his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; and therefore deſired confirmation from the Port. In excuſe of her Sex, he alledged the urgent Neceſſity of the preſent Times, which perſwaded rather to admit of the Government of a Woman, than that his Principality ſhould, for want of an Heir, fall into the Hands of the powerful Family of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> To make good this Demand, Duke <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Weymar,</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> and Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> join with the Prince of <hi>Tranſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</hi>
                     </note> arrived in <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> to whom the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> joined his Troops: and <hi>Morteza</hi> Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> wrote to the Port, that he was marching towards <hi>Vatz</hi> to meet the Prince, and confer with him concerning theſe Deſigns. The Emperor's Reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed againſt theſe Proceedings; which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing troubled the Counſels of the Turks, who in that Conjuncture were unwilling to give be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings to a new War; ſo that beſides fair Words, they promiſed to write ſuch Letters to the Paſha of <hi>Buda,</hi> as ſhould give a ſtop to the Inveſtiture of the Princes. But, to ſay truly, the Inſtructions given were in ſuch ambiguous terms, that they in effect left the whole Matter to the Diſcretion of <hi>Morteza</hi> to act, as he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt agreeable to the State of Affairs on the Frontiers, and ſecurity of the preſent Peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the Turkiſh Court ſeek to ward off the blow of a War with <hi>Germany,</hi> and yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly nouriſhed and encouraged it, by giving Orders to the Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> to take up his Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-quarters with the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and to follow his Directions; but yet ſo to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern Matters with Caution, as not to engage too far on uncertain Grounds or doubtful Hazard, but to embrace Propoſitions of Peace, if offered with Honour and Security. In proſecution of theſe Rules, <hi>Morteza</hi> obſerving, that <hi>Weymar</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> having united their Forces with <hi>Gabor,</hi> had formed a conſiderable Army, and were able to fight with <hi>Walleſtein</hi> General of the Imperialiſts; joined alſo his Forces to theirs, judging it a prudent and politick Deſign to wage a War at the Blood and Expence of others. With theſe Encouragements, and with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a good Opportunity,<note place="margin">The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Army defeated.</note> the Confederates fell upon the Army of <hi>Walleſtein</hi> near the River <hi>Gran;</hi> who not being able to withſtand their Force and Fury, was put to flight, and purſued in the Rear with great ſlaughter; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to paſs the River on two Bridges of Boats, were cloſely followed by the Prince's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who gaining the Paſs, put the whole Army into great amazement, and reſolved to purſue them to the Gates of <hi>Presburg,</hi> or <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this Succeſs, the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> obſerving the backwardneſs of his Allies to contribute the Succours of Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which they had promiſed; and fearing that the unfortunate Eſtate of the Turkiſh Affairs ſhould cauſe the Sultan to diſown the War, diſpeeded a Meſſenger to the Emperor in the Winter-ſeaſon, to excuſe the Conſtraint upon him of taking up Arms, and to offer Terms of Accommodation and Peace. But the Emperor refuſed all Treaties, until ſuch time as <hi>Gabor</hi> had ſeparated himſelf from his Allies, and from aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation with the Turk: Upon which Anſwer, <hi>Gabor</hi> retired to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> and <hi>Morteza</hi> to <hi>Peſth.</hi> This Compliance gave beginning to a Treaty at <hi>Komara,</hi> where the Commiſſioners on part of the Emperor, of the Grand Signior, and Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> aſſembled. All Parties ſeemed inclinable to War, and yet with occult Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to make Peace, being neceſſitated thereunto by the urgency of their diſtinct Intereſts. The Emperor was urged by his Wars with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Germany,</hi> and apprehenſion of Forces from <hi>England</hi> in favour of the Elector Palatine, then King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> The Grand Signior was encumbred by the unfortunate condition of his Wars in <hi>Aſia:</hi> And <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> jealous of being diſowned by the Port, deſerted by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and expoſed to fight and contend ſingly with the Emperor. In ſhort, <hi>Gabor</hi> concluded a Peace with the Emperor apart,<note place="margin">Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperor and <hi>Gabor.</hi>
                     </note> which gave ſome Jealouſies and diſpleaſure to the Grand Signior: Howſoever he diſſembled his Diſcontent, and willingly intereſſed <hi>Gabor</hi> with <hi>Morteza</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner for him; who being variouſly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yet moved with the conſiderations of their common Advantage, work'd all Differences into a Compoſition of Peace; the Articles of which being brought to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by an Internuncio from the Emperor, and delivered in preſence of the two Ambaſſadors of <hi>Gabor,</hi> they were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39539:6"/>accepted by the Chimacam, and ratified by the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>Articles of Peace concluded between the Emperor of <hi>Germany Ferdinand</hi> the Second, and <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> in the Month of <hi>December</hi> 1626.</p>

                  <p>By theſe Articles we may obſerve, that both Parties were deſirous of a preſent Peace, rather than one which was durable; for things are ſo ſlubber'd over to ſerve the preſent Occaſion, that they leave all Diſputes undecided, till Time ſhould happen more proper to interpret them with the Sword, than with the Pen: like Sores ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by an unskilful Chirurgion, which feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring within, muſt be again opened before they are cured: howſoever they ſerved the turn of <hi>Gabor,</hi> whoſe Intereſt it was to maintain an ill Correſpondence between the two Emperors.</p>
                  <p>Peace being thus concluded between <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Second and Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> gave ſome reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Affairs of the Turks: ſo that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the late ſucceſs of the Perſian in their War, by raiſing the Siege of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and overthrow of the Turkiſh Army; yet that King finding himſelf now engaged alone, and ſingly to contend with the Ottoman Power, feared the Puiſſance of that Empire, leſt being rouſed and heated with the ſenſible Pinches of the late Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, they ſhould call up and invigorate all their Forces to a Revenge, which might at length tend to a ruin and deſtruction of <hi>Perſia,</hi> unleſs For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which attended the firſt auſpicious begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings with Succeſs, did alſo continue conſtant, and ſtill accompany their Arms, which could hardly be expected.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore on theſe Conſiderations becoming more faint in proſecution of the War, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian diſpatched an Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> furniſhed with various Propoſals and Projects for a Peace; but ſtill Mattters driving ſo as to reſerve the City and Province of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the hands of the Perſian, the Treaty became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, in regard the Vizier (who was then called <hi>Halil</hi> Paſha) judged it a high and an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable diſreputation to the Empire, to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of ſo principal a part of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ambaſſador being diſpatched away with ſome neglect, the Turks armed with that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and heat, that they entred <hi>Perſia</hi> with an Army of an hundred and fifty thouſand Men; with which appearance the people being diſmay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuffered <hi>Tauris</hi> to be taken without much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. From hence marching to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39539:7"/>found the City well provided and defended with a numerous Gariſon, from whence many Sallies were made with variety of Fortune, till at length the Turkiſh Souldiers being wearied and tired with inceſſant labour and watchings, many of them fled from their Colours: and with ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutions, the Army being much abated in its Numbers, the Vizier withdrew them from the Perſian Dominions.<note place="margin">Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Months after the Turkiſh Army being reinforced, the Vizier entring again into <hi>Perſia,</hi> overthrew the Trucmen who oppoſed him in his March, and deſtroyed the Gregorians, who were Friends to the Perſian, with a very great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; took <hi>Moroc</hi> their General, and cut off his Head: And adding to theſe Victories, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of having taken ſome few inconſiderable Towns, his Expedition ended without other Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, or Progreſs of their Arms. This ill Succeſs much troubled the Councils at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> for they conſidered that they had now waged an expenſive, laborious War, for the ſpace of three Years, without any Effect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Blood and Charge which maintained it, but rather to the Loſs and Damage of the Empire. The Souldiers abhorred the length and tediouſneſs of the Way, and the miſery of the March, being to paſs over vaſt Countries and Deſarts, where there was nothing beſides Rocks, Sands, and Barrenneſs. Many Horſes, Camels, and other Beaſts of Burden, periſhed for want of Nouriſhment; and where Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to be had, the Price was ſo exceſſive, that the Timariots and other Souldiers had not a Purſe to defray their Charges. The Enemy likewiſe was very ſtrong, for the Sofi was at the Head of forty thouſand brave Horſe, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infeſted the Ottoman Camp, beat their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys, and cut off their Proviſions, and ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them that they could not advance.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier <hi>Halil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Propoſition made by the Perſian for a Peace.</note> then General, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by theſe Diſaſters, was inclinable to accept of the Propoſition made by the Perſian, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould remain to his eldeſt Son in Fee, and to his Heirs and Succeſſors, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging to the Grand Signior a Tribute as great as the yearly Revenue which proceeded from it, at the time when it was in the Hands of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. But this middle Way ſeemed an Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſhonourable to the Greatneſs of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and that which argued puſillanimity and want of courage in the Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was rejected by the Council of State, as well as by the Military Men. Howſoever the Perſians taking their Meaſures by the diſpoſition they diſcovered in the Vizier thereunto, adventured to diſpatch an Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with tender of the ſame Project; but as he was cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and faintly received, ſo he was in a few days diſpatched with few words, and little reſpect, as if he had been ſent as a Spy to diſcover the State and Condition of the City,<note place="margin">Rejected by the Turk.</note> and the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Prince, rather than to obtain any Benefit by the Treaty. For now <hi>Amurat</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Years, increaſed in Spirit, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a Martial Courage; he began to leave his Delights, and Walks in Gardens, and the ſociety with his Mother and Women, and to aſſume thoughts of War and Government: ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained him in ſoftneſs and luxurious Paſtimes, were reproved by the Miniſters about him, and by them perſwaded to buckle on his Armour, and to delight in Martial Exerciſes: So that now new Meaſures were taken in all Affairs: And in the firſt place, <hi>Halil</hi> the Great Vizier was recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from being General in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the Paſha of <hi>Darbiquier</hi> put into his Place; and though he was Brother-in-Law to the Grand Signior, yet being eſteemed at Court as a Perſon who had amaſſed great Riches in his Employment, he was forced to diſgorge five hundred thouſand Crowns as an eaſe of his Burden, and an Atonement to pacify the Sultan for the Fault of his Misfortunes and ill Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Times of Licentiouſneſs and Revolt, the Pirats of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis,</hi> began alſo to caſt off their Reſpect and Reverence to the Ottoman Empire;<note place="margin">The Pirats of <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Algier</hi> trouble the Seas.</note> for being become Rich by the Prizes they had taken on Chriſtian Veſſels, they reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſet up for themſelves, and to eſteem the Peace which Chriſtian Princes had made with the Grand Signior, not to concern them; but as if their Governments had been independent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a particular Treaty, and diſtinct Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with themſelves: So that now daring to do any thing, ſix Veſſels of <hi>Tunis</hi> chaſed ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Ships into <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and there attaqued them, notwithſtanding that the Caſtle ſhot at them. They afterwards took a Dutch Ship, which had laden at <hi>Alexandria:</hi> and entring the Port of <hi>Salines</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> they engaged with two Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; the leſſer Ship made a good reſiſtance, but having no help, ſhe was thrice fired, and at laſt burnt: the other being a Ship of eight hundred Tuns, was cowardly ſet on fire by the Mariners, and abandoned, eſcaping aſhore with their Boats. Then they ſailed for <hi>Scanderone,</hi> where finding a Dutch Ship and a Polaca, they took both, and then landed. The Aga of the Scale, with all the Inhabitants, fled; ſo that finding no oppoſition, they ranſacked and robbed all the Ware-houſes, and afterwards ſet them on fire: The greateſt Loſs fell upon the Engliſh and Dutch, the firſt loſt about ten thouſand Dollars, and the latter about thirty thouſand.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe Loſſes, and breach of Peace, the Chriſtian Ambaſſadors much lamented; and complained, that if ſome Remedy were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied thereto, all Trade muſt be given over, no Security being to be expected in the Articles and Faith of the Grand Signior: To which, though the Vizier and Great Men did ſeem to yield a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Ear, and promiſe Redreſs: Yet being corrupted with ſome ſhare of the Spoils, and ſweetned with part of the Robbery, they began to reject the Memorials of the Ambaſſadors, and to allow the Pleas of the Pirats, as grounded on ſome ſolid Foundation of Reaſon and Religion: ſuffering them to publiſh Diſcourſes, that the Turks were obliged to maintain a perpetual War with the Chriſtians, as Enemies to their Law and Alchoran; and though Policy may ſuggeſt ſome Conveniencies by Peace with them, yet thoſe Conſiderations are Matters of Sin rather than of Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>To make all this good, the Divan of <hi>Tunis</hi> ſent two Deputies to remonſtrate the great Benefit and Advantage the Port received by the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and hoſtile Acts which they committed on the Chriſtians: And to inculcate this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the better, they declared, That they had lately taken two Gallies of <hi>Malta,</hi> out of the Spoils of which, they preſented unto the Sultan two Stirrups of Gold, with divers Slaves; two of which were Cavaliers, one of the Roman, and the other of the French Nation: thoſe which were Youths, and comely in ſhape and feature, were entred into the Service of the Seraglio; and the more ſtrong and robuſtous, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Service of the Gallies; ſo that the Turks were inwardly pleaſed with theſe Piracies, howſoever gave good words to the Chriſtian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39539:8"/>Ambaſſadors, promiſed much, and effected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>At that time Trade flouriſhed greatly in thoſe Parts, and had done much more, had it not been interrupted by the Piracies of <hi>Barbary;</hi> and the Trade was eſpecially ſo great with <hi>Venice,</hi> that a Turkiſh Merchant called <hi>Rodul</hi> Aga, whoſe whole Negotiation and Dealing was for that place, died worth a Million of Soltanees; of which, for want of Children, the Grand Signior became the ſole Heir.</p>
                  <p>But one Accident happened about this Time on the Seas, worthy to be recounted: The Seas (as we have ſaid) ſwarming then with Pirats, the General of <hi>Candia,</hi> with three Gallies, coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Seas for defence and protection of Merchant-Ships, arrived in the Port of <hi>Andro;</hi> from whence eſpying a Gally plying cloſe under the Shore, and believing her to be a Corſaire, or Pirat, made up to her; and becauſe it was a about the glimpſe of the Evening, ſo that ſhe could not be well known or diſtinguiſhed, the General raſhly charged her; and meeting a ſtout reſiſtance, many were killed before it was known that the Gally belonged to the <hi>Archipelago,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Fight at Sea by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Dervis Bei,</hi> one of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Captains: but ſo ſoon as the Miſtake was diſcovered, the Candiot General demanded of the Turk a thouſand Excuſes, returned him his Gally and Slaves again, and whatſoever was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, beſtowing with them an infinity of Complements, ſuppoſing that thereby the Spirit of the Turk being ſomewhat appeaſed and mollified, he would repreſent this Encounter with the more favourable Terms and Advantage at the Port. Notwithſtanding which Offices of Kindneſs, <hi>Dervis Bei,</hi> without farther loſs of time paſſed up to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> bringing his Gally in without Lantern, ſhot thorough, ill treated, and ſhattered, feigning himſelf alſo to be wounded; related, that he had loſt forty four Levents, and ſeventy ſeven Slaves which were killed; and that all the Haratch or Tribute-Mony, which was collected for the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Service from the ſeveral Iſlands, was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and embezled by theſe Candiots. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were aggravated by many Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and being aſſiſted with the Clamours of other Beys or Captains of Gallies; the Noiſe and Diſpute was exceeding high in the Divan, urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Venetians were obliged to make good a Loſs, which they had cauſed rather out of Malice than Miſtake.</p>
                  <p>At that time <hi>Georgio Giuſtiniano</hi> reſided at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> for the moſt Serene Republick; who to oppoſe the high Clamours of theſe Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, ſhewed Courage, and accompanied his Anſwers with Prudence and Reſolution, which are often very convincing in the Turkiſh Court. They alledged, that the Peace was broken. He anſwered, That it would not be the firſt time; and that they ought not to yield entire Credit to the Relation of Perſons paſſionate and partial in their own Cauſe: that ſuch Accidents as theſe, were as ordinary and common in the World as Cold and Heat, as fair and foul Weather; and that ſo ſoon as the Error was diſcovered, and the Gally known not to belong to <hi>Barbary,</hi> but to the Grand Signior, it was punctually and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, reſtored, with all the Excuſes imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, this Buſineſs which had ſo bad an Aſpect at the firſt, by the dexterity of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and giving ſomething to <hi>Dervis Bei,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to ſtop his Mouth, the Complaint ceaſed, and all farther Proceedings were ſuperſeded.</p>
                  <p>The Wars in <hi>Perſia</hi> being unſucceſsful, it was propoſed in Council, that a Peace ſhould be made, if poſſible, with <hi>Abaſſa</hi> Paſha; that his Demands,<note place="margin">Propoſals of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with <hi>Abaſſa.</hi>
                     </note> whatſoever they were, ſhould be granted, and promiſes given him of Honours and Preferment: But the inveterate Enmity and Hate which the Janiſaries bore him, and the difficulty there was to perſwade <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> that the Overtures made him were free and candid, and not mixed with Treachery and Deſign, were Obſtructions not to be obviated or overcome. Wherefore <hi>Abaſſa</hi> keeping mutual Intelligence with the Perſians, and receiving aſſiſtance and ſuccours from them, was become very formidable and ſtrong, and the Town of <hi>Erzirum</hi> well fortified with Works and a numerous Garriſon. Howſoever the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, his mortal Enemies, preſſing the Vizier to proceed againſt him, at length obliged him to beſiege the Place; which having done, and cloſely begirt it,<note place="margin">Erzirum <hi>beſieged.</hi>
                     </note> the moſt forward and brave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Janiſaries, were the firſt to ſcale the Walls, but were repulſed by the valour of ſtout and reſolute Souldiers; for they knowing that there was no other ſafety but in their Arms, and no other Mercy than an ignominious Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſt Reward of their Rebellion, refuſed to give or receive Quarter: Wherefore they made frequent Sallies on the Enemy, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Janiſaries of them as they took Priſoners, they immediately hanged about the Walls, as a ſpectacle of Horror to their Aſſociates. This Reſolution and Cruelty, deterred the Turks from their frequent Aſſaults and Storms made upon the Town; and the many Batteries and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, rendred the Place almoſt impregnable; ſo that there ſeemed no other hopes to remain, but to overcome them by a long Siege and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: But <hi>Abaſſa</hi> had ſo well provided againſt this Danger, with ſuch plenty of Proviſions, that the Turkiſh Army began to be more ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of Suſtenance than the Beſieged: ſo that becoming weary and diſcouraged amidſt ſo many Difficulties, they raiſed the Siege with ſuch diſorder and haſte,<note place="margin">The Siege raiſed.</note> that they left ſeveral Pieces of Cannon behind them; and retiring with ſome confuſion, were charged in the Rear, ſo that many Janiſaries fell a Sacrifice to the hate and revenge of the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>The News of this Succeſs coming to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> was ill received; but the Diſaſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, according to the uſual Cuſtom, was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Vizier who was General; for which Cauſe he was deprived of his Office, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictar Aga (who carries the Sword before the Grand Signior) was put into his place, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a fierce, bloody, and cruel Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>To theſe,<note place="margin">New Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles from <hi>Tattary.</hi>
                     </note> new troubles were added out of <hi>Tartary.</hi> For <hi>Mahomet</hi> the King of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, exalted to the Princely Dignity (as we have already declared) by the Favour and Election of that People, though contrary to the ſenſe and pleaſure of the Port, was now fallen from the good eſteem which they conceived for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gave ſome hindrance to their uſual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions on the Polonians and Coſſacks, out of memory and gratitude to the aſſiſtance they had contributed towards his Election; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being, as it were, famiſhed for want of their uſual Depredations, they refuſed to obey his Commands; and then openly threw off their Obedience to him as their Prince. The Turks, who always envied this Dignity to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> rejoiced to ſee this Diſcord between him and his People, and therefore thought it time to make uſe of this occaſion to re-inſtate <hi>Gherey</hi> the elder
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39539:8"/>Brother into the poſſeſſion of his Kingdom; whom the Turks, for his better ſecurity, having placed at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the uſual Retirement of the Tartarian Princes, diſpatched a Squadron of Gallies to fetch him from thence to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> where being arrived, he was received with a magnificent and Princely Entertainment by the Sultan: that ſo the Fame thereof forerunning his arrival in <hi>Tartary,</hi> the people might be better prepared to concur with the Port in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of him for their King. He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conducted to <hi>Caffa,</hi> the Grand Signior's Town in <hi>Tartary,</hi> with a ſtrong Fleet of fifty Gallies, where at his firſt landing he was received by <hi>Cant-Emir,</hi> a rich and powerful Tartar, and Chief of the Turkiſh Faction, and by many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with great honour and ſolemnity, with whom alſo a conſiderable Party moſt willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. But the Coſſacks of <hi>Poland</hi> and Circaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Friends to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Brother, joyning their Troops to his Forces, became too Strong for the Turks; for giving them Battel near the Incloſures of the <hi>Danube,</hi> at a place called <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det,</hi> they defeated them, and killed three or four thouſand of their Men, putting all to Fire and Sword round about; and entring on the Seas with their Fleet of Boats, took five of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Gallies: with which ill Succeſs, the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, which took part with <hi>Cant-Emir,</hi> being diſcouraged, abandoned their Colours and fled; ſo that <hi>Cant-Emir</hi> was forced to take Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary in <hi>Caffa,</hi> which being a Town belonging to the Grand Signior, it was hoped, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence they owed to that Name, would cauſe them to refrain all Violence thereunto. But the Tartars, provoked by this late effuſion of Blood, loſt all reſpect to that Government; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging the Town, they aſſaulted and took it, and therein the Son of <hi>Cant-Emir</hi> whom they cut in pieces, the Father eſcaping in a diſguiſe from the City.</p>
                  <p>The News hereof arriving at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was greatly diſpleaſing, and cauſed many ſerious Debates and Conſultations thereupon; the wiſeſt and moſt ſober of the Council was for diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Matter, and with their uſual dexterity to ſuffer what they could not remedy: for that it was by no means adviſable in the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of Affairs, to proceed unto an open Rupture with the Tartars, fearing leſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Perſians, and other Enemies ſhould make a benefit of this Occaſion, and joyning with a Nation ſo ſtrong in Horſe, ſhould dangerouſly preſs upon the Empire, and force them to the ultimate extremity of Affairs. Wherefore an Envoy Extraordinary was ſent to the Tartars, who covering the inward ſentiments of Regret and Anger, which the Sultan conceived for the late Diſgrace, ſeemed to wonder at the Cauſe and Reaſon of the laſt Engagement, as if it had been acted without the knowledg or order of the Grand Signior; and thus with gentle Terms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating, that the Surrender of <hi>Caffa</hi> would be very acceptable to the Port, and that which would atone for all miſcarriages, and be ſuch an offering of Pacification, as would reconcile all paſt Differences, and reſtore a perfect Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between the Sultan and them: the Tartars readily aſſented to the Demand, upon condition, that the Turks ſhould impoſe no other King upon them than him, whom by general conſent they had elected for their Prince.</p>
                  <p>Though Differences were thus concluded with the Tartars, yet the Coſſacks continued ſtill their Enmities, entring the Black Sea with eighty Saicks, which they ſo infeſted, that the Turks could for that Year avail themſelves little of their Navigation in thoſe Seas: ſo that the Turks, to curb theſe Inſolencies, gave Orders to build two Forts at the Mouth of the Black Sea: the Poliſh Ambaſſador made Complaint hereof, and proteſted againſt it, as an Act contrary to the Capitulations of Peace; but the Turks eſteem little of the Air of Bravadoes, whilſt they are not accompanied with ſomething elſe more ſolid than their own Levity.</p>
                  <p>But the grand Concernments which buſied the Thoughts of the Turks, was the Rebellion of <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> and the War in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the management of which was the charge and care of the Selictar Aga lately made Vizier, called <hi>Serches</hi> Paſha. His Head-quarters were at the beginning of this Year taken up at <hi>Iconium,</hi> called by the Turks <hi>Conie;</hi> and <hi>Abaſſa</hi> was encamped at <hi>Kaiſaria,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whom the Vizier marched; and being nearly approached, the Janiſaries earneſtly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that Battel might be given the Enemy; but the Vizier having received Inſtructions not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, if poſſible, but rather to enter into a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to propoſe Terms of Accommodation, delayed the Time, and with various Excuſes, eluded the preſent premures of the Janiſaries; at which they became ſo angry, that they flew into an open Mutiny,<note place="margin">The Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries mutiny.</note> cutting the Cords of his Tents, ſtoning him, and wounding him in the Head: by which open Violence, the Vizier being compelled to make known his Orders, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the chief Commanders of the Spahees and Janiſaries, giving them to underſtand, that the Grand Signior's Pleaſure was, to make up the Difference with <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> as the only means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude an inteſtine and unnatural War, and to be able to withſtand the Perſians, and regain the Country and Reputation which the Turks had loſt. This Propoſition ſeemed plauſible to the Commanders at the General Aſſembly, and more eſpecially, becauſe it was the Pleaſure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Grand Signior; but more difficult it was to incline the rough and obſtinate minds of the Janiſaries to a reſolutian ſo different to their Natures, and ſo contrary to that Revenge which they had deeply rooted in their Hearts, and ſworn to execute: howſoever the perſwaſions which the Officers uſed to their inferiour Souldiers, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in memory of the Blood of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and how deſtructive the continuance of ſuch a War muſt neceſſarily prove for the future by thoſe large effuſions of Blood which they muſt expect farther to make, were ſo prevalent upon them, that at length they condeſcended to a Treaty,<note place="margin">They conſent to treat with <hi>Abaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa.</hi>
                     </note> and to receive <hi>Abaſſa</hi> for a Friend and a Fellow-Souldier. <hi>Abaſſa</hi> at firſt ſuſpecting ſome Treachery, refuſed to give a private meeting to the Vizier; but the Vizier giving his Brother the Beglerbegh of <hi>Caramania,</hi> and the Paſha of <hi>Anatolia</hi> for Hoſtages, the Day and Place for a Conference was appointed; where both Parties meeting, Articles were agreed, That <hi>Abaſſa</hi> ſhould ſtill continue to be Paſha of <hi>Erzirum,</hi> his Son Paſha of <hi>Boſra,</hi> his Cahya, or Lieutenant, to be Paſha of <hi>Maraſch,</hi> (all which were Places on the Confines of <hi>Perſia</hi>) a general Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Amneſtie was to be given to <hi>Abaſſa</hi> and his whole Army, and the Articles ſworn unto in the moſt ſolemn manner by the Vizier, and confirmed in the publick Camp of the Janiſaries, who alſo promiſed to maintain this Word and Promiſe of the Vizier; to all which the Grand Signior gave his Hand, and affixed his Royal Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>A Reconciliation being in this manner, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, the City of <hi>Erzirum</hi> reſigned it ſelf to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39539:9"/>the Obedience of the Grand Signior, and the Army of <hi>Abaſſa</hi> was employed on the Confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and converted againſt the Enemy. The Vizier alſo was appointed to proceed on the ſame Enterpriſe; but his Army was ſo ill provided of all Neceſſaries, that he made his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and refuſed to march forward: But on the contrary, he returned to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in company with <hi>Abaſſa;</hi> where, with many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Friendſhip and Reſpect, he was conducted to the preſence of the Grand Signior to receive Honour, and the Reward of his Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and return to Obedience. The approach of theſe two great Perſonages near to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> made much noiſe and rumor in the City; ſome blamed the weakneſs of the Government for accepting an Enemy unto Favour, and that the crowning of his Rebellion with Rewards, was to encourage others in the like Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier was alſo murmured againſt for leaving the Army and the War,<note place="margin">The Vizier and <hi>Abaſſa</hi> make their Entry into <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </note> contrary to the Royal Command, by ſuch as were emulous of his Greatneſs: But as Envy is converted into Veneration, and ceaſes as Smoke doth, when it is blown up by the Flame of Succeſs and Glory; ſo thoſe who were emulous of theſe Perſons, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all obſequious Offices towards them; and diſſembling their Malice, went to meet them as far as <hi>Scutari,</hi> that they might add to their Train and Equipage, and help at the Solemnity of their Entrance. All People now caſt their Eyes on the Vizier and <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> as the two great Men of this Age; the firſt was eſteemed for his dexterous and ſucceſsful management in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over <hi>Abaſſa</hi> to his Submiſſion and Obedience; for though he was not famed much for his great Feats of Arms, yet this Reconciliation of <hi>Abaſſa</hi> was accounted a Maſter-piece of Policy, and better Service than a Victory. <hi>Abaſſa</hi> alſo drew the Eyes of the People, who crowded to ſee ſo great a Captain, that could contend with the Port, and put all <hi>Aſia</hi> into Diſturbance, and in concluſion could make the ſame Arms ſerve his Maſter, which had lately before given a check and ſtop to all the Ottoman Force. The Vizier was the firſt introduced to the Royal Preſence, where being graciouſly received, he was preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Veſt of Sables and a Cemiter ſet with Jewels. <hi>Abaſſa</hi> was afterwards admitted, and having performed his Obeiſance by touching the Ground with his Forehead after their faſhion; he declared, That he never was other than a faithful Vaſſal to the Sultan, and that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up Arms for his ſake, that he might ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the inſolence of the Janiſaries, and with their Blood revenge the Death, and ſacrifice to the Ghoſt of his murdered Brother <hi>Oſman,</hi> that they might learn to reverence their Princes for the future, &amp; learn to know how ſacred the Blood is of their Soveraign. The Grand Signior ſeemed kindly to accept this Apology, and as a Token thereof, beſtowed three Veſts upon him; which was a treble Honour of that kind, and made him Paſha of <hi>Boſna;</hi> on which employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he immediately entred: And though when ſuch offices are beſtowed, it is commonly the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom for that Perſon, who is inveſted in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment given, to kiſs the Sleeve of the Grand Signior publickly by way of Thanks: Yet, leſt ſuch Demonſtration of Honour ſhould ill affect the Eyes of the Janiſaries, and cauſe murmuring and repinings amongſt the moſt envious of the Souldiery, his laſt Audience was deſigned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and his Diſpatch procured in more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and familiar manner, and therefore more obliging than was uſual.</p>
                  <p>To yield ſome aſſiſtance to the preſent grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charges of the Empire, the Vizier impoſed a heavy Tax on the Chriſtians and Jews; on the firſt it was levied with all ſeverity;<note place="margin">The Jews at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> how treated</note> but the Jews found more favour by their Arts, and ſecret ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of Affairs, for they are a People of ſome Authority and Power in <hi>Turkie:</hi> they are curſed by particular Perſons, but careſſed by the generality: they are Slaves in all Countries, and yet acquire ſomewhat of Maſterſhip and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety: they are Vagabonds, and yet every Country is their own: they cannot buy lands, and yet daily increaſe their Fortunes: they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply in abundance, becauſe they all marry, and are not deſtroyed by Wars: they are great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidents of the Turks, and Enemies to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. In ſhort, Covetouſneſs in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is like a publick Courtiſan, to whom the Jews are the Panders and Ruffians.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior paſſing one day through the Streets, unhappily met with the Ambaſſador of the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> who becauſe he did not immediately deſcend from his Horſe in token of Reverence, he cauſed him and his whole Family to be impriſoned; but being afterwards excuſed by the Chimacam, to have only been a matter of inadvertency, his Omiſſion was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and ſo releaſed from his Reſtraint.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiery having for a long time been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by a looſe and gentle hand, continued their licentious way of living, committing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outrages on the Merchants and Inhabitants of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> againſt which many Decrees having been publiſhed, and Proclamations made, without any effect or notice of the Souldiery, the Vizier was unwilling to dally longer; and therefore taking a Spahee and a Janiſary, hanged them up, and cut off their Heads: and with ſuch courſe and method of Severity, he ſo aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the haughty Stomachs of the Souldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mortified by the aſſumption of <hi>Abaſſa</hi> into favour, that they began to yield unto Command, and to behold their Rulers with an eye of Reſpect, as thoſe which were ſeated in ſome degree above themſelves; for till now there was ſcarce a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Janiſary, but who thought himſelf to be the Creator or Elector of his General, and therefore to be little inferior to him in Power and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>And as this Vizier was ſevere towards the Souldiery, ſo he demeaned himſelf with equal rigour towards the Paſha's and Grandees of the Court; which though it was an Humor in the Vizier at that conjuncture, laudable and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet it procured him ſuch enmity, as removed him at a diſtance, and cauſed him to be ſent into <hi>Perſia</hi> to command the Army, and by that means to expoſe him to the hazard and difficulties of doubtful Succeſs in a dangerous War.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier being departed, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior appeared in publick on Horſe-back, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Brother by his ſide, an unuſual ſight amongſt the Turks: But the Queen-Mother, who in abſence of the Vizier ruled much, commanded that it ſhould be ſo. The Grand Signior had this Year a Son born, which cauſed great rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe there were few Males at that time ſurviving of the Ottoman Line; but ſcarce was the Feſtival ended before the Child died.</p>
                  <p>But let us now for a while withdraw our Diſcourſe from the Wars of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and look to the Actions in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania. Meh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the late King of <hi>Tartary,</hi> who was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the Port (as we have already related) was now dead; to whom ſucceeded a Kinſman
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39539:9"/>of his called <hi>Jembeg Gheray,</hi> univerſally pleaſing and acceptable to that People.</p>
                  <p>This new King, to demonſtrate his Proweſs, and to act ſomething acceptable to the Port, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched forty thouſand Horſe into <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> to ſack and ravage the Country; which dividing themſelves into ſeveral Parties, made their Incurſions as far as <hi>Socal.</hi> But in the mean time the Polonians and Coſſacks having formed a ſtrong Body of Horſe under the Command of <hi>Stephen Chmieleskie,</hi> met them at their return near to <hi>Burſtinow,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Tartars overthrown by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers.</note> where they gave them a total overthrow. And in like manner <hi>Staniſlaus Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomiskie,</hi> encountred another Party, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them, leaving thirty thouſand ſlain on the plaee, and taking two thouſand Priſoners, amongſt which was the younger Brother of the Tartar King.</p>
                  <p>This Defeat, as it was the greateſt that ever was given to the Tartars, ſo it is probable, that had it been well proſecuted at that time by the Polonians, they might have entred the <hi>Cherſone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Tauricus,</hi> and without much oppoſition have put an end to that Kingdom: But <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> had other Deſigns in hand; ſuch mixed Monarchies as that, being better able to defend their own Dominions, than to acquire or conquer others.</p>
                  <p>To this News ill received at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervened the unexpected Death of <hi>Bethlem Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Death of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
                     </note> unexpected, I ſay, becauſe that though he had been long labouring under the Diſeaſes of Dropſy and Aſthma, yet the greatneſs of his Soul, and activeneſs of his Spirit, maſtered for a long time his Indiſpoſition, ſo that he ſeldom or never omitted his Counſels and Buſineſs; and to the very time of his Death, was meditating and contriving Deſigns, whereby to preſerve his Dominions, and enlarge them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Government of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> required no leſs than ſuch a ſtirring Spirit: for being ſeated between two ſuch powerful Monarchs, as the Emperor and the Turk, there was need of dexterity and courage to ſteer between the Rocks of ſuch oppoſite Intereſts: Sometimes it was neceſſary to join with one, and anon with the other. So <hi>Sigiſmond Battori</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania,</hi> uniting his Forces with the Emperor's, in ſeveral Conflicts overthrew the Turk, and kept the Scale in an equal Ballance. <hi>Gabor</hi> on the contrary inclined to the Turks, and ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Intereſt with the Ottoman Power, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſuch Maxims as had been more ruinous to Chriſtendom, had he transferred them to a Son to imitate and purſue; but dying without Iſſue, the Government devolved to his Princeſs, by Vote of the States of the Country, and by Confirmation of the Turk, as we have already intimated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gabor</hi> knew ſo well how to deal and treat with the Turks, that he gained an abatement of ten thouſand Dollars of the annual Tribute; he managed his Affairs ſo ſubtilly with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, that he was always invited to a Peace, and accordingly made his Advantage by the Treaty.</p>
                  <p>The other Princes of Chriſtendom in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner courted him, and particularly the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> employed one <hi>Bornemis,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> a Lover of the French Intereſt, to be always about him; by whoſe means, and with the aſſiſtance of twenty thouſand Crowns of yearly Penſion, he obliged him to make War on the Emperor, at ſuch Seaſons as it ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated unto him to be moſt conducing to the advantage of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At length, as we have ſaid, giving way to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, he died on the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> after he had reigned eighteen Years: he was a Prince of great Abilities, but exerciſed them ill to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of Chriſtendom; howſoever he was a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of extraordinary Courage and Conduct, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun to manage his Sword at ſeventeen Years of Age; and as it is ſaid, had been enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in forty two ſeveral Fights. His Widow <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> Siſter of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> rendred an account to the Port of this Accident, and the Grand Signior immediately returned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer by <hi>Sulficar</hi> Aga, condoling the Misfortune, and encouraging her to a dependence on the Port: which ſhe accepting with due Reſentment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Obedience to the Grand Signior, and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Protection. But the weather was too boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and rude for a Veſſel to be navigated well under the Pilotage of a Woman; for the ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Country, between two mighty and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Monarchs, required more than a Feminine Mind and Courage to free and defend it from the Plots, Snares, and Violence with which it was, as with a toile, encompaſſed by thoſe two great <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Eaſt and Weſt. And though the Sultan undertook to defend his Female Ally, yet the diverſion of the Ottoman Arms in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the inteſtine Diſtractions, and the Minority of the Emperor were ſuch burdens on the Foundation of Empire, and obſtructions to great and Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick Atchievements in behalf of the diſtreſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that all the Promiſes made to her were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>available and ineffectual.

The firſt ſeemed a Matter very dubious and difficult; for that <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, had diſobliged the principal Boyards or Barons of the Country, and thereby derived an envy and hatred to all his Family: His long and violent Government annexed to the Intereſt of the Turk, had not only rendred his Memory odious to his own People, but likewiſe to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which would be ready to continue the like prejudice and averſion to any of the ſame Family, as it did to the laſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>For which Reaſons, after due and mature conſideration, it was reſolved to offer the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to <hi>George Ragotskie,</hi> a Perſon rich in Mony, and of great Intereſt, by reaſon of the Juriſdiction and Caſtles which he poſſeſſed in <hi>Hungary,</hi> belonging to his own paternal Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and in purſuance thereof, they ſent <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi> the ſecond Son, and <hi>Solomon</hi> a Kinſman of that Family, for Ambaſſadors to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting to him, that they had preferred his Merit before the Intereſt of their own Family;<note place="margin">The Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski.</hi>
                     </note> and therefore deſired him, that he would be pleaſed to take upon himſelf the Regency of the Principality.</p>
                  <p>The offer of Government was a ſavoury Bait to the Palate of <hi>Rogotski;</hi> which he embraced
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39539:10"/>with ſingular affectation and contentment, and was eaſily perſwaded on this occaſion, to take a Journey to <hi>Waradin,</hi> one of the principal For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and Places of conſideration in that whole Province, and was there received by <hi>Stephen</hi> the Ambaſſador, Governor of the Citadel, with firing all the Cannon, and with the common Joy and Feſtivity of the whole City. But in the midſt of this Mirth, an unexpected Meſſenger arrived with News, that the States had with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent elected another Prince, which was <hi>Stephen Bethlem,</hi> Father of the Ambaſſador, and Author of this Counſel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ragotski</hi> was ſtrangely ſurpriſed with this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, and the Ambaſſadors were put to the bluſh to ſee their Negotiations under ſuch a ſhameful defeat: Howſoever reſolving to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue conſtant to their firſt Election, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Intereſt of their own Family, they ſtill maintained the ſame obſequious Offices of Honour and Reverence towards <hi>Ragotski</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the Orders received from the States to abſtain from any other demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Honour to <hi>Ragotski,</hi> than what were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary towards a private Perſon of his Quality and Riches; and that he ſhould retire from the Confines of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> to the Precincts of his own Caſtles: yet they ſtill perſiſted to execute their firſt Commiſſion, and ſo to attract People to his Party; that the number thereof daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, it was at length agreed, that the firſt Election not being fair, the Point in Controverſy ſhould be determined at <hi>Sazburg,</hi> a City of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The States General being aſſembled, <hi>Ragotski</hi> accompanied his Pretenſions with a large effuſion of Gold, the moſt powerful and moſt convincing Argument imaginable: to which he added, That he had no deſign to affect the Principality, had not the ſame been firſt offered to him from <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Gabor</hi> the Father by the Hand of his Son: That it was very improper for that Perſon to offer a Dignity to another, which he affected for himſelf: that it was in the power of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvanians, not to have offered him the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality; but having once choſen him to it, they could not, without his diſparagement and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, retract from their Election.</p>

                  <p>By this time the Great Vizier was far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his Army into <hi>Perſia,</hi> having been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to proceed by the feigned Flight, or rather Retreat of the Enemy, who burned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and laid waſte all round them, as they retired; which put the Turks to ſuch inextrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Difficulties, that in two months March, they had all the Inconveniencies and Miſeries to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with, which commonly attend Armies in ſtrange Countries; the Plains through which they travelled were abandoned by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and void of Proviſions; the Mountains were covered with Snow and comfortleſs: and what was worſt, the Perſians kept all the narrow Paſſages ſo ſtrongly guarded, that the Vizier was now more in danger of Famine than of the Sword: but being a Perſon of great Senſe and Experience in Military Affairs, he prudently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingaged himſelf from the intricacy of theſe Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; and encamping his Army in the Plain of <hi>Amedan,</hi> he ſo provoked the hot Spirits of the Perſians, that they reſolve to aſſault him on that ſide of his Camp, which they judged to be the moſt weakly defended: of which having ſome advertiſement, he ſecretly laid an Ambuſcado in the way; which ſo happily ſucceeded, that he killed eight thouſand Perſians on the place:<note place="margin">A Victory gained by the Turks over the Perſians</note> but howſoever the Victory coſt ſo dear, and was ſo bloody, by the loſs of the ſtouteſt Janiſaries, and the braveſt of the Souldiery, that the News thereof made little noiſe or rejoycing at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this Intelligence the Vizier demanded new Recruits; for that beſides the abatement of his Numbers by the laſt Engagement, the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the Enemy increaſed, and his own Souldiers fled from their Colours; of which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being obſerved to enter <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſevere Decrees of Martial Law publiſhed againſt them, put the Grand Signior into a high Cholor and Indignation.<note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſending Men into <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </note> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to reinforce the Vizier's Army with all the Recruits that he was able, Proclamations were made, that all the Militia at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould immediately paſs over unto <hi>Scutari</hi> under their reſpective Commanders; and that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received one Aſper of Pay from the Grand Signior in quality of a Souldier, ſhould imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately paſs the Chanel into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and follow their Leaders to the War. But ſo great was the abhorrency which the Souldiers had to this March into <hi>Perſia,</hi> calling it the Sepulchre and Cemetery of the Turks, that few or none would obey, every one flying, hiding, and ſhifting for himſelf as well as he could: During which Fears and Troubles, the Ways from <hi>Perſia</hi> were ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the <hi>Curdes,</hi> that in the ſpace of three or four Months, no News arrived at <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> from the Army; which cauſed as great appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions and affrightments there, as if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire had been reduced to the utmoſt extremity. Nor did the Sultan want Jealouſſes and Fears of receiving Affronts from the Emperor, and King of <hi>Poland;</hi> the firſt of which had a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſented of regaining all <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> eſpecially at a time when that Country was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by two ſeveral Factions: but more preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and troubleſom were the Coſſacks,<note place="margin">The Coſſacks trouble the Turks.</note> who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infeſted the Black ſea; and to the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Imperial City, perpetually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed it with Alarms, paſſing up almoſt in ſight of <hi>conſtantinople.</hi> Of which Complaints being made to the Polonian Ambaſſador, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with ſome indignation, That the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks had reaſon for what they acted; for that ſince the Tartars had, by Orders from the Grand Signior, made their late irruption into that Country, as they could well prove from the Commiſſion taken amongſt the Baggage of the Prince of <hi>Tartary</hi> in the laſt Defeat, the Coſſacks might with all juſtice aſſume to themſelves a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Revenge.</p>
                  <p>But the Grand Signior not being able to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port this Affront, or to ſee himſelf braved on the very Banks of his Imperial Seat, and his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39539:10"/>Villages and Towns round about burnt and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged by a crew of Free-booters and Pirats, caſt all the blame on the Chimacham; to whom, in his rage, he gave ſuch a blow with his Fiſt on the Face, that Blood iſſued from his Noſe; and had not the Queen-Mother interceded for him, he had been delivered into the Hand of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to take away his Life. Nor was the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha in leſs danger at his return; becauſe, that upon his aſſurance, that the Coſſaks would not for that Year make any attempt in the Chanel of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Grand Signior had aſſented, that the Fleet of Gallies ſhould that Summer make a Voyage into the <hi>Archipelago:</hi> Which Miſtake having been the cauſe of all this Affront, the Captain-Paſha was to ſhare in the blame, and had likewiſe in the puniſhment, had not good Friends interpoſed between him and Danger.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Coſſacks ſatisfied with their late Plunder, but ſpeedily made another return with two hundred Boats; and though the whole Fleet of Gallies were then in Port, yet they had the boldneſs to proceed as far as <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Pillar, and thereby to hinder all Proviſions from paſſing to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by way of the Black-Sea. And what gave greater fear than all this, was the News which came at the ſame time, that the Poles were on the Frontiers with thirty thouſand Horſe; to whom immediatly a Chaous, or Envoy was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched with Propoſitions very advantagious to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> conditionally, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Irruptions made by the Coſſacks ſhould be ſtopped, and they reſtrained within the due Terms of Peace and Moderation.</p>
                  <p>The Chaous found a civil Reception from the <hi>Poles,</hi> and promiſes of Compliance, in regard that the King had ſome Intentions of making War upon the Muſcovite.</p>
                  <p>But whilſt theſe things were in agitation, and that the Chaous was ready to return, behold, on a ſudden News came, that ten thouſand Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars were broken into <hi>Podolia;</hi> which put all things back again, and ſo changed the ſtile of Affairs, that inſtead of Articles of Peace, the Chaous was again returned with the Menaces of War, and with Reproaches for the laſt perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Action.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe Troubles abroad, the puiſſance of the Ottoman Empire might have been able to have ſtruggled with greater Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had not its own Inteſtine Diſtractions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all things dangerous, and of a malevolent Aſpect.</p>
                  <p>The Government was at that time chiefly in the hands of the four Brothers-in-Law,<note place="margin">The Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Ottoman State.</note> who had married four Siſters of the Grand Signior's; and for that reaſon were powerful, and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the principal Offices of State, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drew contrary to the Opinions of the Mufti and Chimacham; which two laſt were not well accorded between themſelves, for that the latter encroached on the Office of the Mufti, to the great ſcandal and diſcontent of all the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and Literate Men in the whole City; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they both joined in conſultation by what means they might beſt ſecure themſelves and the Government from the Luſts and evil Deſigns of this quadruple Fraternity; but their Wiſdom and Intereſts were too weak to contrive Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies againſt ſuch high Oppreſſions; for beſides the Violences daily practiſed by the Brothers, the extravagant Humors in the Sultan himſelf, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Diſorders of State, and increaſed the Diſcontent and Diſſatisfactions of the People: For though <hi>Morat</hi> was naturally endowed with a good Wit and Parts, was ſtout, and of a good Courage: yet as his perpetual Debauchery in Wine rendred him in appearance but of a weak Underſtanding, mixed with much Levity, ſo it cauſed his Acceſſions of the Falling-ſickneſs (to which he was ſubject) to return often, whereby the ſtrength of his Brain was daily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>akened and impaired. He was negligent alſo in the performance of thoſe Ceremonies which his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were accuſtomed to obſerve; nor did he live with that gravity and regular Courſe which is agreeable to the Grandeur of ſo great a Prince: for ſometimes he would go out of his Seraglio with no other Attendance than of three or four Men, which were for the moſt part Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons, players upon the Gittern, and Eunuchs; and with no better an Equipage would he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſeen on Horſe-back, or in his Boat rowed on the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> with ſix Oars only: by which Actions, and other ſallies of Youth, he created ſuch a contempt towards his Perſon, that evil Men grew factious and weary, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Conſpiracies againſt his Life, whilſt the good Men feared and preſaged the ruin and downfal of the Empire: for neither Juſtice, nor Order, nor Obedience, prevailed; no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were conferred for Merit, but by Mony, or ſome other unlawful Means; there remained no Counſellors of true Faith and Integrity, nor Souldiers almoſt, either of experience for Sea or Land-adventures. The People, being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by double Taxes and Impoſts, were muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and ready to take the leaſt Fire of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; the Souldiery were diſorderly for want of Diſcipline and their conſtant Pay: the Paſha's of remote Provinces grew inſolent, taking upon themſelves rather an abſolute than a depending Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, all things looked with that black ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, that nothing ſeemed to keep the Frame of Empire together, but only the expectation of good Succeſs to the Army in <hi>Perſia;</hi> the which, as it depended on uncertain Events, ſo the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Monarchy was then ſhaking, and ſtood tottering on its deepeſt Foundation.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore all People being intent to hear of good News from <hi>Perſia,</hi> were much pleaſed to underſtand, that the Vizier having, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the laſt Engagement, laden his Army with Plunder and Spoils,<note place="margin">The Vizier prepares to beſiege <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi>
                     </note> was now preparing to beſiege <hi>Bagdat;</hi> for whoſe good Succeſs, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were daily made in the Moſchs; and the Schoolmaſters ſurrounded the Streets with their young Scholars, ſinging out Prayers with the <hi>Amen</hi> at every Period, according to the Cuſtom of that Country.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier marched towards <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to beſiege it about the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>September:</hi> In order whereunto, he amaſſed great abundance of all ſorts of Proviſions, and made his Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine of them at <hi>Moſul,</hi> two thouſand Camels, each laden with two Sacks of Cotton, every Sack being of about ten foot long, were carried to the Siege, for ſhelter of the Souldiery, and to fill the Ditches.</p>
                  <p>The Vizier having paſſed part of his Army over the River <hi>Tigris,</hi> the reſt with the Cannon remaining on the hither ſide, he diſpatched <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuf</hi> Paſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> with ſix thouſand Spahees, to take a view of the Place, and to diſcover the Avenues unto it. In his way thither, he met with eight thouſand Perſian Horſe ſent to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Gariſon, which he valiantly engaged; but being dangerouſly wounded, was forced to retreat, with the loſs of almoſt half of his Men, part killed, and part taken: thoſe which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:39539:11"/>were carried Priſoners to <hi>Bagdat,</hi> were treated with all civility by the Governor, who gave them a view of the Gariſon, which conſiſted of twenty thouſand effective Men; ſhewed them their Stores and Proviſions, and that there was ſcarce an unuſeful Mouth in all the City to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour them.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this Diſaſter at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,<note place="margin">The Siege</note> the Vizier nothing diſmayed, proceeded on his Deſign, ſpending the whole Month of <hi>September</hi> in making his Approaches. In the Mouth of <hi>October,</hi> he mounted eighteen Pieces of great Cannon, which for the ſpace of twenty five days bettered continually the Curtain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Baſtions, on which were four Pieces of Cannon not perceived by the Turks; there was alſo a deep and large Ditch not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them, for that it was planked over with Boards, and covered with a green Turf, ſo that it appeared like plain and firm Ground: the Breach being made, and ſeemingly undefended, the Turks reſolved to make an Aſſault; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Vizier, on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the Spahees, under the Conduct of the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> accompanied with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha's, Sangiacks, and other Perſons of Note; as alſo with Janiſaries, to the number of thirty thouſand, to enter the Breach: which being performed, and great numbers crowding on the Turf, the weight of them preſſed down the Planks; and therewith the whole Engine giving way, five or ſix thouſand were in a moment ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as it were, in a Pit-fall, and ſwallowed up without any poſſibility of Succour to be yielded from their Companions. After which on an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant there appeared fifteen thouſand Men on the Breach and on the Baſtions; which with their Cannon, and continual Vollies of Musket ſhot, ſo galled the Spahees, that they broke their main Body, and killed the Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> with other Peaſons of Note and Quality, and made the whole Army to retreat.</p>
                  <p>Two days after this Diſgrace,<note place="margin">The Siege raiſed.</note> the Vizier rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Siege, and marched towards <hi>Moſul;</hi> and the Perſians encouraged with this Succeſs, purſued the Turks with eight thouſand Horſe, aſſailed the Rear-guard of the Enemy; and though the Conduct and Care thereof was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the charge of the Paſha's of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> yet the Perſians killed three thouſand Turks, and had defeated the whole Rear of the Army, had not the Spahees turned their Horſes, and withſtood the ſhock with great Valour.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this diſhonourable Retreat, the Vizier loſt not his Courage, or hopes of taking the Town; in order unto which, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed all things neceſſary to renew the Siege again in the Months of <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> following, for that the foregoing Months are either too rainy, or too hot in thoſe Countries, to undertake a Deſign or Enterprize of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He fortified all the ſmall Places in thoſe parts round, and quartered his Souldiers in them; ſo that having all conveniencies of living, they might be induced to continue, and not abandon their Colours: eſpecially he took care to fortify <hi>Illay,</hi> a place of about two days journey from <hi>Bagdat,</hi> reinforcing the Gariſon with ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, under the command of three Begler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begs, in regard that it was a very conſiderable Paſs, and the principal Magazine and Granary of Corn and other Proviſion.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time he ſent Letters to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> repreſenting the ſtate of his Affairs to be in a hopeful condition; and deſiring Recruits both of Men and Mony, gave great aſſurances of conquering the City at the next Attempt.<note place="margin">The Poles and Turks make Peace</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this perrilous Condition of the Ottoman State, one would have imagined that Chriſtian Princes would have ſeen their own Intereſt, and made uſe of their advantage; but God not having as yet fixed a Period to the Bounds of this Empire, was pleaſed, by his ſecret Providence, to divert both the Emperor and King of <hi>Poland</hi> from making War with the Turk, inclining them to employ their Arms on their Chriſtian Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. For though the Chaous (as we have ſaid before) was returned from <hi>Poland</hi> with diſdain, and an angry Meſſage, yet the Chimacam, when he made <hi>Moſes</hi> Vayvod of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> encharged him to perform all Offices of Mediation between the Grand Signior and the Poles, perſwading them to reſtrain the Incurſions of the Coſſacks, and to ſend an Ambaſſador to the Port. In which affair <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo well performed his Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, that applying Lenitives to the Anger of the Poles, he reduced them to Articles of Peace, and to promiſes of reſtraining the Coſſacks, on condition, that the Turks reciprocally forbid and withhold the Tartars from joining or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording aſſiſtance to his Enemies the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conditions being agreed, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador was ſent from <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he was received with as much Joy, as he was expected with Impatience.<note place="margin">The Coſſacks and Tartars compared.</note> The Coſſacks and Tartars were two ſorts of people which lived equally on Spoils and Booty; the firſt as offenfive to the Turk, as the latter to the Pole; and therefore as it was an equal Benefit, ſo it was an Agreement of even Terms, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change the Caution given reciprocally for one and the other.</p>
                  <p>But the Engagement for ſuch wild People, was more eaſily given than performed; which becauſe it was a Point agreeable to both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was expreſſed with the moſt clear Words and ſtrict Terms poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The Poles were weary and grieved to ſee their Provinces depopulated by the Tartars, who yearly carried away ſome thouſands of Souls. The Turks on the other ſide were not leſs infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the Coſſacks, who captivated their People, burnt their Towns and Villages, and kept them in continual Alarms.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe People are hardly reſtrained from their Robberies and Pillaging, the Poles, as a Remedy, reſolved to carry the Coſſacks to the War againſt the Muſcovite; and better to ſecure the Tartar, the Poliſh Ambaſſador was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to pay them twenty thouſand Florins yearly, and ſix thouſand pair of Boots, according to the ancient Articles of Peace. On which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations the Tartars were engaged never to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Poland</hi> in a hoſtile manner, but to ſerve that King in his Wars againſt all Nations whatſoever, the Turks only excepted.</p>
                  <p>In this manner were the Turks this Year freed from all apprehenſions of Alarm from the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, and of War with <hi>Poland.</hi> And the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was ſo buſied concerning the ſurprize of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> and engaged in the Quarrel about that Dutchy, and with ſome ambitious thoughts relating to <hi>Italy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                     </note> that the Turks hoped to have proſecuted their Wars in <hi>Perſia</hi> without fear of Diverſion from the Weſtern Parts. But yet the Affairs towards the parts of <hi>Germany</hi> were not ſo well ſecured, but that the turbulent Spirit of <hi>Ragotski</hi> adminiſtred ſubject for Diſſention; for being lately ſeated (as we have ſaid) in his Principality, he was doubtful whether it were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39539:11"/>moſt for his Intereſt to incline unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or to the Turk; and whiſt both Parties courted his Friendſhip, and cheapned his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, (for of neceſſity he muſt be a Vaſſal to one or the other) the Heyducks who were Tenants to the Lands of <hi>Gabor,</hi> refuſed to return to the Obedience of the Emperor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding protection from the Grand Signior. The jealouſy of thoſe ill Conſequences which this Commotion might produce, alarmed all the Country: and the Emperor and <hi>Ragotski</hi> being hereby raiſed to a mutual Defiance, advanced their Troops one againſt the other upon the Frontiers: But all <hi>Hungary</hi> trembling with fear of thoſe Calamities which enſue from War, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of thoſe concerned, interpoſed ſo far to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Accommodation, that Deputies were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to meet at <hi>Caſſovia</hi> to treat of Peace. But in the mean time the Palatine of <hi>Hungary</hi> paſſing eight thouſand Men over the River <hi>Tibiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> to make ſeiſure of a certain Fort built by <hi>George Baſta,</hi> ſo alarmed and awakened <hi>Ragotski,</hi> that he diſpatched a Gentleman to him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Cauſe of this Motion; and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an anſwer agreeable to his expectation, he advanced upon him with an Army of ten thouſand Men, and engaging him with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, killed four thouſand on the place, and ſo cauſed him to retire: from theſe beginnings all the miſchiefs of a bloody War had certainly enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had not <hi>Ragotski</hi> refuſed to receive Succours from the Turk; but he depending on his own ſtrength (having fifteen thouſand Men in Arms for defence of his Hereditary Lands in <hi>Hungary</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all external Aſſiſtances, as ſavouring too much of vaſſalage and dependance: howſoever the Paſha's of the Frontiers aſſembled their Forces, and yet acted with ſuch caution, as not to proceed to an open Rupture; for the Wars in <hi>Perſia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſucceſsful and preſſing, required moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Lenitives on this ſide, that ſo the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now on the Frontiers might be transferred to an opportunity more ſeaſonable for diſpute.</p>
                  <p>In the month of <hi>September</hi> Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> being at his ſmall Seraglio called <hi>Daout</hi> Paſha, and ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there one night in his Bed,<note place="margin">The G.

                  <p>During all this time the Great Vizier wanting Succours and Supplies of Men and Mony, had great difficulty to contain his People in their due Obedience, or within the Bounds of their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for they were apt to leave their Colours, and would really have disbanded, had not their Spirits been daily held up with the hopes and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements of Pay and Recruits.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Illay reta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Turks.</note> which being taken by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, and by an abſolute force of Sword and Arms, the greateſt part of the Garriſion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eight thouſand Men, commanded by the three Paſha's before-mentioned, where cut off; which was an important loſs to the Turks; not only for the ſlaughter of ſo many brave Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, but alſo for the quantities of Proviſions, being the Granary and Magazine for the whole Army. Therein were likewiſe taken forty Field-pieces carrying eight pounds Bullet; with a great Chain of Iron, which uſually encompaſſes the Treaſury which is carried into the Field. With this ill ſucceſs the Vizier retreated from <hi>Moſul</hi> as far as <hi>Mirdin,</hi> from whence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled his Inſtances for Supplies for Men and Mony.</p>
                  <p>At length it was agreed, that an Army of thirty thouſand Tartars ſhould be ſent thither; but <hi>Ragotskie</hi> adviſing, that he was upon the point of breaking with the Emperor, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that their number ſhould be reduced to ten thouſand: the which taking their Journey into <hi>Perſia,</hi> by the way of <hi>Circaſſia,</hi> were there encountred by <hi>Han Gherey,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> (whom we formerly mentioned to have been depoſed by that People) and by him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their paſſage, the Van-guard of their Army being cut off by him; ſo that they were forced again to retreat and to embark their Men and Horſe at <hi>Caffa,</hi> to be tranſported by Sea to <hi>Trapezond;</hi> which as it was a matter of great trouble, ſo it was a courſe unpractiſed by the Tartars. The Grand Signior being unable to render a more conſiderable Succour than this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Army, which was now reduced to the weak number of two thouſand Janiſaries, and three thouſand Spahees, he reſolved to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Terms and Articles, as the only means to ſave his Honour, and the remainder of his Forces.</p>
                  <p>In order unto which, he releaſed a Perſian Lord from his Impriſonment in the Seven Towers, and qualified him with the Title of Ambaſſador, beſtowing upon him an Equipage of Men and Horſe agreeable to his Character, with four thoſand Dollars to defray his Expence. And that the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> might be aſſured of the Sultan's real Intentions and deſires of Peace, he recalled his Army in the Spring, whereby all Acts of Hoſtility ceaſed: And thus the Vizier being returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that Pride and Rigour which he exerciſed towards all in the time of his proſperity, laid him low by Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:39539:12"/>tunes in the eſteem of his Enemies; who gladly embracing the opportunity to diſgrace him, with all the terms of Obloquy and Detraction,<note place="margin">The Vizier deprived of his Office.</note> deprived him at length of his Office. One of the four Brothers-in-law married to one of the Grand Signior's Siſters, and Prime of the Cabal, being conſtituted Vizier in his ſtead. Nor did the late Vizier eaſily eſcape with his Life, until he had repreived it with an Atonement of an hundred thouſand Zechius of Gold, and ſome choice Horſe, which he preſented to the Sultan; the like Example other Paſha's his Compainions followed in proportion to their Eſtates and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; by which Preſents the empty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury was in a manner recruited, and the preſent Neceſſities of the Sultan relieved.</p>
                  <p>But this new Vizier enjoyed not long either his Honours, or his Life; for the firſt Act he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was to mitigate the <hi>Valedé Sultana,</hi> or Queen-Mother, to obtain a Hatteſheriff, or Writing, under the Grand Signior's Hand for cutting off the Head of <hi>Caſref</hi> Paſha, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heeler Agaſi;</hi> or General of the Spahees, which being executed by <hi>Morteſa</hi> the Commander in Chief in <hi>Perſia,</hi> his Head was brought and thrown at the Gates of the Divan.</p>
                  <p>The Spahees aſtoniſhed at this Spectacle, and enraged to ſee that Head on the Ground which they ſo much eſteemed and loved, forgot all the Terms of Duty and Obedience to their Superiors; and without regard to the Place wherein they were, even within the Walls of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Court,<note place="margin">Mutiny of the Spahees joined with the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> they threw Stones at the Vizier, and beat him from his Horſe; which though the Grand Signior, and all the Viziers highly reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as the moſt ſcandalous Indignity that could be offered to the Majeſty of a Supreme Ruler, and to all Government, yet their Counſels ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſought Remedies to ſuppreſs the Mutiny, than to make Propoſals of executing Juſtice on the Offenders; for the Spahees ſeconded by the Janiſaries, (who were glad of any cauſe to make a Commotion) aſſembled in the <hi>Hippodromo,</hi> from whence they ſent an Arz to the Sultan, requiring the Heads of the Great Vizer, and of divers others, as well within as without the Seraglio. The Grand Signior denying poſitively to aſſent hereunto, the Souldiery as plainly threatned to depoſe him, and place his Brother in the Throne; at which barbarous Reſolution the Grand Signior being affrighted, his youthful conſtancy was ſo ſhaken, that he wrote to his Mother to deſire her excuſe, in caſe he aſſented to the death of her Son-in-law the Great Vizier; for that the Storm of the Military Fury was ſo great, that he could not endeavour to protect him without the loſs of his Life and Crown: wherefore the Vizier being turned out of the Gates of the Seraglio, he was immediately butchered in the preſence of the Sultan.</p>
                  <p>Nor did the impetuous Rage of the Souldiery end here, but they proceeded farther to demand the Head of the Janiſar-Aga, or General of the Janiſaries, who was reputed the chief Inſtrument of the Death of <hi>Caſref,</hi> becauſe he was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Favourite to the Grand Signior; but he wiſely taking divers off with Mony and Preſents, ſowed diviſion between the Janiſaries and Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees; ſo that ſome Difficulty ariſing hereupon, the determination of his Death was deferred for a while; howſoever they proceeded to demand, that the Mufti ſhould be diſcharged of his Office, and that the Tefterd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, or Treaſurer, ſhould be delivered into their hands.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt the Grand Signior aſſented; but being willing to ſave the other, he pretended, that he was eſcaped and fled; but when he was found, he ſhould run the ſame Fate with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier. But the military Sedition not being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed with this Anſwer, they roved through the whole City, and <hi>Galata,</hi> and other parts of the Suburbs: the Spahees perſiſting to require the Head of the Janiſar-Age, and not finding him in his Houſe, they plundered it, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and meeting with a Youth, a Favourite of the Grand Signior's, they killed him; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with the like Fury to the Seraglio, they required admiſſion to the New Vizier and Mufti. <hi>Regep</hi> Paſha, another of the Brothers-in-law, was then made Vizier, who with the new Mufit trembling at theſe Tumults, were careful to treat the Souldiery with all lenity and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion imaginable, deſiring them to declare their Grievances, and whatſoever might give them Satisfaction ſhould be granted. The ſeditious Souldiers replied, That they were reſolved to ſee the Grand Signior's Brother, for that when the preſent Sultan did not govern well, they might know from whence to produce another of better Abilities, and more agreeable to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>That neceſſity which cauſed the late eaſineſs of condeſcenſion to former demands, made way alſo for compliance with this; ſo that the young Prince being brought forth, they obliged the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan not to attempt any thing againſt his Life, and cauſed the Vizier and Mufti to become Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Security for it.</p>
                  <p>Nor did theſe Conceſſions contribute towards a Pacification; but rather their Inſolence increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thereby, renewing their Exclamations at the Gates of the Seraglio for the Heads of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar-Aga and the Teſterdar; not would they be ſatisfied with anſwer, that theſe Men were not found in the Seraglio, but ſtill perſiſted in their rude Out-cryes and Menaces, loſing all reſpect and reverence to the Sultan and the Superiors; ſo that the Grand Signior reſolved once to ſally out upon them with his own Guard; but trying their Temper and Reſolution, he diſcovered moſt of them to be poiſoned with the like Spirit of Sedition, and combining with the others as Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates in the Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Viziers, and other principal Officers, perceiving the Mutiny to increaſe daily, and not knowing to what degree it might ariſe, made it their buſineſs to ſearch out for thoſe proſcribed by the Souldiery: at length the Aga was happily diſcovered by a certain Perſon, to whom a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was given of a thouſand Zechins, with the Office of Zorbaſi or Captain; and the Aga con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing that he had counſelled the Death of <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ref,</hi> he was immediately ſtrangled, and his Body hanged upon a Tree to publick view. The like Fate befel the Teftardar, who being alſo taken, was killed and hanged up together with the Body of the Aga.</p>
                  <p>All which Perſons thus inhumanely murdered by the Souldiery, were the Enemies of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Great Vizier <hi>Regep;</hi> for which cauſe the Grand Signior ſuſpecting that he ſecretly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and nouriſhed theſe Rebellions, never after looked on him with a gracious eye. Of which the Vizier being ſenſible, combined with the Souldiery; and judging it almoſt impoſſible to ſet himſelf right in the Affection of his Maſter, he courted the Favour of the Militia, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to protect his Life, and maintain his Power. But as the revenge of Princes is not like a Thunder-bolt, which wounds on a ſudden, but rather like a Mine which requires time to form, and is then ſprang, when it may do the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:39539:12"/>beſt execution: ſo in the ſame manner, the Grand Signior diſſembled his hate towards the Vizier,<note place="margin">The Vizier ſrangled by Order of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier.</note> until one Night being preſent with him in the Seraglio to ſee certain Fire-works, he called him aſide, and whiſpered to him, that he ſhould go into his private Lodgings; where being entred, the Door was ſhut upon him, and he ſtrangled by certain Eunuchs, who were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attend him for that purpoſe. But little benefit or riches did the Grand Signior. reap by his death; for the Vizier having for ſome time expected this Blow, had concealed his Treaſure, and conveyed it away for the uſe of his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The like hatred did the Sultan conceive againſt the Souldiery, reſolving in his mind to execute his Revenge, eſpecially on the Janiſaries, as the moſt turbulent Fomenters of Rebellion and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to vent his Anger, either by the Cord or Sword, or ſome other more expedite way, as opportunity preſented: and to prevent or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the like Seditions for the future, he fortified the Seraglio, and brought Arms in thither by night, chuſing into his Guard ſelect Men of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Faithfulneſs: and being ſenſible, that the being of his Brother attempered his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and drew away the Hearts and Eyes of his Souldiers and People from fixing entirely on his own Perſon; he therefore intended to cut him off; but the Caution and Security given by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and chief Miniſters, to preſerve his Life, diverted him from this Reſolution.</p>
                  <p>In place of the deceaſed Vizier, <hi>Mehmet</hi> late Paſha of <hi>Cairo</hi> was conſtituted, and the Seal conſigned to him; with whom the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or conſulting to him; which whom the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or conſulting of the preſent Emergency of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, often uttered his diſpleaſure againſt the late Seditions, and ſignified his Intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs them for the future; in order unto which, he cauſed the Heads of the moſt mutinous Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees to be cut off, and on various Pretences ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the Souldiery each from other into divers Parts; ſome numbers of Janiſaries he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to march to the Confines of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and cauſed many others of them to be killed by Night; and by various other Means greatly weakned the Chambers, both by diminiſhing the Numbers, and taking off ſuch who were the Men of beſt Courage and Conduct: many Bodies were found ſwimming in the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and known to be Spahees; great part of the Lands the Pay of the Spahees was abated; and divers Offices of Profit and Honour were taken from the Militia, that ſo Men might be made ſenſible of the Indignation of their Prince, and that there is no Sport or Jeſting with the Anger of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked King, who knows no other mean of his Paſſion, than the total evaporation of his Choler and Vengeance.</p>
                  <p>To maintain and make good theſe ſeveral Acts of Juſt Puniſhment, young <hi>Morat</hi> growing in Courage with his Years, mounted on Horſe-back, well Armed, and like a Souldier, attended with a ſelect Party of Cavalry, paſſed through the moſt publick Streets of the City in a huffing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and caſting a ſtern Eye upon the Souldiery and People as he went, and making a hundred Paſſes through the midſt of them, ſtruck them with an awe of his Majeſty, and admiration of his Warlike and Martial appearance; with which Severity and Gallantry the Souldiery being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted, began to conſider, that they were not longer to be governed by a Woman, or a Child, but by the moſt brave Prince that ever ſwayed the Ottoman Scepter; and thereupon for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſolved upon an impartial Submiſſion and Obedience unto him. To encourage them in which, and to reconcile their Spirits and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to him, <hi>Morat</hi> oftentimes aſſembled his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery at <hi>Ackmeidan,</hi> where he exerciſed with them, ſhooting with the Bow at Marks and at Rovers, rewarding thoſe who ſhot beſt, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Aſper a day to their Pay; beſides which, he diſtributed ſix thouſand Hungars amongſt them, to demonſtrate that wiſe Princes are uſed to mix Lenitives with their Rigour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Mutinies and Seditions in the Captial City, encouraged Rebellious Spirits in divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places: ſo that a certain Bold and Audacious Fellow, drawing a number of Miſcreants after him, poſſeſſed himſelf of the City of <hi>Pruſa:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the ſame Temper, called <hi>Elia</hi> Paſha, made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Magneſia,</hi>

But the Beglerbey of <hi>Anatolia</hi> ſuffered not <hi>Elia</hi> to reign long in his luſt, but giving him Battel in thoſe Plains, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defeated him, and ſent twenty of the Heads of the chief Commanders to the Sultan for a Preſent; and purſuing <hi>Elia</hi> and the reſt of his Army to <hi>Magneſia,</hi> beſieged him in that City. The Grand Signior being adviſed hereof, and fearing leſt the Siege ſhould take up too much time, and move other ill Humors in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, diſpatched Orders to offer Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Accommodation with <hi>Elia,</hi> which were ſecretly treated, and great Promiſes made him of Favour and Rewards from the Grand Signior. The eaſie Fool accepted the Conditions, and embraced the Promiſes; and leaving his City of <hi>Magneſia,</hi> proceeded confidently to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to receive the gracious Rewards of the Sultan for his paſt Services. At his Entry into the Seraglio in place of the <hi>Kapiſlar-Kahyaſee,</hi> or Maſter of the Ceremonies, he was received by Officers with a Cord in their Hands, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him the gracious Reward of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ultimate Favour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Rebellions were no ſooner ſuppreſſed in <hi>Aſia,</hi> but that other Mutinies of the Janiſaries,<note place="margin">Mutinies at <hi>Buda.</hi>

                  <p>To remedy theſe Diſorders, and extinguiſh the Mutiny, the Grand Signior ſent Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to examine the Matter, and to render him an account of the Grieveances and Demands of the Souldiers: but they fearing to be ſurpriſed with ſome ſevere Acts of Juſtice, prevented or foreſtalled the Inquiries of the Commiſſioners, by acknowledging their Fault, and demanding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, with ſurrender of four of the Ring-leaders to Puniſhment; declaring, That by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement and evil perſwaſions, they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched into that diſorderly courſe of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: the Sultan accepted the Sumiſſion, and all things were quieted in <hi>Hungary.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amurat</hi> had now born to him a ſeventh Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by his Slave called the <hi>Shining Star;</hi> and though he was much troubled that ſhe had not brought him forth a Son and Heir, yet ſo much was ſhe beloved by him, that he reſolved to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate her Queen, had not his Mother declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as a thing not uſual for any Woman to be honoured with that Title before ſhe had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Inheritance by the Birth of a Male Child.</p>
                  <p>And that he might now totally extinguiſh the Fire of Sedition amongſt the Souldiery, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Ferdum Efendi</hi> and <hi>Saluc</hi> Age, two prime Chiefs of the Spahees, with eight principal Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, to be put to Death; after which ſeverity, fearing another Inſurrection, he paſſed the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and retired to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi> where he fortified himſelf.</p>
                  <p>It happened about that time, that a Turkiſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a Slave, was found aboard a French Ship, ready to ſail from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which the Turks highly reſented, and aggravated the Crime ſo much againſt the French Ambaſſadour, that they impriſoned his Son then embarqued, and would have confiſcated the Veſſel and her Lading. In thoſe days the Chriſtian Ambaſſadors reſident at that Court, kept better Union and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence among themſelves than they do at preſent; ſo that all of them, as concerned, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to repreſent before the chief Miniſters, that ſuch a Fault merited not ſo grand a Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for that it was moſt probable to have been committed without the privacy either of the Ambaſſador, or Commander of the Ship. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors then reſident were Sir <hi>Peter Wych</hi> for <hi>England,</hi> the Sieur <hi>Marcheville</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Pietro Foſcarini</hi> for <hi>Venice;</hi> at whoſe warm and urgent Inſtances the Turks condeſcended to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the Veſſel, and the Goods laden upon her, with free liberty to depart. Howſoever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repreſented to the Grand Signior by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha (who is Admiral of the Seas) that one <hi>Baldaſar,</hi> an Armenian by Nation, but Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goman or Interpreter to the French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, was a principal Inſtrument to move the Ambaſſadors to unite in this Pretence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſerved to manage the Intereſt of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with warm and earneſt Sollicitations, the ſurly Sultan grew ſo angry, that one of his own Slaves ſhould preſume to manage a Diſpute with him,<note place="margin">The French Interpreter impaled.</note> in Fury and Rage, commanded that he ſhould be immediately empaled; and that he might be aſſured that his Sentence took effect, he would ſee him with his own Eyes on the Stake before he would paſs the Water to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari.</hi> The reſolution was ſo ſudden, and the Execution ſo ſpeedy, that there was neither Ear lent to hear, nor Time given to mediate in his behalf; and the Act being performed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints would not ſerve to redreſs a tyrannous Action now paſt Remedy, and not to be recalled: Wherefore as the Ambaſſadors were forced to acquieſce, and patiently endure the Affront; ſo if they would have reſented it, they could ſcarce have found one amongſt their Interpreters of ſo bold a Spirit, who durſt have opened his Mouth after ſo terrifying an Example. The truth is, the Dragomen, or Interpreters to Ambaſſadors at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> are required to be Men of Learning, Courage, and Courtſhip; their ſtudies ought to endue them perfectly with the Turkiſh, Greek, and Arabick Languages, with ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg alſo of the Perſian, and with good Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and readineſs of Tongue: their conſtancy and preſence of Mind is always neceſſary at their appearance before thoſe Grandees or Great Men, who are ever proud, haughty, and arrogant in all their Expreſſions and ways of Treaty, the which they commonly manage towards Chriſtian Miniſters with the ſame reſpect which we uſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Servants, or our Slaves. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by reaſon of this and other Preſidents of like nature, Dragomen have been always timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in repreſenting the true ſence of the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors and Conſuls; at leaſt have ſo minced and tempered their words, that they have loſt much of that Vigour and Accent which is neceſſary to inculcate perfectly a Buſineſs into the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a Turk, eſpecially if you intend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to Reaſon and Juſtice. Wherefore it would be an excellent Qualification for an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour himſelf to underſtand and ſpeak the Turkiſh Language, or at leaſt to have a young Man by his ſide of the Engliſh Nation, educated in the Turkiſh Court, who ſhould be ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate thoſe Matters which are too thorny and prickly for Subjects of that Country to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</p>
                  <p>Had all the foregoing Troubles, Mutinies, and Misfortunes encountred the Spirit of an eaſie and a gentle Sultan, certainly the Fate of this <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> had been the ſame with that of <hi>Oſman,</hi> who retiring within his Seraglio, could never have appeaſed the Seditious Humor with all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions he could give an unreaſonable multitude: but being a reſolved and buſling Prince, he at firſt gave ſome few ſteps backwards, as if he would yield ſomewhat to the impetuoſity of that Torrent which he could not reſiſt; yet it was only like a Ram, who retires, that he may butt with the greater force. Howſoever the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and ſober Men attributed the true cauſe of all theſe Commotions in the Souldiery, to have no other Foundation than the ill ſucceſs and miſeries which attended the War in <hi>Perſia;</hi> for the way being long, and the Countries hot, barren, and for the moſt part void of all comfort, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers abhorred the Fatigues and March thither; and hated to conſider, that they ſhould be made a Sacrifice to the luſt of voluptuous Miniſters, who, to gain Eſtates and Riches out of thoſe Monies which were deſigned to carry on the War, did not care, whilſt they lived at Eaſe and in Delights, what Labours, Wants, and Dangers attended the Militia.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations made likewiſe ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Sultan, who therefore inclined to hearken unto thoſe Propoſitions of Peace which were brought him by an Ambaſſador from <hi>Perſia;</hi> and being accompanied with very great Preſents,<note place="margin">The Peace made with <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſpeedily broken.</note> the Peace was clapt up and concluded on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. But as Things quick in their Birth and Production, are not long-liv'd, nor long durable; ſo this Peace was broken the ſame Year with an inconſtancy equal to that inconſideration with which it was agreed and ſigned. For no ſooner was the News hereof flown into the Eaſtern World, than the Great <hi>Mogol</hi> diſpatched his Ambaſſador with Letters to the Grand Signior, perſwading him to make War again with the Perſian, promiſing to aſſiſt him therein, by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up the Paſſage of <hi>Nachivan,</hi> which is a City in the Leſſer <hi>Armenia,</hi> built upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Aranes,</hi> and is the common Road into the

                     <hi>Indies.</hi> The which Motion, as it was pleaſing to <hi>Morat,</hi> ſo being accompanied with Indian Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities and Preſents of an ineſtimable Value, the Ambaſſador was graciouſly received, and treated with ſuch Feaſts and Entertainments as are not uſually known amongſt the Turks; and returned again with Letters, giving hopes, that he would ſpeedily take an occaſion to break with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian. But thoſe who had experienced the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of a War with <hi>Perſia,</hi> and obſerved, that in the preſent Conjuncture of Affairs it might be more eaſily and with advantage waged on the ſide of <hi>Hungary,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a War againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</note> endeavoured, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pregnant Arguments, to perſwade the Grand Signior thereunto, giving him to underſtand, that <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> being victorious over the Emperor in <hi>Germany,</hi> had taken many Towns and Cities of great ſtrength; and having overthrown him in divers Battels; had ſlain or taken his beſt Captains and moſt Martial Men of Valour; and that other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who were deſirous to abate the pride of the Auſtrian Family, were ready to embrace the ſame Conjuncture, whereby they might entirely ſhake off the Yoke and Servitude to the Imperial Tyranny.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Advantages being well repreſented, took place eaſily in the mind of <hi>Morat,</hi> ſo that he diſpatched expreſs Orders to the Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> to aſſemble his Forces, and put all things in a readineſs on the Frontiers: in compliance with which, though the Paſha ſet forth his Tents, and made great appearance of a March, yet ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns cauſed him to move ſlowly, and to affect a Peace rather than a War; ſo that receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ambaſſador from the Emperor at <hi>Peſt,</hi> he readily Admitted him, and gave him ſafe Conduct and Convoy unto <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> at which time Advices coming, that the Great <hi>Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> was ſlain, and that the Affairs of the Swedes went backwards and unſucceſfully in <hi>Germany,</hi> altered all the Meaſures of the Ottoman Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and though <hi>Ragotski</hi> endeavoured all he was able to foment the Differences, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Turks to a War, having beſides other ſpecious Pretences, an Army of thirty thouſand Men in a readineſs to joyn with the Turks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Emperor; howſoever the Turks look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Condition of the Swedes as deſperate, and the Proffers of <hi>Ragotski</hi> to be uncertain, and of no true Foundation,<note place="margin">A Peace made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperor and Grand Signior.</note> and the State of Affairs amongſt themſelves to be turbulent and unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, gave a kind Reception to the Emperor's Ambaſſador, and ſigned the Agreement for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Truce.</p>
                  <p>By this, and other Actions of like Nature, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski</hi> loſt much of his Eſteem with the Emperor and the Grand Signior; the firſt always looked on him as an Ambitious Prince, exciting the Turk againſt him, and ready on the leaſt Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to enter his Country with Fire and Sword: The other looked on him as a Falſe Friends, who never made Proffers, but thoſe which ſquared with his own Deſigns and Intereſt; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly he had diſguſted the Port, by preſuming to inſtate one <hi>Matthias</hi> in the Principality of <hi>Walachia,</hi> and to eject another conſtituted there by Authority of the Grand Signior, called <hi>Stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Bei,</hi> or Lord <hi>Oyſters,</hi> becauſe his Father was a Fiſher-man, and gained a good Eſtate by the Trade of Oyſters; howſoever it being the Grand Signior'd Pleaſure to ordain ſuch a Perſon to that Office, it was a Preſumption, and a bold Piece of Uſurpation in <hi>Ragotski,</hi> to diſpoſe of that Government, by virtue of his own ſingle Power: Howſoever the Grand Signior, to avoid Contention with the reſolved Spirit of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> confirmed <hi>Matthias</hi> upon Condition of a double Tribute paid for the Inveſtment to the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>

                  <p>The Captain-Paſha in his Paſſage by Sea,<note place="margin">A Fight of the whole Turkiſh Fleet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt two Engliſh Ships.</note> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred two Engliſh Ships lading Corn in the Gulph of <hi>Vola,</hi> called the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Ralph,</hi> and <hi>Hector:</hi> this being a prohibited Commodity, not to be tranſported under penalty of forfeiting Ships, Goods, and Liberty of the Men, moved the Paſha, with the ſight of ſuch a Booty, to command his Gallies to ſeize the Veſſels; which being only two, it was imagined that they would immediately yield and ſurrender without conteſt. But theſe bold Brittons knowing the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſuch a Surrender, reſolved not tamely to yield themſelves, at leaſt to ſell their Liberties, Lives, Ships and Goods to the Turks at the deareſt Rate they were able: wherefore cutting their Cables, put themſelves under Sail, and got into the main Sea, fighting with the whole Fleet above three hours; ſometimes they were boarded by one Gally, ſometimes by two at once; but plying their Quarter-deck Guns with ſmall Shot, and defending themſelves manfully with their half-Pikes, they often cleared their Decks, and put off the Enemy with great ſlaughter: the Captain-Paſha being aſhamed to ſee ſuch Reſiſtance made by two ſuch Veſſels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his whole Force, reſolved to enter his Men at the Gun-room Port of one of the Ships, and running the Prow of the Gally into the Stern-port, the valiant Crew of the Gun-room clapt an Iron Spike into the Trunnel-hole of the Prow, whereby the Gally being wedged faſt to the Timbers of the Ship, they brought their Stern-chaſe laden with croſs Bars, pieces of Iron, and Parteridge-ſhot to bear upon them; which raking them fore and aft,<note place="margin">The Capt.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:39539:14"/>the Baſtard Gally. At length having ſpent all their ſhot, they charged their Guns with pieces of Eight, and being over-powered by numbers of their Enemies, and not able farther to reſiſt, they ſet fire to their Ships, which blowing up, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed two or three of the Gallies which laid by their ſides, together with thoſe Men which were then fighting aboard at handy-blows on the Deck with the Defendants; ſo that none of the Engliſh were taken, unleſs three or four fiſhed out of the Water.</p>
                  <p>An end being in this manner put to the Fight, the Turks gained the Victory, with the loſs of twelve hundred Slaves killed and wounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Turks, and were forced into Port, where they remained a full Month to repair their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; the which Fight affected all Turks with an aſtoniſhment of the Engliſh Bravery, or Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, (as they call it) and is a Matter remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and talked of to this Day, eſpecially by the Son of the Captain-Paſha who was ſlain, called <hi>Omem,</hi> Paſha <hi>Ogli,</hi> who is Paſha of <hi>Rhodes</hi> at preſent, (as I remember) and commands three or four Gallies; for which reaſon he is ſo inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemy to the Engliſh, that to ſatisfie his Revenge, he buys what Engliſh Slaves he can get into his Gallies, and ſells none out under a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Price or Ranſom.</p>
                  <p>The News of this Fight coming to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> provoked the Grand Signior to the height of Indignation; howſoever the Officers either being aſhamed of their Loſs, or entertaining ſome ſecret admiration of the Engliſh Bravery, ſuffered the Matter to be compounded for the Sum of forty thouſand Dollars, of which the Engliſh paid only their ſhare with the French and Venetians, whom (for I know not what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) the Turks equally concerned in the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Turks were appointing a new Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha, and again refitting their Fleet, the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> diſpatched a Summons to <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardin</hi> to ſurrender <hi>Seida</hi> up to him, with other Caſtles and Places of Strength. The Old Man reſided then a <hi>Barut,</hi> where pretending to be retired from all Buſineſs, anſwered, that he had reſigned the whole Government into the Hands of his Son <hi>Ali,</hi> as he had already teſtified by Publick Acts: that he was but a Subject, and a Souldier under his Son, and therefore to him they ought to make their Applications. <hi>Facar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> had at that time an Army of twenty five thouſand Men, the which he divided into two Bodies, commanded by his two Sons. <hi>Ali</hi> his eldeſt he ordered with twelve thouſand Men (a thouſand of which were Maronites, and two thouſand Druzes) to march to <hi>Saphet</hi> for hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the conjunction of the Emirs of <hi>Feruc</hi> and <hi>Therabith,</hi> and the Paſha's of <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> whoſe Forces being joined together, did not compoſe a greater Number than that of <hi>Facar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ali</hi> entercountring with them, and being a brisk and hot-metled Prince, engaged and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them ſo whom, that he defeated them, and killed eight thouſand of their Men; but ſuch a Victory as this not coſting him leſs than ſeven thouſand of his Men, was in effect his own Overthrow; for being the next day charged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Enemy, both ſides fought with that obſtinacy,<note place="margin">The Son of <hi>Facardin</hi> overthrown</note> that (as is reproted) there remained not above an hundred forty ſix of all the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which followed <hi>Ali;</hi> and he himſelf ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Horſe mortally wounded under him, and being out of Breath, Weary, and Faint, yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to a common Souldier, who promiſed him Quarter; but afterwards having him in his power, he ſtrangled him with his Match, and cut off his Head and his little Finger on which he wore his Seal-Ring,<note place="margin">And is ſtrangled.</note> and ſo preſented both to the Paſha. But this proud Conquerour refuſed to accept this Preſent without Ceremony, until firſt the head had been perfumed with Sweet Waters, the Beard combed out, and covered with a rich Turbant, and having kept this Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy for ſome days by him, he ſent it afterwards to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before the News of this Defeat reached the Ears of old <hi>Facardin,</hi> the Captain-Paſha with his Fleet of Gallies arrived at the Port of <hi>Tripoli;</hi> to whom <hi>Facardin</hi> being deſirous to ſhew all Friendſhip, and profeſs Loyalty to the Grand Signior, he cauſed his Army to retire into the Parts of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> whilſt he himſelf, with about three thouſand Men, between Domeſtick Servants and his Guards, went to <hi>Seida,</hi> from whence he ſent two<note n="*" place="margin">A ſort of Veſſel or Ship ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Turks.</note> 
                     <hi>Caramoſauis</hi> laden with Proviſions and Refreſhment to the Captain-Paſha for a Preſent, aſſuring him, that he was an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Vaſſal to the Grand Signior, and was ready to obey all his Commands; and becauſe the Sultan may probably have received ſiniſter Reports rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Arms he had taken up, he aſſured him, that they were no otherwiſe deſigned, than to ſuppreſs the Robberies of the Arabs, and the Incurſions of their Kings; and that he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to conduct his Army to any Place, where his Maſter the Grand Signior ſhould think fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. But theſe fair words could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Captain-Paſha from his Reſolution to enter the Port of <hi>Seida,</hi> nor from his Inſtructions of demanding, and upon refuſal of forcing poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the Caſtle; which as it was the moſt conſiderable Fortreſs, and the moſt pleaſant Seat of all his Dominions, ſo he could not, without much regret and ſorrow, hearken to ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: wherefore that the Paſha might not perſiſt in this Demand, he ſecretly proffered him an hundred thouſand Zechins as a Bribe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Son <hi>Manſour</hi> to be carried for a Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtage and Earneſt of his Faithfulneſs to the Grand Signior. The Captain-Paſha liked well the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Zechins and the Hoſtages, but ſtill required the Surrender of the Caſtle with them; on which whilſt <hi>Facardin</hi> deliberated, News came of the Death of his Son <hi>Ali,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Army, with which, loſing all Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, he yielded his Caſtle of <hi>Seida</hi> to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha, retiring himſelf to his City of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rut:</hi> nor could he reſt quietly at that Place; for being purſued, he was forced to quit it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire with his Maronites and Druzes into the Mountains, leſt being incloſed within the Walls of a City, he ſhould fall alive into the Hands of his Enemies.</p>
                  <p>And now all good Fortune forſaking unhappy <hi>Facardin,</hi> the Maronites and Druzes his Subjects revolt to the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> his Palaces of Gardens of Pleaſure were all ruined, his Friends forſook him, his two remaining Sons were loſt, one carried to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for a Hoſtage, and the other ſlain in Fight; his Towns of <hi>Gazir, Saphet,</hi> St. <hi>John d' Acria,</hi> and others were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> only ſome few ſtrong Places in the Mountains remained to him, where living in League with <hi>Reba</hi> a King of the Arabs, he committed all the Spoils he was able on the Lands belonging to the Paſha of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus.</hi> But being hunted from one Mountain to another, and from one Cave to another, he was at length forced to ſurrender upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he ſhould have liberty to proceed unto
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39539:14"/>the Grand Signior with his own Equipage of three hundred Men, and Trumpets ſounding, and that he might carry with him all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſiſting of a Million of Zechins all in Gold, together with other Riches, which were carried by fourteen Camels; and that he ſhould not be conducted as a Priſoner in Triumph, but that he ſhould with freedom approach the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sultan, like other Paſha's, who are in Grace and Favour.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Propoſals being granted, <hi>Facardin</hi> with his two young Sons began his Journey to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and being about two days journey from thence, he diſpatched eight Cheſts of Gold before him, to prepare and make his way to the Grand Signior; who being pleaſed with the Gold, and greatly rejoyced to receive the Submiſſion and Homage of one who had ſo long ſtood out in Rebellion, he went out in a Diſguiſe and Habit of a Paſha to ſee and diſcourſe with that Perſon, of whom there had been ſo general a Rumor: and having accordingly encountred with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir, he ſate down in his Tent with him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to relate the Story of his Life, with the ſeveral Particulars of his late Misfortunes. Emir <hi>Facardin</hi> well knew the Perſon of the Grand Signior; but feigning as if he was unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with whom he diſcourſed, and that he took him for ſome Paſha, began to recount the Courſe of his Life, the Reaſons why his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies falſely ſuggeſted evil Reports of him to the Grand Signior; how he was forced, for defence of his Life, to take up Arms, and what ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs accompanied his Affairs; all which he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with ſuch Quickneſs and Eloquence, that the Grand Signior pitying his Misfortunes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be his Advocate, and mediate with the Grand Signior in his behalf.</p>
                  <p>The day following <hi>Facardin</hi> made his Entry in a Triumphant manner, and received a moſt favourable Audience from the Grand Signior; and all the Paſha's and great Men in conformity to their Maſter, and in hopes of ſharing ſome part of his Gold, ſhewed him a like kind favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Countenance and Aſpect.</p>
                  <p>But finding afterwards that <hi>Facardin</hi> increaſed daily in the eſteem of the Grand Signior, and that the old Rebel was become a new Favourite, and that he was likely to over-top and out them, they generally conſpired together, taking the Mufti on their ſide, to accuſe him of many Crimes, and more particularly that he was a Chriſtian, and an Apoſtate from the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Faith. This Point of Religion ſo ſenſibly touched the Grand Signior, that he reſolved to condemn him in a manner Solemn and Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; for mounting one Day on his Throne, he commanded <hi>Facardin</hi> to be brought in, and placed on a low Chair; where ordering his Crimes whereof he was accuſed to be recited, he paſſed a formal Sentence of Death upon him: but <hi>Facardin</hi> ariſing to juſtifie himſelf, was not permitted to ſpeak, only he obtained a quarter of an hours reprieve to make his Prayers, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was ſtrangled by the hands of two Mutes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morat</hi> growing now into Years, took into his own Hands the Reins of Government, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to rule Singly and Abſolutely, and to make himſelf rather Feared than Beloved: He degraded four Viziers at once, and baniſhed them into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> confiſcating their Eſtates, for no other Reaſon, than becauſe they had denied him the uſe of their Mules and Camels on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Service.</p>
                  <p>He became extremely ſevere againſt the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, cruſhing them with all imaginable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on the leaſt appearance of Reluctancy to his Commands; declaring,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morat</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Acts of Tyranny.</note> That he expected Blind and Silent Obedience from all, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from his Souldiery.</p>
                  <p>He impoſed a great Tax upon Copper; and becauſe he had ſeveral Warthouſes filled with that Mettal, which had for many Years lain by, he forced the People to buy it at his own Rates. At which Aggrievance the Commonalty grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſperate, began to Mutiny and Rebel; but <hi>Morat</hi> put a ſpeedy ſtop thereunto, by cutting off the Heads of fifty of the moſt Seditious, and ſo paſſed to <hi>Pruſa,</hi> with the Attendance of ſix Gallies.</p>
                  <p>He cauſed a Kadi to be hanged, to the great Diſpleaſure and univerſal Reſentment of the Ulemah, who are Students in the Law; who to make known their Aggrievance, and Conſult a a Remedy, aſſembled in great Numbers at the Houſe of the Mufti.</p>
                  <p>The Queen-Mother being acquainted with this Meeting, and fearing the ill Conſequences thereof, gave immediate Advice to the Sultan; who with like Expedition diſpatched a Boat to bring over the Mufti and his Son to <hi>Pruſa;</hi> who were no ſooner arrived, than they were ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not being permitted to ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to alledge any Plea or Excuſe for their Lives.

It was the common Cuſtom of the Grand Signior to walk the Streets in diſguiſe; when meeting with any drunken Perſon, he would impriſon him, and almoſt drub him to Death. It was his fortune to meet a Deaf Man one day in the Streets; who not hearing the Noiſe of the People, nor the Rumor of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, did not ſo readily ſhift out of the way, as was conſiſtent with the fear and dread of ſo aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Emperor, for which default he was ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led immediately, and his Body thrown into the Streets.</p>
                  <p>All People feared and trembled at theſe Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, and were as careful to look out abroad for the Grand Signior, leſt they ſhould be ſurpriſed with the bluſter of his preſence, as Mariners are of being taken unprovided by ſome ſudden Guſt or Hurricane; for there was ſcarce a Day, that one Innocent or other was not ſacrificed to his Fury and tyrannical Fancy.</p>

                  <p>One <hi>Thomas Zanetti,</hi> a Venetian Merchant, who had built a lofty Jardac, or a high Room of Proſpective on the top of his Houſe, was accuſed to the Grand Signior to have deſigned that Place for no other end, than that he might with a long Glaſs overſee the Chambers of the Ladies, and the Gardens,<note place="margin">Hangs a Venetian Merchant.</note> and Walks of the Seraglio: For which Reaſon, without farther inquiry, he was hanged in his Shirt on the top of his Jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dac, with a red Streamer in his Hand, that ſo the Grand Signior might be ſure that the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was executed. The Eſtate of <hi>Zanetti,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belonging to himſelf or Principals, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated; but in regard the Goods, for ſecurity, were privately conveyed to the Ware-houſes of ſeveral Frank Merchants, ſtrict ſearch was made for them; but in regard the Marks and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were altered, they could not be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: wherefore the Graud Signior concluding, that all the Frank Merchants had combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to deceive him, he Impriſoned every Man of them; nor would he releaſe them, until they had paid forty thouſand Dollars for their Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and Liberty.</p>
                  <p>After which, upon pretence of a Plot, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Franks to defend themſelves from the leviation of this Tax, the Turks ſearched their Houſes for Arms; in taking of which they were ſo rigorous, that they ſpared not ſo much as a Birding-piece; nor yet the Sword of Sir <hi>Peter Wych,</hi> then Ambaſſador for <hi>England,</hi> though he alledged, that it was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sword with which his Majeſty and conferred the Honour of Knighthood upon him.</p>
                  <p>But from theſe Tranſactions at Home, let us paſs to the Wars in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Perſia.</hi> That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Princes, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> had gained ſuch good Succeſs againſt the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> that the Czar was forced to demand Aſſiſtance from the Turks. The Grand Signior, though he had lately made a Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſworn to maintain the Articles of <hi>Chocin,</hi> concluded by his Predeceſſor Sultan <hi>Oſman;</hi> yet the continual Depredations which the Coſſacks made, did always adminiſter reaſonable Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for a War: To which <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> one of his chief Counſellors, a valiant and preſumptuous Captain, did much incite him; for promiſing to himſelf the Conduct of that Army deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Poland,</hi> did much flatter the Sultan and himſelf with the Fancy of mighty Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The War being thus reſolved upon,<note place="margin">The Turks make War on the Poles.</note> the Turk, who commonly ſtrikes before he Quarrels, gave Orders to <hi>Abaſſa</hi> to make Levies of Men in <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia</hi> and <hi>Valachia;</hi> and to put the Tartars in Arms, and the Militia of <hi>Buda,</hi> and of the Parts along the <hi>Danube</hi> into a warlike Poſture, and with all Expedition to enter <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abaſſa</hi> who had with wonderful diligence put his Troops in readineſs, ordered the Tartars, with a Body of fifteen thouſand Men to enter <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which they performed with ſuch celerity, that paſſing the River of <hi>Tyre</hi> above <hi>Chocin</hi> and <hi>Rinczug,</hi> they in a few hours laid waſte for the ſpace of ten Leagues round <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> and ſo retired with their Booty into <hi>Moldavia:</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their haſte was not attended with ſuch good ſpeed, but that they were overtaken on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> by <hi>Staniſlaus Koniſpolzki,</hi> General of the Poliſh Army, with no greater Force than two thouſand five hundred Horſe; howſoever ſurpriſing them whilſt they were feeding their Horſes, he put them into ſuch Confuſion and Diſorder, that he eaſily recovered all their Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and took five of their chief Men Priſoners; of which the Son-in-Law of the <hi>Cantemir</hi> was one. But this was a faint Refreſhment in reſpect to that terrible Storm of ſixty thouſand Men, compoſed of Turks, Tartars, Moldavians and Valachians; which under the Command of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſa</hi> had already paſſed the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Koniſpolzki</hi> the Poliſh General, having not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Force to oppoſe them in open Field, nor time to aſſemble a greater Army, gathered what Supplies he could from the Coſſacks and Lords of that Country, and therewith encamped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon a Hill between the River <hi>Tyr</hi> and the Town of <hi>Chocin,</hi> that he might be the better able to ſuccour <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> which the Enemy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to aſſault.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abaſſa</hi> who contemned this weak Force of the Poles, reſolved, without farther conſideration,<note place="margin">A Fight between the Turks and the Poles.</note> to attack them in their own Camp, and force them to fight; of which the Poles being well adviſed, placed ſeveral Pieces of Artillery, and lined all the Hedges and Ditches with Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, where the Turks were neceſſarily to paſs, drawing out their whole Army into Batalia; the Turks who haſtened the neareſt way to charge the Enemy, fell into the Ambuſh, where having loſt about five hundred Men, they began to make a ſtand, and to conſider of ſome more advantageous way to their Deſign. Wherefore <hi>Abaſſa</hi> taking another Courſe, which he judged to be free from all concealed Dangers, ordered the Tartars to charge the Right Wing, and the Moldavians and Valachians the left of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and he with his Turks would fight the main Body. The Tartars with great Reſolution per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their part, and had wholly defeated that Wing, had not <hi>Wiſnovitzki,</hi> with ſome Troops and a Train of ſmall Artillery, come in ſeaſonably to their Succour: The Moldavians and Valachians fought to faintly againſt the Enemy, whom they conſidered to be Chriſtians, Brothers, and Neighbours, that they ſoon turned their Backs and fled, but were not far purſued by the Poles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abaſſa</hi> receiving this Repulſe, ſounded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and immediately repaſſed the River <hi>Tyr,</hi> and marched with all the haſte he was able, ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping no where, until he arrived at <hi>Rinzur,</hi> about thirty Engliſh miles from the place of the Fight; and arriving at length on the Banks of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> he gave Licenſe to his Souldiers to diſperſe into their Winter-Quarters; in the mean time <hi>Abaſſa</hi> diſpatched Advice to the Grand Signior of the Particulars of the Fight, and of his great Victory, by an entire defeat of the Poliſh Army. The Grand Signior believed the Report, which none durſt to contradict, and which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Rumour of an Ambaſſador com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">An Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador ſent to the G. Signior ſrom <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>About that time that the Ambaſſador ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached near to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior had another Son born, but of a weakly and ſickly Temperament, howſoever great Joy was expreſſed, and all the City was enlightned with Torches, Bonefires, and Fire-works; and that the Grand-Signior might evidence his Greatneſs and Magnificence to the Ambaſſador, he took this Occaſion of the Birth of a Son, to make a ſolemn Entrance into the City, and to make
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39539:15"/>the greater Show, he armed all the Citizens and Inhabitans.</p>
                  <p>Before the Grand Signior would grant Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Ambaſſador, he ordered that <hi>Abaſſa</hi> ſhould treat with him, and underſtand his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deſires. <hi>Abaſſa</hi> carried himſelf high in the Negotiation, he pretended the Damages and Charges of the War, the Demoliſhment of certain Palancas, which were the Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for the Coſſacks; and the Tribute of ten Years paſt, with Security of paiment for the Time to come. The Ambaſſador poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hearken unto any Terms about Tribute; and that for other Matters, the Preſents which he had brought to the Grand Signior, would reaſonably anſwer.</p>
                  <p>His Preſents were,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>A Coach lined with Velvet, with ſix very fine Horſes.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p>Being at length admitted to Audience, and thereunto conducted by the Aga of the Spahees, and the Chaous Baſhee: The Grand Signior asked the Ambaſſador, which was not uſual, <hi>For what Reaſon he was come thither?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which he anſwered; <hi>That he was come to bring his Majeſty Advice of the Coronation of his King; and to eſtabliſh a Peace, is his Majeſty ſhould judg fit to accept thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which the Sultan replied; <hi>That all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Kings ought either to receive the Ottoman Laws, or pay him Tribute, or try the ſharpneſs of his Sword.</hi> And taking a Cemiter in his hand which hung by him, he drew it half out, and ſaid; <hi>With this I will ſubdue my Enemies; and though take another in</hi> Poland.</p>
                  <p>To which the Ambaſſador returning a modeſt Anſwer, was diſmiſſed of the Royal Preſence.</p>
                  <p>And now the Grand Signior, to put a good face on the Buſineſs, and to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that he deſigned what he ſpake, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a War with <hi>Poland,</hi> and ordered his Tents to be carried abroad, ſuppoſing hereby to draw the Poles to his own Terms of Agreement. And in purſuance hereof he mounted on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and rode in ſtate through the City, his upper Veſt was made after the Hungarian Faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lined with Sables; in his right hand he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a Quiver of Arrows, in his left two drawn Swords, on his Turbant he wore a large Plume of Feathers, encompaſſed with a Circle of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds; and in this manner entring his Tents, he proceeded to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> But before his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the Count <hi>Puchen,</hi> Ambaſſador from the Emperor, arrived with other ſumptuous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, offering Incenſe and Gifts of Peace at the Throne of this Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>But before we relate the Tranſactions at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and the Succeſs of Affairs at that Place, let us recount ſeveral diſmal Accidents at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior returning by Sea from a place called <hi>Stravoſta</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Iſmit,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently the Bay of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> where he had for ſome time held his Court and great Divan, he was followed by ſeveral Veſſels appointed to tranſport the People;<note place="margin">The ſeveral Miſchiefs by Water and Fire.</note> in one whereof were nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five Perſons embarked, all of them Paſha's, Aga's, and chief Officers of the Court; the Veſſel was over-ſet by a ſudden guſt of Wind, and all the People drowned excepting three Sea-men which ſaved themſelves by ſwimming. More conſiderable were the Miſchiefs by Fire; For on occaſion of ſome Fire-works made in one of the Grand Siguior's Chiosks, or Houſes of Pleaſure, the Fire took ſo fiercely on the Tavan,<note place="margin">A terrible Fire at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
                     </note> or wooden Works of the Sieling, that it endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the whole Palace, and had conſumed all, but that many Hands and active Men gave a ſtop to the farther Progreſs.</p>
                  <p>This Fire was but a fore-ruuner of a greater, which began the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> in that part of the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which is called <hi>Aia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cab,</hi> being between the Wall and the Port, where live Taverners, Butchers, Fiſhmongers, and others who ſell Proviſions. The Fire took firſt in one of thoſe Houſes which had been a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and are Buildings only made of Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards and Timber; which combuſtible Matter the Houſes round, and was ſo quick in its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as if it had taken by a Train, or that ſome wicked People with Fire-balls had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themſelves in the Miſchief; the Fire took its Courſe againſt the Wind, burning on one ſide and the other to the Hiſtorical Pillar, and to the Moſchs of Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and Sultan <hi>Selim;</hi> ſo that in a ſhort time one third of the City was reduced to Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to expreſs the lamentable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction was made hereby, what Riches, what Palaces, and Moveables were conſumed in it, there being twenty thouſand Houſes reported to be burnt; which Miſery is beſt repreſented by the remembrance of our calamitous Incendiation at <hi>London;</hi> the greateſt difference between one and the other was, that that at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was more quick in its Motion; for it burnt a larger compaſs of Ground in one third of the Time, than ours did at <hi>London;</hi> for that City for the moſt part conſiſting of ſlight Buildings of Wood, met not the reſiſtance which ours ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did againſt the Walls of Brick and Stones.</p>
                  <p>The Fire being extinguiſhed, and Men having time to lament and think, bagan to impute the Cauſe and Fault to thoſe whom they moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; ſometimes they accuſed the Perſians for having fired the City, for which Crime one of them the next Year ſuffered Death. Some at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the Cauſe of all to the Janiſaries; and that they, out of hatred to the Inhabitants, or for the ſake of Plunder, if they did not begin, yet at leaſt increaſed the Fire; which they the more ſuſpected, becauſe the Janiſaries refuſed not only to work themſelves, alledging, that they expected Orders from their Aga, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hindered and diſcouraged others. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Grand Signior not wanting on his own part to contribute all Aſſiſtance poſſible, ſent four thouſand Men out of his Seraglio to work about the Fire, not excuſing the very Officers of his Royal Chamber from contributing their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and perſonal Aid; ſome of which ventured far into the Fire, to demonſtrate their Courage, Activeneſs, and Obedience to the Commands of their Emperor: but all this was too little againſt an obſtinate and an invincible Enemy, for the Fire flamed, and proceeded, until it wanted Nouriſhment and Food to conſume.</p>
                  <p>In fine, twenty thouſand Houſes were burnt, two hundred Moſchs, and the Library of the Mufti, which for the Number of the Arabick and Perſian Books, was curious, and of high eſteem. The Albengs, or Habitation of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39539:16"/>Janiſaries containing three hundred Chambers, of which each Chamber was capable to receive four hundred Men, were all burnt and reduced to Aſhes.</p>
                  <p>The which fatal and miſerable Spectacle, did a little touch the Heart of Sultan <hi>Morat;</hi> ſo that he gave out conſiderable Sums to comfort the Diſtreſſed, who had moſt ſuffered by this Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and to raiſe from its Aſhes his conſumed and languiſhing <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and flouriſhing, was again miſerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by Flames, in the Month of <hi>April</hi> 1660. But ſuch is the beneficial and commodious ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Place, and the Riches thereof by Trade, and the Preſence of the Ottoman Court, that the Inhabitants again rebuilt it in fewer Years than could be imagined.</p>
                  <p>But now to return to the Grand Signior at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> we find him reſolutely deſigned to make a War upon <hi>Poland,</hi> to whcih he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Perſwaſions of <hi>Abaſſa,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons for a War with <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </note> and the preſent conjuncture of Advantage to join with the Moſcovite, it ſeeming great Policy not to ſuffer the Countries of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> to be over-run; or the Poles, who is a warlike and dangerous Nation, to grow Puiſſant and Powerful by his Succeſs and Conqueſt over his Neighbours: Wherefore Preparations were made on all ſides for the War; great Quantities of Proviſions and Ammunition were ſent into <hi>Moldavia</hi> by way of the Black Sea and the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Tartar <hi>Han</hi> ſent word that all his Forces were in readineſs, and expected nothing but their Orders to march. The Beglerbey of <hi>Greece</hi> made his Rendezvous at <hi>Philippolis</hi> with an Army of thirty thouſand Men, where he attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to join with the Forces of <hi>Boſna, Siliſtria,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe. Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Walachia</hi> made an appearance of Levying Men, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Turk; but thier Hearts were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Poles, with whom they kept a ſceret correſpondence, and would be ready to adhere on the leaſt on the leaſt Opportunity.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the Army of the Turks was ſo great, and all his Affairs in that readineſs, that he ſcorned to incline an Ear to Propoſitions of Peace; in which Opinion <hi>Abaſſa</hi> humoured and perſwaded him, that the Poles were ſo fearful of his Forces, that they had already yielded to Terms of compounding for a yearly Tribute. All which proved falſe; for in the mean time <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> remitting nothing of the Heat and Vigour of his War againſt the Moſcovites, he was ſo ſuccesful therein, that he foced an Army of eighty thouſand Men, which he had beſieged in their Camp,<note place="margin">The Victory which the Poles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained over the Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</note> to lay down their Arms, and ſurrender themſelves; which was an Action ſcarce to be credited, at leaſt to be parallel'd in any Hiſtory; and with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he might have proceeded to the Capital City of <hi>Moſco,</hi> and concluded the War and that Empire: But God's Provdence, which governs all things, altered this Counſel, and diverted thoſe victorious Arms to the Siege of <hi>Bial;</hi> which Town being well fortified and gariſoned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood many Aſſaults of the Enemy, and blunted the Spirits and Swords of the Conqueror; for loſing much time in this Siege, other Towns made uſe of the Opportunity to provide and fortify themſelves; whilſt the Poles growing weary, and wanting Pay, raiſed divers Mutinies and Seditions in the Camp. Theſe Difficulties and Inconveniences inclined the King <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> to bend a favourable Ear to the many Supplications and Inſtances which the Moſcovites made for Peace: So that the Plenipotentiaries being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, it was agreed, that the Dutchy of <hi>Smoleſco</hi> and <hi>Czernieſchou,</hi> which two hundred Years paſt had been taken from <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Litua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

                  <p>The News of this ſudden Peace coming unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly to Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> cauſed his Bravadoes againſt <hi>Poland</hi> to ceaſe, and to turn the ſtile of his Fury and Indignation againſt the Moſcovites, whom he vilified with all imaginable Terms of Perſidiouſneſs and Cowardiſe, and abuſed and impriſoned their Ambaſſadors. He conſidered that he had provoked an Enemy who was Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, Valiant, and Powerful, and one who at any time was able to contend with his united Force, much more whilſt it was ſeparated and diſjoined by his War in <hi>Perſia:</hi> wherefore in all haſte he diſpatched an Ambaſſador into <hi>Poland,</hi>

This Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor found the King at the Diet in <hi>Waſaw,</hi> where he publickly endeavoured to excuſe his Maſter for the late Acts of Hoſtility; aſſuring them, that they were not performed according to his Maſter's Deſires, and Original Intentions, but as they were moved and guided by the evil Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and Artifices of <hi>Abaſſa,</hi> who being ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly culpable of this Fault, by giving ill Counſels to his Maſter, he aſſured them, in the Name of the Sultan, that he ſhould receive ſuch Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as they ſhould think fit to inflict upon him. Hereupon the King <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> gave this Anſwer, That ſince the Grand Signior could ſo eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the Articles of that Peace which had been ſolemnly and ſacredly eſtabliſhed, it was now his Part, and the Wiſdom of that grave Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, to contrive ſuch Conditions and Bonds wherewith to oblige his Maſter, as could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and at his Pleaſure be broken or avoided. And at the ſame time the Poliſh Ambaſſador be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and diſcourſing in the Diet of the Pride and Perfidiouſneſs of the Turks, and the Scorn wherewith they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſtian Ambaſſadors, ſo incenſed the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the whole Aſſembly, that with a genersl Conſent they approved the words of the King, adding, That they would, no longer be ſubject to the Inſults and Falſities of that Tyrant, whom they would make to know, that they wore as well Offenſive as Defenſive Arms; and were not of that abject Spirit, or mean Condition, to permit the Sultan to violate the moſt Sacred Articles of Peace, and then at his pleaſure to ſalve them with a fawning Acknowledgment, or a flattering Speech. In this manner the Turkiſh Ambaſſador was returned, whilſt the King <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> went into <hi>Podolia</hi> to take a view of his Armies; which he found to conſiſt of eighty thouſand fighting Men, all well accoutred, of good Courage, and ready to follow their King to the Walls of <hi>Conſtaninople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fear of the Motion of this great Army, in a Conjuncture when the Wars broken out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in <hi>Perſia</hi> were not proſperous, affected the Mind of <hi>Morat</hi> which much terror; ſo that he became very ſollicitous to find out, and make ſome ſubſtantial Propoſition in order to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation.

                     <hi>Abaſſa</hi> was ſtrangled by two Kapugees, and given for a Sacrifice to appeaſe the Anger of his Enemies; a Perſon who was a

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Poles not being pacified with this ſingle Act of Penitence, but thirſting farther after the Blood of the Turks, deſired to Spoil and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage their Richer Provinces. Howſoever at length the Council of <hi>Poland</hi> entring into more ſerious Debates, conſidered, that the Troops lately come from <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> were but in a bad condition; that the part of their Army, which conſiſted of Voluntiers, would not endure a long and tediuos War; and that the Expence and Charge of this great Army was immenſe and almoſt inſupportable: for which Reaſons it was reſolved, that a Peace ſhould be made, which was ſoon afterwards concluded, and agreed on theſe following Articles.</p>

                  <p>That the Poles ſhall ſuppreſs all Acts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility of the Coſſacks in the Black Sea.</p>
                  <p>That the Turks renounce for ever all Demands, or future pretence of Tribute from <hi>Poland:</hi> and that they ſhall build no new Forts on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</p>

                  <p>In this Year happened out great Differences between the French Ambaſſador and the Turkiſh Officers.<note place="margin">A Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador &amp; the Captain Paſha.</note> The firſt Diſguſt had its Original from the Year 1631, when the Marqueſs of <hi>Marcheville</hi> going Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was in his Voyage met off of <hi>Scio</hi> by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha and his Fleet of Gallies, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent off a Boat to adviſe him, that he ſhould ſtrike his Flag, and make ready the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents which were due to the Grand Signior's Admiral. <hi>Marcheville</hi> duly conſidering, that this Submiſſion would blemiſh the Honour of his Maſter, and the Dignity of his Character, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Compliance either in one or the other; howſoever that he might teſtify the Friendſhip and good Correſpondence which he came to confirm between the two Kings, he ſtood off at ſome diſtance, and fired five Guns to ſalute the Grand Signior's Standard: But the Captain-Paſha not contenting himſelf herewith, required the Ambaſſador to come aboard and ſpeak with him; which after divers Meſſages from one Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel to another, the Ambaſſador was counſelled to perform, not knowing how far otherwiſe he might engage the Honour of his Maſter. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheville</hi> being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of the Affront and Violence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Captain-Paſha; which though the Grand Signior and other Miniſters ſeemed not to approve, yet the Ambaſſadour received little other ſatisfaction than fair Words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, that his Honour ſhould be again repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p>At the Arrival of the Sieur <hi>Marcheville,</hi> the Count <hi>Ceſi,</hi> who was the former Ambaſſador, was to return into <hi>France;</hi> but the Debts which he had contracted by a certain way of living, were ſo great, that the Creditors would not ſuffer him to depart without paiment; for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of which, he endured many Affronts of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his own Perſon, and was detained at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> until this Year 1634; during which time the Marqueſ, <hi>Marcheville</hi> managed all the Affairs of the Embaſſy; who keeping ſtill in mind the Affront offered him before <hi>Scio,</hi> watched all Opportunities to diſparage the Actions and Perſon of the Captain-Paſha; who at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from the Black Sea, where he had ſome Succeſs againſt the Coſſacks, was graciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Grand Signior; and being adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, how, during his abſence, the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador had endeavoured to blaſt his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by many Inſtances of Diminution, which he often inculcated by his Druggerman, took Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Grand Signior's good Humor, to vent before him the reſentment which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thereof: The Grand Signior, to gratify the Paſha, promiſed to hang the Druggerman; which the Paſha acknowledged as a ſingular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and returned from the Preſence of the Sultan full of Joy and Contentment. But better to cover his Malice, and to enſnare the Poor Wretch, he ſent a Meſſenger to the Ambaſſador, aſſuring him that he deſired his Friendſhip; and that there might be a right underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, he perſwaded him to ſend his Druggerman to him, that by his Mouth he might ſignify the eſteem he had for the Ambaſſador, from whoſe Spirits he was willing to take off all Jealouſies and Umbrages of Diſcontent.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador not ſuſpecting the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Paſha,<note place="margin">The French Drugger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hanged</note> ſent his Druggerman to him; hwo being come within his Power, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately hanged by the Grand Signior's expreſs Command, and ordered that he ſhould remain on the Gallows with his Velvet Cap on his Head, which in this Sultan's Reign all Druggermen wore to diſtinguiſh them from others.</p>
                  <p>The Ambaſſador complained greatly of this Affront, nad Violation of Articles, to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam and other Officers, but could receive no other Anſwer or Satisfaction, than that the Grand Signior might execute Juſtice as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on his Subjects, without asking leave, or concerning the King of <hi>France</hi> or his Ambaſſador in the Matter.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Marcheville</hi> not reſting ſatisfied with this Reply, ſtill proſecuted his Pique and Animoſity to ſuch a height, that the Captain-Paſha farther incenſed thereat, obtained Authority form the Grand Signior to diſpatch him away: ſo that ſending one day for <hi>Marcheville,</hi> and firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching his Contrivances and Deſigns againſt him, told him plainly, that it was the Grand Signior's Pleaſure that he ſhould depart at that inſtant; to which he conſtrained the Ambaſſador ſo precipitately, that he would not give him time to advertiſe his Servants,<note place="margin">The Sieur <hi>Marche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                     </note> or make up his Baggage, but forced him aboard a French Ship then in Port, which he immediatly compelled to ſail; and the Wind being contrary, cauſed the Veſſel to be toaed abroad by two Gallies into the open Sea of the <hi>Propontis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the injurious departure of this Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, the Count <hi>Ceſi,</hi> who had been detained at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the Reaſons before denoted, took again upon him the Function of Ambaſſador. To execute which, in better advantage of Trade and Commerce, he was adviſed to a compliance with the Captain-Paſha, and to uſe ſuch Means as might mitigate that Acrimony of Spirit which this Paſha nouriſhed againſt the French Nation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Diſputes between the French and the Turkiſh Officers, revived certain Diſguſts and Averſion againſt all the Frank Nations, which favoured the Latine Rites; ſo that in deſpight
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:39539:17"/>to them, the Grand Signior reſtored again <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> the Patriarch to the Patriarchal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had long been perſecuted by the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, and by their Means been depoſed, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that for the future he ſhould continue undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, in oppoſition to all thoſe of the Roman Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Peace (as we have ſaid) being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Poland,</hi> the Grand Signior was more at Ieiſure to attend the Wars in <hi>Perſia;</hi> with the Labours and Toils of which the Janiſaries being wearied, began new Troubles and Seditions in the Camp; the which Diſorder <hi>Morat</hi> attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the negligence or cowardiſe of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, as wanting Courage to ſuppreſs them, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the Janiſar-Aga to appear before him,<note place="margin">Acts of Cruelty.</note> and without long Proceſs or Excuſe cut off his Head, and confiſcated his Eſtate to the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, which amounted to a Million and ſeventy thouſand Dollars: another Janiſary alſo, more rich than ſeditious, was in like manner ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and an hundred and ſixty thouſand Dollars of his Eſtate added to the Treaſury of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. The Paſha alſo of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with ſeveral other Officers of the Army enriched with Spoils of the People, fell a Sacrifice to <hi>Morat</hi>'s Avarice and Cruelty; to whom Riches and Blood were ſo pleaſing, that none acquired a higher degree of Grace in his Favour, than thoſe who could give him notice of opulent Men, who having found Riches, he undertook to find them Guilty, and to prove their Wealth ſo corrupted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion and violence, that nothing could hallow or purifie it but his Coffers.</p>
                  <p>The next News from <hi>Perſia</hi> brought advice, that that King at the Head of a powerful Army was encamped in the Country about <hi>Van,</hi> with which the Turks not having ſufficient Force to fight, the Vizier wrote to the Grand Signior, that his Preſence was neceſſary to increaſe the Army, and encourage the Souldiery; whereupon he reſolved to leave <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and transfer his Court to his Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The G. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior returns to <hi>Scutari.</hi>
                     </note> that ſo remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Banks of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he might be nearer to his Buſineſs, both to receive Intelligence, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Supplies; and becauſe Seditions and Diſcontents in the People do always obſtruct the Motion of Publick-Affairs, he not only ruined the Taverns and Tabacco-ſhops, but forbid Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and other idle Places of Concourſe; nay to Barbers Shops no more than one was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enter at a time; for thoſe being places of reſort, Treaſon was frequently vented there, Men of that Profeſſion being notorious through the World for their Talk and Intemperance of Language: And farther, to reſtrain Meetings and ſecret Conventions, ſtrict Orders were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that after an hour and half in the Night, all Fires and Candles in the City ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, which was the general Diſcontent of all People.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhewed much of the fierce Spirit of the Sultan, was a certain Fury which he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on this occaſion. On a certain day, riding on his Horſe, thirty Indian Pilgrims met him in the way to demand his Charity, and being in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent habit to what the Turks wear, and not accuſtomary in that Country, the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Horſe ſtarted at the ſight of them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpurred for bogling in that manner, the Horſe capred and reared an end, ſo that he threw his Rider; at which the Grand Signior being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enraged, drew out his Cemiter, and with his own hand killed his Horſe, and inſtead of Alms, prepared a place of Entertainment in the Gallies for thoſe unhappy Indians.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior being returned to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at <hi>Scutari,</hi> which is ſeated on the Aſian ſide oppoſite to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The G.

The Officers of the Army contended to out-vy each the other in their Preſents to the Grand Signior, ſome furniſhed him with Royal Tents, others with curious and light Arms; and others with Horſes and Furnitures of value. Great Sums of Mony were extracted out of the Exchequer for Military Preparations and Paiments of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. The Charge of Affairs, in abſence of the Grand Signior, was committed to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtangi-baſhee, who was made Chimacam of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> and ſo with a fierce Spirit, and aſpect full of Indignation and Anger, he mounted his Horſe at the Head of an Army of an hundred thouſand; he departed from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> about the end of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we recount the particulars of what ſucceeded in <hi>Perſia,</hi> it is requiſite to caſt our Thoughts back to the Troubles of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> occaſioned by the competition of <hi>Stephen Bethlem</hi> and <hi>George Ragotski,</hi> for that Principality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bethlem</hi> (as we have ſaid before) being grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and diſcontented at his hard Fortune in being put by the Government,<note place="margin">

                     <q>That for this Reaſon only, in diſhonour and deſpight to the Ottoman Empire, he was excluded from the Government, and therefore challenged its Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to re-eſtabliſh him therein; in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, he promiſed the ſame Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Devotion to the Sultan, which was profeſſed and maintained by his Anceſtors, and was natural to the Family of <hi>Gabor.</hi> That as to <hi>Ragotski</hi> it was apparent, that he entertained different Principles; that he was a Perſon of elated Thoughts, and a Turbulent Spirit, and was ever united in Combination with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, Germans, and other Enemies to the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks moved with theſe Reaſons, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to favour <hi>Stephen,</hi> and to diſcountenance <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski;</hi> and though the Conjuncture of Affairs was ſuch, as that any other Engagement in War, beſides that of <hi>Perſia,</hi> did not ſquare with the preſent Deſigns; yet at all times it was judged convenient to ſow the Tares of Diſcord, and promote Differences amongſt Chriſtians, which have ever produced Advantages to the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Cauſe. And likewiſe the Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> was commanded to enter <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> with a Force ſufficient to contend with <hi>Ragotski;</hi> and leſt the Emperor ſhould be allarm'd with this Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Chiaus was diſpatched to give him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect underſtanding of the Reaſons, why an Army marched into <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi>

                  <p>The Hungarians ſeconded thoſe Inſtances which <hi>Ragotski</hi> had made at the Imperial Court, and the Party which he had made at <hi>Vienna</hi> brought the matter to a debate in Council, which was argued on both ſides with ſolid and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Reaſons. Thoſe who ſpake in disfavour of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> alledged, That all Aſſiſtance contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him would be a juſt Cauſe and Pretence to the Grand Signior to make War with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.

Let us therefore conſider, which agrees beſt with the Security of the Empire; that</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania <hi>ſhould remain in the Hands of</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski, <hi>or of the Turk; or that we had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtrike againſt the Rock of Jealouſie, which we conceive againſt this Tranſylvanian, or on that ruinous Rock of the Turkiſh Power. The Ottoman Councils commonly look aſquint, they caſt their Eye on the Prince, when their ſight aims at the Principality; and threaten the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when they deſign to vent their Fury to the ſubjection of his Country. The true Intent of the Turk is to reduce</hi> Tranſylvania <hi>to the ſame Condition with</hi> Moldavia <hi>and</hi> Walachia, <hi>and to incorporate this, with infinite other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, into the groſs Body of his Empire. It is notorious to all the World, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, your Predeceſſors, have loſt a large Tract of Land by the Turks; and your Loſſes will every day be greater, as their Conqueſts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: And when their Dominions in</hi> Europe <hi>are ſo enlarged, that they are able to quarter their Aſiatick Cavalry in theſe Countries, your Dangers muſt neceſſarily be inevitable and full of Terror. For I compute, that when the Turk deſigns to make War upon us, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches with an hundred thouſand Men, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ten thouſand Camels, beſides other Beaſts of Burden: ſo numerous a Body as this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be maintained until the Graſs be fully grown, which is not until the middle or end of</hi> June; <hi>and from that time they have more than a month or ſix weeks March before they arrive upon our Confines; the which conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time, prolongs their Enterpriſes, and protracts the time of our Damages. But if once they become Maſters of</hi> Tranſylvania, <hi>and that that Country be laid to</hi> Moldavia, Walachia, <hi>and other parts of</hi> Hungary, <hi>they may then commodiouſly winter amongst us, and begin their Wars and Attempts upon us early in the Year, and purſue them until the laſt ſeaſon of the Autumn: and in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whilſt we are debating and taking our Meaſures in our Diet, they will fatten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſatiate their Appetites with our Spoils. It is good therefore for us to defend</hi> Auſtria <hi>in</hi> Tranſylvania, <hi>keeping the Fever as far from the Heart as we are able. Let us ſuppoſe, that</hi> Ragotski <hi>is the moſt ungrateful Man in the World; and that after we have ſupported and ſuccoured him, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe his Arms upon us: Howſoever he is not ſo ſtrong and conſiderable as to do us much hurt, and therefore it were better to have him our Neighbour and our Enemy, than the Turk, though our Friend; the firſt can only admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſome little cauſe of Jealouſie, but the other may deſtroy and ſupplant us; the firſt is but like a putrid Fever, which is cured with every ſmall Evacuation; but the latter is a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which dilates and diffuſes it ſelf, and is deadly and irrecoverable. Let not the Scruple neither of breaking with the Turk trouble us;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:39539:18"/>for we may adminiſter Aſſiſtance under-hand, and without noiſe effect our Buſineſs, without arriving at the extremity of a Rupture. It is folly and weakneſs in us to be charmed by the Flatteries of the Turks, and the fair words of this Chaous; or to imagine, that when they have over-run all</hi> Tranſylvania, <hi>they will ſtop in the midſt of their Career, before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Gates of</hi> Vienna; <hi>no, their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are to lull us aſleep, and to deſtroy our Neighbour firſt, and then us; they cannot devour us both at once, but husband their Diet, and reſerve us for another Meal. The Turk is like a Serpent, who lies quiet and coiled up all the Winter; not becauſe he wants either a Sting or Poiſon, but being benummed with cold, wants warmth and heat to give it Motion and Operation. This is my Senſe and Opinion, which I moſt humbly tender before the greater Wiſdom of Your Sacred Majeſty.</hi>

                  <p>Hereupon the Turks entred <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> with an Army of twenty five thouſand Men under the Command of the Paſha of <hi>Buda: Ragotski,</hi> to obſtruct their March, diſpatched his General <hi>Cornis</hi> with ſeven thouſand Men, to prepoſſeſs an advantageous Ground, with Order to entertain, but not fight the Enemy, until he could come up to him with the groſs of his Army.</p>
                  <p>The Turks perceiving their advantage in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, reſolved to engage the Enemy before they were reinforced with new Succours; to perform which they made a Detachment of twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe, and two thouſand Janiſaries, and ſome Field Pieces, commanded by the Paſha him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and <hi>Stephen Gabor. Cornis</hi> not being able to diſingage himſelf, or avoid fighting, made a Vertue of Neceſſity, and put his Forces into form of Battel; and exhorting his Men to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example, aſſured them, that Victory was ſooner acquired by Valour than Numbers, and that Fortune was always more favourable to the Valiant and Brave, than to the Cowardly and puſillanimous.</p>

                     </note> ſought in the Head of his Men, and led them through the thickeſt of his Enemies, the firſt rank of which not being able to ſuſtain the furious Charge of the Chriſtians, gave way; and being diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the firſt Squadrons ran foul of the ſecood, and at length all of them betook themſelves to a ſhameful flight.<note place="margin">Are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</note> The Tranſylvanians took all their Canon and Baggage, with ten Enſigns, and killed three thouſand Turks. The Paſha of <hi>Agria</hi> was wounded, and <hi>Olac</hi> Bei of <hi>Temiſwar</hi> was taken Priſoner; and the whole Army had that day been defeated, had not the Janiſaries, who fortified themſelves in a thick Wood, given a ſtop to a farther purſuit. <hi>Ragotski</hi> likewiſe in divers ſucceeding Skirmiſhes overthrew the Turks, killing many Paſha's and Souldiers of Quality, and at length remained ſole Maſter of the Field.</p>
                  <p>The Turks retired to <hi>Lippa,</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> to <hi>Temiſwar,</hi> whilſt <hi>Ragotski</hi> made his Incurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country of the Turks, burning and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two thouſand Villages;<note place="margin">Peace is made.</note> with which being terrified and beaten into terms of Reaſon, they agreed to ſuffer <hi>Ragotski</hi> to injoy his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, conditionally, that the Goods and Eſtate of <hi>Gabor</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> ſhould be reſtored un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: and thus <hi>Ragotski</hi> eſtabliſhed himſelf in the Government, and obtained a Confirmation thereof from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to his Son, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Preſents and Ornaments of a Prince. And this Example ſhews us in what manner we are to deal with Turks; Reſolution and Rigour are better Arms againſt them than Complements; and with an Enemy it is more advantageous to make Peace with Weapons in our Hands, than to condeſcend to the hard Terms which a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant pleaſes to impoſe on an eaſie and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided People.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as this News arrived the Ears of the proud Sultan, he was ſo incenſed, that in a fury he would have deſiſted from his preſent War in <hi>Perſia,</hi> to vent his Revenge upon <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> but the cooler and more moderate Counſels of wiſer Friends, adviſed him to defer the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Anger, until he could diſcharge it more to the purpoſe, and in a Conjuncture when it would fall more eaſy on himſelf, and more heavy on his Enemy: Howſoever in the mean time <hi>Ragotski</hi> made ſuch uſe of this remote Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Ottoman Arms, by advantaging himſelf of an Alliance with the Coſſacks, and by the ill Correſpondence and Diffidence which at that time intervened between the Tartars and the Port, that he not only avoided the Revenge threatned by <hi>Morat,</hi> but obtained an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Inheritance to his Son.</p>
                  <p>By this time Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> was arrived at <hi>Erzrum,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Morat <hi>at</hi> Erzrum.</note> which is a City belonging to the Turks on the Confines of <hi>Perſia;</hi> where the firſt Act which he performed of Juſtice, was to cut off the Head of the Paſha for his Oppreſſion and Extortions inflicted on his People.</p>
                  <p>Entring into <hi>Armenia,</hi> he was grieved to ſee the upper and lower Provinces ſo miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and waſted by the War; to recover which, he commanded the People, under pain of Death, to return again to their Ancient Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations within the ſpace of twenty days; but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39539:18"/>they being ſetled in other Cities, where perhaps they had purchaſed Houſes and Lands, could not poſſibly comply with the Severity of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; and therefore were conſtrained to buy a Diſpenſation and releaſe from the Penalty for a Sum of Mony.</p>
                  <p>About the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> in the parts of <hi>Erzrum, Morat</hi> made a general Review and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of his whole Army; with which thoſe he brought from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> joined to Recruits by the way, and thoſe Forces which had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged War in <hi>Perſia,</hi> amounted to near the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of three hundred thouſand fighting Men, but ſuch as were admirably well diſciplined, not only by the Severity of their Soveraign, but by the example he ſhewed them of Frugality and Patience: for he often marched afoot in the midſt of the Heats;<note place="margin">The Grand Signior's Patience &amp; Labours.</note> he was very temperate in his Diet, though he was naturally of a glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and luxurious Palate: for ſeveral Months he made uſe of no other Pillow for his Head than his Saddle, no other Blanket or Quilt than the Covering or Foot-cloth of his Horſe.</p>
                  <p>Being arrived near to the City of <hi>Revan,</hi> he beſtowed that Largeſs on the Souldiery of a Dollar a Man, which is accuſtomary to be given at all times, when the Grand Signior marches in Perſon, and then made known to them his Intentions of beſieging that Place; and in caſe he took it not in the ſpace of ten days, that then he would leave it begirt with forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men; and dividing his Army into three Bodies, he would enter the Bowels of <hi>Perſia</hi> by divers ways. The Tents of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and of all the Camp, were pitched, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries raiſed, the Trenches opened, and all Matters laid in the formal manner of a Siege. The Gariſon within,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Revan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed and ſurrendred by Emir <hi>Gumir.</hi>
                     </note> commanded by Emir <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir,</hi> conſiſted of fifteen thouſand Men, fitted and provided with all ſorts of Ammunition, and wanted neither Courage nor Proviſions; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever at the end of nine days, the City was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to the Sultan, upon Terms of Quarter to the whole Gariſon, both for Life and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Eſtate: And becauſe this Governour Emir <hi>Gumir,</hi> a principal Noble-man of <hi>Perſia,</hi> had by corruption thus voluntarily delivered up the City, he acquired a place of high Grace and eſteem in the Favour of the Grand Signior; to which his courtly manner of indulging his Humour, and complying with him in his Wine and Feaſts, (to which the joy of this preſent Succeſs priviledged him to return) gave him daily a new Title to receive extraordinary Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours from him.</p>
                  <p>The News of this proſperous Succeſs was poſted to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as the firſt Eſſay of the good Effects of the Sultan's Preſence, and was there celebrated with Feaſts,<note place="margin">Rejoycing and a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtival kept for it at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </note> Joy, and Lights, according to the Turkiſh Faſhion, called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalma;</hi> to perform which, the Turks obliged likewiſe the Chriſtian Ambaſſadors, ſaying, That if they were Friends, they ought to evidence their Satisfaction, by demonſtrations of Joy in the proſperity of their Ally.</p>
                  <p>The Feſtival was kept for the ſpace of four days; during which two Brothers of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, <hi>viz. Bajazet</hi> and <hi>Orchan</hi> were ſtrangled; the latter of which, as is ſaid, was ſo brave, and of that Courage, that he killed four of his Executioners before he ſubmitted his Neck to the fatal Cord.</p>
                  <p>The Turks entring farther into <hi>Perſia,</hi> incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately fell into an Ambuſh, where twelve thouſand of their Men were defeated; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the remainder of the Army not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with this Encounter, proceeded on their March, making moſt miſerable Havock and Deſtruction of all before them,<note place="margin">The Turks enter far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </note> carrying that Dread and Terrour to the Countries round, that all People fled, leaving their Houſes and Things not portable, to the poſſeſſion of the Enemy. Howſoever the Turks found greater Difficulties than they expected; for meeting frequently Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Perſian Cavalry, which were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to manage their Horſe and Sword, were often defeated, at leaſt endured and ſuſtained the ſhock of Bloody Skirmiſhes; and then the Perſians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into the Mountains known to them, but unknown to the Turks, which ſerved them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than fortified Places, returned again when any Advantage or Booty appeared, which perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vexed and wearied the Enemy; and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Things which might afford them relief, rendred that fruitful Country more Deſolate and barren than the Deſarts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> or the Sands of <hi>Arabia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this manner the Turkiſh Army being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all ſorts of Proviſions and Refreſhments, were forced to retire to the Country of <hi>Tauris;</hi> which being haraſſed and impoveriſhed like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces, cauſed a miſerable Famine in the Camp, whereby Multitudes of Horſes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels periſhed for want of Nutriment; at which the Grand Signior being highly incenſed againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Tauris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tauris</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> committed their City to the Will and Mercy of the Souldiery, who having pillaged and ſacked it, leſt it a miſerable ſpectacle of Fire and Sword.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> ſeeing in what manner the Troops of his Enemy were wearied and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, took hold of this Opportunity as ſeaſonable to propoſe certain Articles of Peace by an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, to which <hi>Morat</hi> ſeemed to incline a flexible Ear; but lodging his Souldiers in their Winter-quarters in the parts of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> and <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he took his way towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with intention to eaſe the Hardſhips and Labours of the Summers War, by a voluptuous Eaſe and Winters paſtime in the delights and ſoftneſs of the Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>16th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> he arrived at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> having paſſed from <hi>Iſmit</hi> through the Gulph of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> with the attendance of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies: he made his Entry by the Jews Gate, and not by that of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> as was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary; he was mounted on one of the beſt of his Horſes, and cloathed with a Coat of Mail, a Casket on his Head, with three Feathers ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Pearls and precious Stones; his Sword was girt to his ſide with his Bow and Quiver, his Beard was in a rough and neglected manner, which made him appear more Fierce and Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; the Chimacam came after him, accompanied with the Traitor who ſurrendred <hi>Revan.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Feſtival for return of the G. Signior.</note> This Feſtival for his return was celebrated for the ſpace of a whole week, during which time the Shops were ſhut, the Doors and Outſides ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with green Boughs and Paintings, and by Night the Streets with Torches were made as clear as the day: howſoever the People ſecretly murmured, that the War was not proſecuted, and the Advantages taken, when Fortune began to ſmile and favour their Enterpriſes; and that now deſiſting in the middle way, the Work was again to be begun, and all the foregoing Blood and Treaſure was ſpent and conſumed to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Theſe Murmurings of the People were not without ſome Ground and Cauſe; for after the departure of the Grand Signior, the Perſians put themſelves again into the Field, and recovered the Country which they had loſt; and having
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39539:19"/>offered a Sum of Mony to <hi>Morteſa</hi> Paſha to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Revan;</hi> which he refuſing to accept on Principles of Fidelity and Honour, they prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to lay cloſe Siege to the Place: the Janiſaries were alſo diſpleaſed to ſee themſelves neglected, and caſt out of the Guard, and their Places ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Boſtangees; nor leſs diſguſted were the Lawyers to ſee ſeveral of their Judges and Kadies handged, and their Heads cut off, upon pretence of Sedition and Faction. His ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor more inceaſed to the height of Tyranny, by reaſon of certain twinges which he ſuffered of the Gout, which is not uſual in Perſons of his Age, not ſurpaſſing twenty ſix years; and becauſe his Phyſician, a Jew, forbid him wholly to drink Wine, as poiſon to his Diſeaſe and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, he was ſo enraged, that he drove him from his Preſence with Indignation; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceived ſuch Anger and Prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the whole Nation, that he cauſed their Houſes to be ſearched, and their Jewels taken from them. But what was moſt ſtrange, was his horrid averſion to Tobacco,<note place="margin">His averſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco.</note> the taking of which, by any Perſon whatſoever, he forbid upon pain of Death; which Sentence he ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly executed, that he cauſed the Legs and Arms of two Men, one that ſold Tobacco, and the other that took it, to be ſawed off, and in that manner expoſed to the view of the People: he alſo cauſed two others, a Man and a Woman, to be impaled alive, for the ſame Offence, with a Roll of Tabaco about their Necks.</p>
                  <p>As the Gout cauſed him to be froward and ill-natur'd, ſo more eſpecially when ill news came from <hi>Perſia,</hi> he was obſerved to be more raving and tyrannical than ever.

                  <p>He often walked in the night, puniſhing Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Diſorders of the Streets, and meeting two Women wandring in the dark, he cauſed them to be cut in pieces.</p>
                  <p>He put hi Cook to Death for not dreſſing his Meat well, or not ſeaſoning his Sauces according to his Palate.</p>
                  <p>In his Seraglio ſporting with his Arms, he wounded himſelf with a Dart in the thigh; and by accident wounded the Son of <hi>Mehmet</hi> the late Vizier with a Carbine-ſhot, of which in a ſhort time after he died.</p>
                  <p>The Perſians having taken <hi>Revan</hi> (as we have ſaid) inſtituted Chambers of Janiſaries in that place after the Turkiſh faſhion, paying them in the ſame form as at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and to allure the Spahees to enter into his Service, he offered to all that came in twelve Aſpers a day of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Pay; and declared, That their Faith and Law had no difference from the Mahometan.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior receiving theſe Advices with extreme indignation, proclaimed his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to return again into <hi>Perſia;</hi> and though the Deſign pleaſed not the Militia, who wre weary of the War, yet his Power was too great to be reſiſted, and his Humors too violent to be diverted by ſober Counſels; for having ſubjected and abſolutely ſubdued the Inſolence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſuppreſſed the Arrogance of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Church-men, he ordered every thing according to his Arbitrary and Uncontroulable Pleaſure; which being rendred Extravagant and Unſupportable, by reaſon that in his Cups, and at the time of his Debauchery, he would often take his Counſels and determine his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, were notwithſtanding with more patience endured, upon hopes that they would not be laſting, and that Exceſſes would accelerate his Death, and the end of their Oppreſſions.</p>
                  <p>The Paſha's of greateſt Note and Riches he put to Death, and confiſcated their Eſtates to his Exchequer; and whereas Avarice and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty were equally predominant in his Nature, there was ſcarce a day wherein he made not ſome demonſtration of thoſe Diſpoſitions.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh Ambaſſador making ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the releaſement of Engliſh Slaves from Captivity, was forced to purchaſe their Liberty by giving two Ruſſians, or other Slaves in the place of one Engliſh-man.</p>
                  <p>He took a ſingular delight to ſit in a Chiosk by the Sea-ſide, and from thence to ſhoot at the People with his Bow and Arrows, as they row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the Banks of the Seraglio; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Boat-men afterwards to keep themſelves at a diſtance from the Walls of the Seraglio. And as he likewiſe took pleaſure to go from one Garden to another on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> ſo if he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any ſo bold, as to put forth his Head to ſee him paſs, he commonly made him pay the price of his Curioſity by a ſhot from his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine.</p>
                  <p>In all his Gardens and places of Pleaſure, his chief Recreation was Drinking, in which his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal or almoſt ſole Companions were Emir <hi>Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi> the Perſian who betrayed <hi>Revan,</hi> and a Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian of the Family of <hi>Bianchi,</hi> who having been taken by the Turks, when he was young, was placed in the Seraglio, and educated in all the Learning and Cuſtoms of it, and becoming as well a Proficient in Drinking, as in other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he was made a Favourite and Companion to <hi>Morat.</hi> And thus did they follow this trade of Drunkenneſs ſo conſtantly, that the Health of the Grand Signior began to impair; and at length he became ſo ſenſible of his Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that he incharged the Chimacam not to obey him after Dinner: and when in the heat of his Wine he took a humor to ride through the Streets, the Janiſaires and Officers would ſometimes run before to adviſe the People to withdraw, and ſometimes drive them away with Stones, that ſo they might eſcape the hazard of this capricious Tyrant.</p>
                  <p>As it cannot be expreſſed in what Dread and Fear the People ſtood of him, ſo neither in what Veneration he was with his Servants, who obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the looks and every caſt of his Eyes; had learned his Nods, and the meaning of every Motion and Geſture of his Body. It happened once, that a Paper falling caſually from his Hand out of a Window, the Pages ran in all haſte down the Stairs, ſtriving who ſhould be the firſt to take it up; but one more deſirous than the others to evidence the Zeal of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, took the neareſt way and leaped out of the Window; and though with the fall he broke the Bone of his Thigh, yet being the firſt that took up the Paper, he came halting to preſent it with his own Hand: this bold readineſs in his Service ſo pleaſed the Grand Signior, that being cured, he was afterwards preferred to one of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39539:19"/>the moſt conſiderable Offices of the Empire. Thus was <hi>Morat</hi> revered in his Seraglio, as he was feared aboard, his Servants having the ſame awe of him, as <hi>Bagotes</hi> the Eunuch had of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, who holding the Pot of Incenſe and Perfumes whilſt his Maſter ſlept, ſuffered his Hands to burn to the Bone, rather than to awaken him by moving out of his place. <hi>Q. Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it is time now to leave off farther Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Extravagancies of <hi>Morat,</hi> and to return to the Wars in <hi>Perſia;</hi> howſoever before the departure of the Grand Signior, it will be requiſite to recount ſomewhat of the State of Affairs in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                     </note> there wanted not Exerciſes and Skirmiſhes to employ and practiſe the Souldiery, and keep them in Breath.</p>
                  <p>The Poles heightned with their good Succeſſes, would not longer endure the Incurſions of the Tartars, complaining againſt the Turk, that he had given Orders, and ſecretly abetted them in their Robberies and Invaſions, againſt the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the laſt Peace; and therefore to avenge themſelves, the Poles appeared on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers with forty or fifty thouſand Horſe: but the Grand Signior not willing in this Conjuncture to break with the Poles, abſolutely diſowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Order or Permiſſion given to the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; and being willing to continue the League, that he might oblige the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> gave liberty to all the People of that Nation,<note place="margin">The Turks confirm the Peace with <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </note> and to the Ruſſians, who had been taken ſince the Laſt Treaty, poſitively prohibiting all People from buying, or keeping any of the Subjects of that Country for Slaves, during the continuance of this Peace.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Hungary,</hi> though the Ambaſſador had but lately brought a Confirmation of the Peace from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> yet the Turks pretending that the Articles were not complied with, continued to trouble and diſturb thoſe Frontiers; for four thouſand of them being gotten into a Body, burnt certain Villages, made divers Slaves, and battered the Caſtle of <hi>Raab;</hi> but being repulſed by that Gariſon, and by that of <hi>Komorra,</hi> they again made Head, and encamped within three Leagues of <hi>Presbourg:</hi> The which gave great trouble to the Emperor, both becauſe he had lately declared a War againſt <hi>France,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he apprehended, that thoſe Commotions of the Turks were deſigned to no other end,<note place="margin">Send For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                     </note> than to engage him to renounce all aſſiſtance and ſuccour to be given unto <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already recounted in what manner the Turks had eſpouſed the Quarrel of <hi>Stephen Gabor,</hi> and reſolved to eſtabliſh him in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> with the Ruin of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski;</hi> which now being deſigned to be done by open Force, ſeveral Troops were ſent to the Frontiers of <hi>Tranſylvania;</hi> which ſo alarmed the Hungarians, that they put themſelves on their Guard, and obliged the Eſtates of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> to contribute toward the Succour of the Tranſylvanian Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor remained long in ſuſpenſe what courſe to ſteer, until at length the Perſwaſions of the Confederate Princes, the ſhame of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning a Friend and an Ally for a Prey to the Turks, and the fear of diſpleaſing his Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Dominions in <hi>Hungary,</hi> who conſidered <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania</hi> as the Bulwark of their Country, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to promiſe ſecretly, and underhand, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Turks themſelves, the Effects did not correſpond with their Menaces: for though they had gathered an Army of twenty thouſand Men at <hi>Buda,</hi> they not only were diſappointed of their Deſign upon <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> but were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repulſed, and ſhamefully expelled the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers by the palatine of <hi>Hungary:</hi> And <hi>Ragotski</hi> being recruited by Succours from the Emperor, and by an Alliance with <hi>Poland,</hi> defied the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Turk, and contemned the Reports of ſixty thouſand Men preparing to march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>For indeed the Grand Signior had too great an Incumbrance on his Shoulders by the War in <hi>Perſia,</hi> to attend unto a perfect and ſtudied Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge againſt <hi>Ragotski;</hi> for <hi>Revan</hi> being reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Perſian, (as we have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) was a Matter of high Moment; and what diſtracted all his Counſels, and weakened his Hopes.</p>
                  <p>When News came firſt of the Siege of <hi>Revan,</hi> Orders were given to the Vizier to Beſiege <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,</hi> as a means to cauſe a diverſion of Arms;<note place="margin">Mutiny in the Turkiſh Army.</note> but the Souldiery entertaining an averſion to this Enterpriſe, unanimouſly refuſed to March, or to proceed farther than <hi>Erzrum. Jambolat Ogli,</hi> who commanded the Army before the the Arrival of the Vizier, had ſtrangled a Paſha, and taken his Eſtate to ſupply the Wants of the Army; and had likewiſe put to Death ſeveral Spahees and Janiſaries for Mutiny, and becauſe they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an unwillingneſs to this War. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery prepared to addreſs themſelves to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier for Juſtice againſt theſe violent Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but he not willing to hear them, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to divert their Complaints, which cauſed a greater Commotion and Storm than before. And though <hi>Jambolat</hi> pleaded hid Orders and poſitive Commiſſion from the Grand Signior for what he had acted; yet that Allegation not being accepted by the Multitude as a juſtifiable Plea, the Vizier was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to their Deſire, and ſtrangle <hi>Jambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat,</hi> as he had done the others, being the only Means to quiet and compoſe this Trouble of his Army.</p>
                  <p>But as after ſome great Storm, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remaining for a while a ſwelling and fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Waters, ſo there ſtill remained on the Spirits of the Souldiery, Diſcontents and unquietneſs of Mind: Wherefore the Vizier fearing leſt the Enemy taking advantage of the preſent Seditions, ſhould charge them at a time of Diſorder, he retired at a diſtance from them into the Plains of <hi>Erzrum:</hi> But he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to continue long in thoſe Parts for want of Fuel, and of Wood and Planks to ſecure them againſt the Rains and Snow; for it being Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is rigorous and cold in that Country, their Tents were not ſufficient proof to defend them againſt the Extremity of the Weather.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the Turkiſh Army remained at this Place, advice came,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Van</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Perſians.</note> that the Perſians had Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged <hi>Van,</hi> which is a ſtrong Fortreſs ſituate on an inacceſſible Rock, on the Frontiers of the Province of <hi>Diarbequir.</hi> And though the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were not able to take this Place, neither by Storm nor Famine, yet during this Siege, they made uſe of their time to ruin all the Country of <hi>Diarbequir,</hi> which they left ſo deſolate, that the Turkiſh Army could not quarter there, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the leaſt Proviſion or Subſiſtence from thence.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe Misfortunes a greater was added by the Treachery of a certain <hi>Curd,</hi> one who pretending to be ill-ſatisfied with the Perſian Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, voluntarily offered himſelf to the Service of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39539:20"/>the Turks; and having done them ſome little Services, by being their Guide through certain difficult Paſſages, he gained a confidence ſo far with them, as that deſigning to ſurpriſe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Enemy, they committed themſelves to his Guidance and Conduct; who having brought them into a narrow Paſſage,<note place="margin">Fifteen thouſand Turks kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in an Ambuſh.</note> where an Ambuſh of the Enemy lay, he then turned his Coat, and fought againſt the Turks, of whom 15000 were killed and taken in this Snare.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, all Matters of this War proceeded croſs and unfortunate for the Turks; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their unlucky Fights with the Enemy, their own Seditions in the Camp were greater Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs;<note place="margin">Mutiny of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</note> for now enduring no longer theſe pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Miſeries, under the pretence of wanting Pay, they cut in pieces the Treaſurer of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, two Aga's of the Spahees, and the Chaouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhee of the Janiſaries.</p>
                  <p>This News arriving at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when <hi>Morat</hi> was afflicted with a grievous acceſſion of the Gout, ſerved to redouble his Pains; in which raving againſt the Conduct of his Officers, he immediately deprived the Vizier of his Charge, and ordained <hi>Biram</hi> Paſha, late Chimacam, to ſucceed him in his Employment.</p>
                  <p>The new Vizier immediately ſet forth the Horſes Tail,<note place="margin">A new Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier ſent to the Army.</note> which is a ſignal of departure, with ſound of Drums and Trumpets, making Corban, which is a diſtribution of Mutton to the Poor, in divers Places: His Retinue was ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily equipped with ſuch ſumptuous Magnificence, that it looked rather like the Train of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, which intended to make Peace, than to the Troops of a General, whoſe Buſineſs was nothing but Blood and Deſtruction. And indeed Matters ſeemed to be inclining that way, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians having far advanced in this Negotiation; for they wiſely pondering the immenſe Force of the Ottoman Empire, with which they were now contending, judged it the moſt politick courſe to make Peace, under the auſpicious Planet of their good Fortune; for not knowing how long that might remain conſtant, they might, ſo ſoon as the Wheel turns on the other ſide, be forced to accept Terms of leſs Advantage than at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they might promiſe to themſelves under their happy Stars.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore a Propoſition being made of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Ambaſſador to the Grand Signior,<note place="margin">A Perſian Ambaſſador ſent to the G.

The Grand Signior entertaining ſome real Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to Peace, laid aſide ſomething of his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Grandeur and State, giving the Ambaſſador Audience in a few days after his arrival; and as nothing molliſies the hard Mettle of a Turk's Spirit, like a gentle Shower of Gold, and the emulgent ſoftneſs of Rich Preſents; ſo <hi>Morat</hi> underſtanding of Gifts with which he came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, afforded to the Ambaſſador an eaſy Ear and a pleaſing Countenance.</p>
                  <p>The Preſents for the Grand Signior, beſides thoſe for the Court, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Theſe Preſents ſo well diſpoſed and prepared the Mind of the Grand Signior towards an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, that he beſtowed a kind Aſpect and gentle Words on the Ambaſſador, ſo that all the World expected that a Peace would have enſued.</p>
                  <p>And indeed one might well have believed his Reality in this Intention, ſince the ardent Paſſion he had to be revenged of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> availed more with him than all other Conſiderations in the World. His Honour alſo called him to give a ſtop to the Progreſs of the Moſcovites, who had taken <hi>Aſac;</hi> and the Tartars and Coſſacks gave ſome ground of Jealouſy, that before long they deſigned ſome Action on the Turkiſh Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: the Reaſons whereof we ſhall diſcourſe in this following Year.</p>
                  <p>We have already related, ſome Years paſt, on what Terms the Tartars ſtood with the Turk, how they refuſed to accept that King which the Port recommended to them, though the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and firſt of the true Line: how they fought and overthrew the Forces which the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior ſent to compel them to the Election he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; and this laſt Year, upon pretence of a War with <hi>Cantemir,</hi>

                     </note> they refuſed to ſend their Army againſt the Perſian, as had always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary to do againſt the Enemies of the Sultan, whenſoever required.</p>
                  <p>The Paſha, Muftee, and Kadi of <hi>Caffa</hi> (which is the Grand Signior's Town in <hi>Tartary</hi>) urged the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> to prepare and forward his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to the Duty and Obligation which was incumbent on him; and enlivening their Arguments with Reproaches of Cowardiſe and Ingratitude; ſo far provoked the <hi>Han,</hi> that he cauſed them all three to be ſtrangled.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this high Provocation, the Grand Signior diſſembled the Injury, leſt a due Reſentment ſhould raiſe them into an open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: and diſſembling an approbation of the Fact, as done with Reaſon and Juſtice, ſent to the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> a Sword and a Veſt, as Signals of his Favour: And farther ſuſpecting, leſt in proſecution of ſo ſenſible a Blow, the Tartar joining in League with the Coſſacks and Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, ſhould make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Caffa,</hi> he prudently touched the Wound with a gentle Hand, offering to ordain ſuch a Paſha, as ſhould be warranted with his Aſſent and Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>The Tartar being overcome by ſuch Lenitives as theſe, proteſted that he never entertained other Thoughts, than to maintain his Faith and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance inviolable towards the Grand Signior; and that the Alliance he had made with the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay</hi> Tartars, and the Forces now raiſed, were maintained with no other Deſign, than to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Rebellion and Inſolence of <hi>Cantemir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Cantemir</hi> being a Perſon of a bold Spirit, and daring in all his Actions, did oftentimes, by virtue of his own Authority, lead a ſtrong Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Field, being followed by the braveſt and ſtouteſt Souldiers of <hi>Tartary;</hi> for which Reaſon being hated by the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi>

                  <p>In a ſhort time, divers chief Captains being deſirous to follow the Enſigns of ſo famous a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, came in to him; and multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple forſaking the Sands and barren Rocks of <hi>Tartary,</hi> came crowding into this Country; that the Plains of <hi>Budziak</hi> not being capable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, they paſſed into <hi>Moldavia;</hi> where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching on the Lands of the proper Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, gave a Jealouſie as if they intended to take poſſeſſion of the whole Province.</p>
                  <p>The Poles being jealous of theſe ill Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which lay at the Gate of their Country, ready to enter on all occaſions, had made Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in their laſt Articles of Peace with the Grand Signior, that he ſhould force them to return, and urged that point by the Ambaſſador with all earneſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>The Tartar <hi>Han</hi> alſo finding his Countries depopulated and weakened by ſo large an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation, made alſo his Complaints and Addreſſes to the Port. But the Grand Signior looking on this Colony, as an increaſe of his Dominions, and to be compoſed of ſuch People whom Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt render obedient; and that they could eaſily, at his Command, make Irruptions into <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> ſeemed deaf to all Applications in this Buſineſs; and as if they were a People in whom he had no part, ſhewed no concernment for them, though ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he promiſed them his Protection.</p>

The Venetians when they addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more to Traffick and Commerce than they do at preſent, took this Scale for their Way into <hi>Perſia.</hi> The Town was fortified with ancient Walls, flanked with capacious Towers, and with a Caſtle which being in the middle, and on the ſide of the Water, divides the Town, as it were, into two equal parts. The Gariſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted not of above three or four hundred Men; for being a place remote from powerful Enemies, it fell not under any great jealouſie, now was it deemed worthy of the Charge of numerous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendats.</p>

This happening at a time when the Turks were diverted by the Perſian War, the Coſſacks injoyed this new Conqueſt for the ſpace of four Years without moleſtation, until that in the Year 1641, it was recovered with much Blood and Slaughter by the Arms of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> as we ſhall hereafter recount in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>

They have no Wine, but uſe themſelves much to Strong-waters. Their Houſes are not built of Wood or Stone, but of Oſiers, interwoven and daubed over with Earth and Lime; ſo that they uſe no Nails or Iron: they have no Merchants unleſs in <hi>Kiow;</hi> nor do they ſerve themſelves of Phyſicians or Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Their learned Language, or the Tongue wherein they write, is the Sclavonian, anciently called the Illyrian: ſo that in all things this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is rude and barbarous; and though their manner of Government and Policy is not refined or methodically diſpoſed, yet nevertheleſs it is ſolid and of deep Foundation, appropriated to the nature and diſpoſition of that People.</p>

According to this counſel <hi>Aſac</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſaulted and taken, (as we have already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated) the Coſſacks fortified it in the beſt manner that they were able, making an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal for their Boats and Saicks, whereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they did much more infeſt the Turks than before.</p>
                  <p>The other Coſſacks who continued in their Country, being much perſecuted by the Poliſh Nobility, choſe <hi>Kilminieſchi</hi> for their General, (the Son of a Noble Family in <hi>Lituania,</hi> but ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and degraded of his Honour for his Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Offences) and rebelled againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. At firſt not being able to reſiſt the Force of <hi>Poland,</hi> they retired within the Woods; but joining afterwards with other Coſſacks, they iſſued forth at the beginning of the Spring, beat the Poles, and carried away a conſiderable Boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

Only thus far it is pertinent to the Matter diſcuſſed for us to have ſhewn, That the Counſels of <hi>Poland</hi> were in a great Error, when they reſolved to change the Life, and alter the Humour of this Warlike People, which being protected in their Priviledges, and encouraged in their Wars, would at all Times, as occaſion ſerved, have been ready to have ejected great numbers of good Souldiers into the Ottoman Territories, and might ſtill have been conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ballance the Power of the Tartars, which now daily infeſt and ruin the Borders of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>To conſerve ſtill the Order of this Militia, he appointed Officers ſtrictly and ſeverely to take the Decimation of the Chriſtian Children in <hi>Europe,</hi> and leſt (as was uſual) they ſhould be corrupted by the Parents, who often give Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, whereby to blind the Eyes of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that ſo they may overſee their Children, or in lieu of the comlieſt and moſt fit for Service, accept of the Sickly and Impotent, or ſuch as are unworthy of the Bread and Education given them by the Sultan, he moſt ſeverely injoined this Service, and under a thouſand Menaces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the care hereof to be executed without Favour or Partiality to any. He carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed the Books of the Timjar-Spahees, count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the number exactly that every Country yields, and comparing them with thoſe muſtered in the Field, he confiſcated the Lands of thoſe that wanted, being forfeited for non-appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: he would admit of no Excuſe or Delay to the Matter in hand. The Superintendant of the Ordnance but making a Scruple about the Proportion of ſome Guns, as too weighty and unwieldy for ſo long a March, loſt his Life, for doubting or making a difficulty in what the Grand Signior propoſed or deſigned.</p>
                  <p>And that no Commotions at home might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or call him back before his Buſineſs was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he encharged his Paſha's of the Fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to live quietly with their Neighbours, and to be ſure to give no occaſions of Complaint, or Cauſe for War during his abſence; recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prudence of the Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria</hi> the care of compoſing certain Differences between the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Walachia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having ſecured Matters as well as he could at home, he ordered the Horſe-tail to be ſet forth at the gate of the Divan, and all Paſha's and Officers of the Army did the like at their own Doors. His Troops began now to grow nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; the Spahees and Timariots appointed for the Guard of the Grand Signior's Tents, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other Cavalry, which hold their Lands under Service, amounted unto two hundred thouſand. From the hundred ſeventy two Chambers of Janiſaries he drew forth thirty thouſand. From the Topgees or Gunners, whereof there are no more than twelve hundred in their Chambers at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> yet make up twelve thouſand in other parts, he drew out three thouſand for the preſent Service. The Shepherds and Plough-men of <hi>Bulgaria</hi> made up twenty thouſand; which with Water-bearers, Smiths, Bakers, Butchers, and all other Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which followed the Camp, were in vaſt Numbers: ſo that the whole Army, with the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants belonging thereunto, were at a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate calculation computed to amount unto near five hundred thouſand Men; whereof three hundred thouſand were fighting Men.</p>
                  <p>The Peſtilence, which is the Epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of <hi>Turkie,</hi> and which abates the Numbers and Pride of that People, raged this Year great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in the parts of <hi>Romag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> it entred into the Seraglio, and amongſt others, took away the only Son of the Grand Signior of two or three Years old. This cauſed <hi>Morat</hi> to paſs moſt part of the Summer at a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> where he recreated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his drunken Companion the Perſian Traitor; and hereby he contradicted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>That Princes love the Treaſon, but not the Traitor;</hi> for <hi>Morat</hi> it ſeems loved them both, entertaining this Fellow in his Boſom: His Cloaths, his Garb, his Horſes, and Equipage, might rival with that of the Sultan's; He took place of the Chimacam in all Publick Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and what was moſt ſtrange, he preceded the Mufti; which was a new Form never before practiſed, and would have afforded matter of Wonder and Diſcourſe, but that the World conſidered this Novelty, as a Method agreeable to the extravagant Humor of the Sultan.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt his Paſtimes, nothing was more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than ſome Divertiſement acted with Blood; he ſhot the Son of a Paſha with his Gun, for daring to approach near the Walls of his Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, ſuppoſing that he came with curioſity to diſcover his Pleaſures,<note place="margin">The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Pleaſures and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi>
                     </note> and manner of voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Recreations: For the ſame Reaſon he would have ſunk a Boat laden with Women, as it glided ſlowly by the Banks of the Garden. He would himſelf behold two Thieves impailed, which were condemned to die for robbing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of his Seraglio. He commanded the Head of the Treaſurer of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to be cut off in his preſence; as alſo the Maſter of his Muſick, for daring to ſing a certain Air which ſeemed Perſian, and to praiſe the Valour of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Paſha of <hi>Temiſwar</hi> he put to Death at a full Divan, for fighting unfortunately againſt <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe ſevere Acts of Cruelty, which he called Juſtice, he added one not unpleaſant; A certain Greek called <hi>Stridia Bei,</hi> or Lord <hi>Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> who had been Prince of <hi>Walachia,</hi> and one whom we have before mentioned, having, by his oppreſſion and haraſſing that People, amaſſed a conſiderable Sum of Mony, eſſayed a ſecond time, by force thereof, to obtain the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and making his Offer and Requeſt before the Grand Signior, he was heard with ſome railery: At length the Grand Signior told him, That he was too proud and aſpiring, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordered the tips of his Noſe and Ears to be cut off, telling him, that that was to clip the Wings of his Ambition.</p>
                  <p>But that before his departure for <hi>Perſia,</hi> he might conſummate his Acts of Tyranny, he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed one upon his Brother, a Youth of Twenty two Years of Age, of great Hopes, and good Endowments. He was conducted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Brother, at the Biram, to pay his Reſpects, as is uſual at that Feſtival; and having performed the Ceremony, he enlarged himſelf in high Praiſes and Admiration of the Grand
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:39539:22"/>Signior's Generoſity and Bravery; who for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> was contented to expoſe his Perſon to the Inconveniences of a long Journey, and the Dangers of a hazardous War, and that therein he equalled, if not ſurpaſſed, the Glory of his Anceſtors: Which courtly and rational manner of Diſcourſe did not pleaſe <hi>Morat,</hi> but rather adminiſtred Subject of Jealouſy, fearing that he knew too much; and that as he could Speak well, ſo he might Act accordingly; wherefore the ſame Day he cauſed him to be ſtrangled, to the great Sorrow of the People, and deteſtation of his Abominable Tyranny: But to amuſe the Minds of the Multitude, and ceaſe their Murmurings, he cauſed it to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged abroad; that fourteen of his Women in the Seraglio were with Child: which was all falſe, there remaining none of the Ottoman Race beſides his Brother Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who was Weak, as well in Body as Underſtanding, and whoſe Imperfections ſecured and compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Life: And to ſuppreſs the Diſcourſe about his Brother's Murder, he changed it into a talk about his Preparations for War, and his departure for <hi>Perſia.</hi> Wherefore the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners and Harbingers of the Army being ſent away with Labourers to repair Bridges, and to level the Ways for the more eaſie paſſage of the Cannon. <hi>Morat</hi> paſſed over to his Tents at <hi>Scutari,</hi> cloathed in a Coat of Mail, and with a Head-piece ſet with Precious Stones, and his Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouch or Feathers claſped to it with Buckles of Diamonds.</p>
                  <p>As he landed at <hi>Scutari,</hi> he was received by three Squadrons of Souldiers, each Squadron conſiſting of four thouſand Men well Armed, and richly Attired; the Garments of one Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of which were provided at the Expence of the Grand Signior, and of the other two at the Charge of his Favourite, and of the Captain-Paſha: the latter of which preſented to the Grand Signior thirty Purſes of Mony, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing on him the Honour to command that Gally which tranſported him to the Aſian Coaſt. The Ambaſſador ſent from <hi>Perſia</hi> was detained at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> until this time, and after the Turkiſh Faſhion not permitted to depart at his own liberty; but being now ordered to follow the Camp, his Port and Quarters were aſſigned, that ſo he might be a Spectator of that Tragedy which was now to be acted. All things were now diſpoſed in good Poſture, with much So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, in order to a March; the Conacks, or days Journies, with their Places of Quarters, were laid out in an hundred and twenty days of March from <hi>Scutary</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſeventy days of Otorack or Repoſe. The Journies with the groſs Body of ſuch an Army could not be long; and the joyning with other Forces in the way, required leiſure and time.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, the Horſe, after the Turkiſh man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having eaten their Graſs and been ſoiled, this powerful Army decamped from <hi>Scutari</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of <hi>May.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The March of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Army.</note> The firſt day of Oto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rack or Repoſe was appointed at <hi>Iſmit,</hi> where the Grand Signior made a review of his Army; ſuch as were Aged, and unable to endure the Fatigues of a long March, he diſmiſſed, giving them half Pay for their Lives, with the Name of Otoracks, which is the ſame with <hi>Milites E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriti</hi> among the Romans: with exact Order therefore and ſevere Diſcipline, to which their fierce Monarch had reduced them, marched this numerous Army; no Villages were abuſed, nor Country-people plundred, and all things were purchaſed with ready Mony: And the Grand Signior himſelf being rendred more gentle and tractable in the Field than in his Seraglio, heard all Complaints, and diſtributed Juſtice with an equal and impartial Hand.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, at <hi>Couſtantinople,</hi> due care was taken to keep things Quiet and in Order; the Boſtangibaſhee, like Lord High Chamberlain, had the Charge committed to him of the Seraglio, and the Moveables of it; he frequently made his Rounds both by Sea and Land, puniſhed thoſe whom he found in Taverns; nor would he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Candles to be lighted after two hours in the Night. The Chimacam, and the Captain-Paſha, likewiſe executed their Offices with all care and ſeverity in their reſpective Stations.</p>
                  <p>At this time, to the great diſſatisfaction of the Greek Nation, <hi>Cyril</hi> the Patriarch,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyrillus</hi> the Patriarch ſtrangled.</note> who had been in <hi>England,</hi> and greatly affected with the Diſcipline of our Church, was depoſed, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned in the Seven Towers, and ſtrangled: in his place one <hi>Carfila</hi> was ordained Patriarch, and his Commiſſion or Baratz obtained from the Grand Signior at the expence of fifty thouſand Crowns, one Moity whereof was paid from <hi>Rome,</hi> the whole Deſign againſt <hi>Cyrillus</hi> being managed by the Jeſuits and other Religious living at <hi>Galata,</hi> who accuſed him before the Turks, of keeping a ſecret Correſpondence with the Moſcovites and Coſſacks; for which loſing his Life <hi>Carfila,</hi> a pretended Friend to the Roman Faction, was inſtituted Patriarch.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior marching with his potent and numerous Army, all the World remained at a gaze what the Iſſue ſhould be of this mighty Enterpriſe; yet moſt were of Opinion, that the Honour and Riches of the Ottoman Empire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now at Stake, the War could not otherwiſe conclude than with the Conqueſt of <hi>Babylon.</hi> All that could be feared, was ſome diverſion by the Chriſtian Princes; who taking hold of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Conjuncture, ſhould enter the Frontiers with a powerful Army, and thereby force the Sultan to return. But as to <hi>Poland,</hi> the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy ſoon vaniſhed. When the News came of a Civil War between the Poles and the Coſſacks, and that ten thouſand of the latter were ſlain in a Battel, this Intelligence came moſt ſeaſonable and grateful to the Port, expecting now a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Coſſacks, deſiring Succour in their Extremity; for ſuch Accidente as theſe have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the Turkiſh Intereſt, which hath grown out of the Civil Diſcords of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>By this means, as the Apprehenſions of War by Land ceaſed, ſo there appeared ſome Clouds of Storm at Sea; which doubtleſs might have produced a War with <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Turks been at leiſure to attend it; for ſixteen Gallies belonging to <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Biſerta,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pirats of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> infeſt the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </note> well armed with Slaves and Souldiers, and provided ſufficiently with Cannon, Powder, and Bullet, Commanded by <hi>Ali Picenin,</hi> united together and formed a ſmall Fleet, with deſign to rove over the Adriatick Sea, and infeſt the Coaſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> Their Intentions were to plunder the Riches of <hi>Loretto;</hi> but being hindred by contrary Winds, from entring ſo high into the Gulf, they made a deſcent in <hi>Puglia,</hi> and ſacked all the Country of <hi>Nicotra,</hi> carrying away a great Booty, with Slaves, and amongſt them ſeveral Nuns which they proſtituted to their Luſt; thence they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over to the ſide of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and in ſight of <hi>Cataro</hi> took a Veſſel, and made Prize of all Ships which they met in thoſe Seas; the Rumor of which made great noiſe over all <hi>Italy,</hi> the People exclaiming againſt their Princes for ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:39539:22"/>their Lives and Eſtates to remain ſubject to the petty Force of a few Pirats. For the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> were disjoined, and roving after purchaſe in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> took little notice of what was acted in the Gulf. The Spaniards, after their faſhion, were ſlow in Arming, and ſpent the Summer in Preparations, till the Pirats, laden with Booty, were depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the Winter; ſo that none remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take care of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Venetian Gulf, but <hi>Venice</hi> only, to whom the Dominion of thoſe Seas are rightly appropriated.</p>
                  <p>To ſuppreſs therefore the Inſolence of theſe Pirats, the Republick ſet forth a Fleet conſiſting of twenty eight Gallies and two Galleaſſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Marin Capello,</hi> with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to ſink, burn, and deſtroy thoſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, either in the open Seas, or in Harbour of the Turks; for that by the Articles of Peace, between the Grand Signior and the Venetians, it was agreed, That no Port or Harbour of his ſhould be priviledged to afford entertainment or protection to any Free-booter or Pirat of that nature.</p>
                  <p>It happened about that time, that the Malteſes and Florentines cruſing in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> had done great Miſchief to the Turks in thoſe Seas; to revenge which, and to prevent farther da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, the Captain-Paſha ſent Orders to theſe Veſſels of <hi>Barbary</hi> immediately to come to his Aſſiſtance; to which they were now more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily perſwaded; for being already laden with Booty and Spoils, they contented themſelves with a change of their Station. But to give a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel to thoſe Parts, they firſt reſolved to ſpoil, and plunder <hi>Liſſa,</hi> aliàs <hi>Leſina,</hi> an Iſland belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Republick; but being overtaken by the Venetian Fleet in their Voyage thither, near to <hi>Valona,</hi> a Port and Harbour belonging to the Turks, they put themſelves under the Defence of the Town and Caſtle, which received them willingly to their Protection, notwithſtanding all Articles and Agreements to the contrary. The Venetian Fleet ſaluted the Caſtle without a Shot,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Capello</hi> blocks up the Pirats in <hi>Valona.</hi>
                     </note> deſiring, that according to the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Peace, the Pirats might be rejected, and commanded to abandon their Port: in anſwer hereunto the Turks replied with a Shot, making known their Intentions to defend their Friends: wherefore the Venetians retiring at ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance came to an Anchor, deſigning to block up the Port. Many days had not paſſed before the Pirats endeavoured, by help of their Oars, and a gentle Gale, to make their eſcape; and being, with the gray of the Morning, advanced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Port, they were eſpyed by the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Venetians, who dividing their Fleet into two Squadrons, charged them with high Courage; the Fight continued for the ſpace of two hours, during all which time the Caſtle of <hi>Valona</hi> fired at the Venetians, and ſhot down a Maſt of one of the Galleaſes, a Splinter of which wounded <hi>Lorenzo Marcello</hi> the Commander; at length five of the Gallies of the Pirats being diſabled, any many of their People killed, they began to fly, and retire again under the Protection of the Town; as alſo did the Venetians to their Place of Anchorage.</p>
                  <p>A diſtinct Advice of all Particulars being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to <hi>Venice,</hi> the Senate wrote to <hi>Capello,</hi> That ſince the reſpect which the Republick owes to the Ottoman Court was not unknown to him, he ſhould by no means make any attempt againſt thoſe Pirats upon the Land, but meeting them fairly at Sea, he ought then to make uſe of all the valour and force he was able.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Medina las Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> Vice-King of <hi>Naples,</hi> diſpatched an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to <hi>Capello,</hi> with Letters applauding the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of the Deſign, wherein he was now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for the Glory of his Republick, and the Common Good of all Chriſtendom, proffering to ſupply him with Refreſhments and Ammunition, and what elſe might ſupply his Occaſions; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, that by ſuch Encouragement as this, he might be induced to Aſſault the Enemies in <hi>Valona,</hi> without reſpect to the Grand Signior, or any Inconveniences which might ariſe thereby. On the contrary the Governour of the Caſtle, and Kadi of the Town wrote a Letter to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello,</hi> putting him in mind, that he was within the Grand Signior's Dominions, and that he ſhould be careful how he offered any Violence to thoſe Places, which would certainly prove a Violation of the Peace, and be the Original of an inevitable War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Capello</hi> had now lain a whole Month before the Port, having all the time injoied fair Weather, and a ſmooth Sea, againſt the hope and deſire of the Turks, who expected that by means of ſome Storm, the Enemy would be forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their Quarters to ſome ſecure Harbour, and thereby afford them an opportunity to eſcape.<note place="margin">He aſſaults them in the Port.</note> But <hi>Capello</hi> growing weary of ſuch te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Attendance, reſolved to expect no longer, nor yet to loſe the preſent Advantage of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring himſelf Maſter of the Veſſels of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: wherefore dividing his Fleet into ſeveral Squadrons, he advanced near the Port, firing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shot at the Tents of the Pirats, of which one from a Galeaſs ſtruck a Moſch; and arming with ſtore of Men the Galeots and Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines, they entred the Port, and to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and vexation of the Turks, poſſeſſed all the ſixteen Veſſels, and brought them to their Admiral: which though they had disfurniſhed of all their chief Booty, yet their Cannon and Arms remained, of which there were twelve Pieces of great Braſs Guns, beſides others of Iron, with divers Falcons and leſſer Arms.</p>
                  <p>The Intelligence hereof being carried to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> Orders were given, that all the Veſſels ſhould be ſunk in the Port of <hi>Corfu,</hi> excepting only the Admiral of <hi>Algier,</hi> which was to be brought to the Arſenal of <hi>Venice,</hi> there to remain as a Trophy of Victory, and for a perpetual Memory of this Glorious Atchievement. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever this Exploit was variouſly interpreted at <hi>Venice,</hi> and approved, or diſproved, according to the diverſity of Humors. The younger Men applauded it as an Action of great Gallantry, excuſing his Tranſgreſſion of the Senats Orders by a tranſport of Paſſion and Zeal towards his Country, and deſire of Glory. But the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Men of mature Judgments, highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented this Breach of their Orders, which as they are ſtrictly Enjoined, ſo they expected that they ſhould be punctually Obeyed. That this action was a ſufficient and Juſt Cauſe alone to kindle a War, and that it was a matter intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a ſingle Citizen ſhould of his own Head and Humor, preſume to act ſuch things, as muſt neceſſarily involve the Publick in a War, contrary to their Pleaſure, and in oppoſition to their expreſs Commands. For which Crime and other ſubſequent Defaults, <hi>Capello</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forced to juſtify himſelf, as will be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>The Particulars of this Advice, were by an expreſs Meſſenger diſpatched to <hi>Luigi Contari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi> the Bailo or Ambaſſador for the Venetians at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a Perſon of great Reputation and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:39539:23"/>Eſteem, having been converſant in the principal Courts of Chriſtendom, and employed for the ſpace of ſeven years at <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he was Aſſiſtant with the Nuntio <hi>Chigi,</hi> afterwards <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>7th,</hi> in the general Peace of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks alſo receiving this News aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them with all the foul Circumſtances ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, the Chimacam immediately ſummoned the Bailo to Audience, and with an Angry Countenance began to exclaim: <q>That taking advantage of the Grand Signior's abſence in remote Parts, the Venetians had, in a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and hoſtile manner, aſſaulted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the Fleet of <hi>Barbary,</hi> which were his Subjects, and ſuch as he had called to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance againſt the Corſares of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn.</hi> That being accidentally compelled by ſtorm to enter into the Port of <hi>Valonia,</hi> they were forcibly taken thence, and violence offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Grand Signior's Port and Caſtle, by way of a manifeſt and open Breach. If this preſumption were grounded on the long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Grand Signior from theſe parts, the Venetians would do well to conſider, how that they provoke an angry Prince, and one who eſteems neither Expence, Hazards, nor Labours to compleat his Revenge. If this were a deſign to divert the Grand Signior's Arms from <hi>Perſia,</hi> they would do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the Sultan was not ſo far advanced, but that he could turn a Current, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſufficient to drown, and in an inſtant to overwhelm the Dominions of <hi>Venice;</hi> or could at leaſt collect Forces from nearer parts able to revenge his Quarrel, and vindicate his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the Diſdain and Scorn of ſuch pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Neighbours.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereunto the Bailo or Ambaſſador made this Reply: <q>That this Piratical People was the ſame which the Year before had landed in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and made ſpoil of the Eſtates of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and carried many of them into ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and not contented with this Booty, they entred the Gulph, and penetrated into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> with deſign to Sack and Plunder the Iſland of <hi>Liſſa,</hi> which was under the Dominion of the Republick. That the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian General friendly ſaluted the Caſtle of <hi>Valona,</hi> which was returned with ſeveral Shots from thence; that had it been his intention to have attempted the Port in the beginning, he would not have lain thirty ſeven days in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the forth-coming of thoſe Pirats, it being only reſpect to the Grand Signior, which obliged him to that attendance. At length being wearied, and provoked by the inſolenee of that People, he forcibly entred the Port, knowing, that by Capitulations with the Grand Signior, it was agreed, That all Ports ſhould be forbidden, and that to theſe Pirats, unleſs they firſt gave Security and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to injure and make Prize of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Republick.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chimacam replied hereunto, <q>That there were ten thouſand Souldiers and Slaves belonging to thoſe Gallies, which had taken their Refuge in <hi>Valona;</hi> and therefore he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Venetians to permit them free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage into their own Country, and to reſtore their Gallies, unleſs they intended to come to an open Rupture with the Grand Signior.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chimacam alſo preſſed more urgently for reſtitution of the Gallies, in regard, that having adviſed the Grand Signior of this Diſaſter, he had at the ſame time given him hopes, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſſurance to believe, that by his Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he ſhould recover them out of their Hands: But the Senate was of a different Opinion; and therefore gave expreſs Orders to their Officers of the Marine Affairs, immediatly to ſink all thoſe Veſſels; that ſo the expectation of the Turks being diſappointed by an impoſſibility of recovery, might not, by the rude Inſtances and Threats of <hi>Morat,</hi> oblige them to a diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and an undecent Reſtitution.</p>
                  <p>The News of this Misfortune made greater noiſe and diſturbance in the Divan of <hi>Algier</hi> than at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines angry at this News.</note> that rude Rabble raved, and railed, and threatned, laying the blame ſometimes on one, then on another, being ready to come to blows amongſt themſelves; but that being obliged, by order of their Divan, to keep their Thumbs within their Girdles, they durſt only expreſs their Anger by Punches and Thruſts of their Elbows. At length coming to cooler Terms, they charged all the Fault on their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral <hi>Ali,</hi> and reſolved to make Applications to the Grand Signior for Redreſs, and Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the Eſtates af the Venetians in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                  <p>The News alſo hereof overtaking <hi>Morat</hi> in his March into <hi>Perſia,</hi>

Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Anger againſt the Ventians.</note> angred him to the Heart, and tranſported him to that heat of Indignation, that he immediately ordered, that the Venetian Bailo, with all his Nation in the Ottoman Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, ſhould without exception, be cut to pieces; but the Great Vizier, and his Favourite, ſuffering him for ſome time to vent the impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his Fume and Rage without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave a ſtop for thirteen days to the diſpatch of theſe fatal Orders; until taking him in a more gentle mood, they perſwaded him to change this Sentence of Death, to the impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only of the Bailo; and ſuch care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, leſt the News of a War with <hi>Venice</hi> ſhould fly into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and thereby prejudice the Terms of Peace, that this Accident was kept as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and communicated to none, but ſuch as were nearly concerned in the Government.</p>
                  <p>The Command for the Bailo's Impriſonment being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he was ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Audience by the Chimacam; and though at that time he was exceedingly afflicted with the Gout, yet the Turkiſh Obedience to Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Commands admitting of no Excuſe, he was forced to an attendance; and being brought in his Sedan, he was carried to the Chamber of Audience, where he expected ſome time until the Chimacam came to him: in the interim being entertained by ſome Aga's, whom the Chimacam had employed to ſound him touching the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Veſſels; who finding by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe that they were ſunk, without poſſibility of recovery, and that there could be no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation made for them, they returned with this Anſwer to the Chimacam: of which being now informed, he came in, and having no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to expoſtulate on this Matter, produced the Grand Signior's Command for his Impriſonment, and kiſſing it firſt, cauſed it to be road. The Bailo replied, That he was ready to ſubmit,<note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Bailo impriſonec.</note> being not only willing to ſuffer Impriſonment, but alſo Martyrdom, accompanied with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt Pains, for the ſake of his Prince and his Country.</p>
                  <p>To ſoften and mitigate Matters, the other Chriſtian Ambaſſadors then reſident at the Port, had made Arz to the Grand Signior, wherein, with all reverence and reſpect, they offered themſelves for Mediators in this Difference, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging themſelves, but not the Parole of their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:39539:23"/>Princes, for the Perſon of the Bailo, that he ſhould not fly from the Port, nor yet refuſe any reaſonable Terms by way of Accommodation. This Mediation of the Ambaſſadors, ſeconded with ſome Preſents from the Bailo to the Turkiſh Miniſters, ſo facilitated Matters, that the Bailo at firſt was conducted to the<note n="*" place="margin">The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micam's Steward.</note> Kahya's Chamber, and afterwards was confined to his own Houſe in <hi>Galata,</hi> guarded by four Chiaouſes, with free Liberty to all Viſitants whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>There was now no other Rumour or Diſcourſe in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but of a War with <hi>Venice,</hi> ſo ſoon as that with <hi>Perſia</hi> was concluded: And in the mean time the Grand Signior gave Orders, that ten Gallies ſhould be built in his own Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at his Charge, and preſented to the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſes, with condition that they ſhould ſtay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Spring, and accompany his Fleet to Sea. But <hi>Ali Picenin</hi> the Admiral ſuſpecting that this was only a Snare to engage him and his Men for ever in the Grand Signior's Service, refuſed the Obligation, and ſet two Gallies on the Stocks for his own Account.</p>
                  <p>Advice of the Bailo's Confinement being come to <hi>Venice,</hi> with a Report of the Paſſion and Rage of the Sultan, they expected nothing more than a War with the Turk, which they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all Chriſtian Princes, requeſting their Succours and Aſſiſtance againſt the common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Theſe Addreſſes produced rather Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Caſe, than ſubſtantial Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> himſelf giving them great Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of ſome help from the Eccleſiaſtical Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, beſides Proceſſions, Maſſes, and Benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their good Succeſs, in as great a Number as they could deſire: Notwithſtanding which due Care wast taken to make ready and provide againſt all Encounters. Letters were wrote to the Captain-General in the Levant, to make due Preparations againſt the Enemy: Sixteen Gallies were armed out of <hi>Candia,</hi> to which were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Galleaſſes under the Command of <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Piſani</hi> and <hi>Sebaſtiano Veniero:</hi> Souldiers were levied in every Place, and all Garriſons provided with Ammunition and Victuals, and reinforced with Numbers of an Auxiliary Militia. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was not the Buſineſs nor Advantage of the Venetians, to make a War with the Turks, but rather, whilſt they feared the worſt, and made Proviſions againſt the utmoſt Extremities, they endeavoured to enter into Treaties of Peace, and to qualifie the hot Spirit of the Grand Signior with the gentle Lenitives of fair Words, and proffers of making Atonement with the Sacrifice of Gold and other Preſents: In order unto which they wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior to this Effect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That being provoked by the Inſolence and frequent Robberies of the Pirates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> who did not eſteem Faith or Obedience to his Majeſty, nor the Commands which he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fent to reſtrain them, they were induced, out of natural Defence of themſelves, to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe and correct them; but as this was acted without intention to diſoblige his Majeſty, ſo they were ready to maintain and cultivate that ancient Friendſhip and Correſpondence which was ingrafted on the firm Root of his Glorious Progenitors.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Morat,</hi> though he received this Letter in an huff, and gave an Anſwer to it with Diſdain, which breathed nothing but Threats of Revenge, and total Deſtruction; yet he ſent it by an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs of his own to <hi>Venice,</hi> couching ſomething within the Terrour of his Words, as if there was place left for an Accommodation, if the Venetians knew what Salve was to be applied to obduct the Skin of this bleeding Wound. The Venetians quickly apprehended, that Gold was the only Remedy, of which they were ready to contribute freely; ſince they could make no better a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe with their Money than Peace, not could make a better Bargain than with ſuch a Sum as would ſerve only to make the firſt Preparations of War, to evade all Hazards, Troubles, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities by a happy and ſafe Concluſion of Peace. The which notwithſtanding took no Effect, until the Return of <hi>Morat</hi> from <hi>Perſia;</hi> and therefore we ſhall defer Diſcourſe thereof to its proper place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amurat</hi> marched now at the Head of a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Morat</hi> marches to <hi>Perſia.</hi>
                     </note> cloathed in the Habit of a Janiſary, to render himſelf acceptable to the Militia, whom having ſubdued by Rigour and ſevere Diſcipline, he would now oblige by Courteſie and fairer Treatment: With Courage and great Patience he marched through ſandy Deſarts and unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Places; and being the firſt who offered to expoſe himſelf to Dangers and Sufferings, the Souldiery followed willingly his Example, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming no Attempts either hazardous or tedious, in which they ſaw themſelves preceded by their Valiant General. In this March he was overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by one who rode hard to demand <hi>Moſtaluck,</hi> which is the Reward of good News for the Birth of a Son, of which one of his Sultana's was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at <hi>Iſmit:</hi> the Meſſenger was ſecured until the News was confirmed; which being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards turned to the Birth of a Daughter, the poor Man ſuffered Death, being cruelly impaled for his unadviſed haſte and exceſs of officious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards his Ptince.</p>
                  <p>The Great Vizier met his Maſter at <hi>Iconium</hi> with a moderate Equipage, to give more Room for the Quarters of the Army, and rendring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more gracious in his Eyes by a Preſent of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Dollars, he was again remunerated with a Cemiter and a Veſt of Sables, which are the uſual Signals of the Sultan's Favour.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Aſia</hi> was now in Arms, and the Princes and great Men came in to perform their Duty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with their Forces and Attendance: Only Complaints were made of a certain Shegh,<note place="margin">A Shegh rebels.</note> Santone or Preacher belonging to the Mountains of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> who had refuſed to do Homage; or ſerve in the War: He was one, who by a feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Sanctity had acquired a great Reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his People; and having declared himſelf to be the <hi>Mehedy,</hi> or the Mediator, which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Mahometan Doctrine, is to fore-run Antichriſt, for reducing all the World to one Unity of Faith: He had perſwaded his People, that he, and they under him, were by Priviledge of his Office, exempted from all Taxes, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions, or Impoſitions by any Secular Power whatſoever. The Grand Signior who could not underſtand or believe this Doctrine, preſently detached a ſtrong Body with ſome Cannon under Command of the Captain-Paſha (who, as we have ſaid, was to accompany the Grand Signior in the War) to confute the Principies of this Rebel, and to reduce him to Obedience. Theſe Forces being entred on his Dominions, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was made to the People, that they ſhould deliver up their Impoſtor into the hands of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; which if they refuſed to do, then Fire and Sword was to be their Portion,<note place="margin">He is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and puniſhed.</note> and Deſtruction to extend even unto their Children of ſeven years of Age. This terrible Denunciation of the Sultan's Sentence ſtruck all the People with cold Fear and Amazement; howſoever the Shegh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing himſelf on certain Prophecies, which he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:39539:24"/>interpreted in his own Favour, adventured to ſtand a ſhock with the Grand Signior's Forces; but being overcome by them the Shegh was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken alive and carried to the Grand signior; who having given a ſtop to his March at <hi>Iconium,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the end of this Buſineſs, he condemned him to be flead alive; and in this Guiſe being a horrid Spectacle to all Beholders, he was carried upon an Aſs to the Wheel, on which he ſeemed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Remainder of his Puniſhment without any ſenſible Touches or Pangs in the Torments.</p>
                  <p>This Succeſs being attained, <hi>Morat</hi> proceeded in his March, and paſſing through <hi>Alexandretta</hi> or <hi>Scanderone,</hi> he was there ſaluted by the Guns of all the Engliſh and Dutch Ships then in Port, and preſented by the Merchants and Conſuls, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially by the Venetian called <hi>Marco Foſcolo,</hi> whoſe Preſents were computed to amount unto the Value of ten thouſand Dollars. Thence he proceeded to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he refreſhed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for a few days, obſerving the Antiquities of that Place. At <hi>Aleppo</hi> he was met by the Paſha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> who brought with him a rich Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, accompanied with an Army of twenty four thouſand Souldiers, all choice Men well armed and well cloathed; at the ſame Place alſo the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Paleſtine</hi> joyned with him, ſo that his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now increaſed to a vaſt Number. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding forward new Sangiacks came in daily belonging to the Countries through which they marched, and a ſtrong Party of Tartars deſpai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of being able to act any conſiderable Matter againſt <hi>Aſac,</hi> offered themſelves to the Service of the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Perſia</hi> entred the Field at the Head of an hundred and twenty thouſand Horſe;<note place="margin">The Perſian Army dares not give Battel to the Turk.</note> but being inferiour in Force, made only uſe of them to reinforce his Garriſon of <hi>Bagdat</hi> with an Addition of thirty thouſand Men; which now being well provided, he judged that the Force within, and the Strength of the Place would be able to endure a long Siege, and with time wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, if not deſtroy the vaſt numbers of the Turks, of which there were former Examples: With the reſt of his Forces he returned to encounter the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> who (as we have ſaid) promiſed <hi>Morat</hi> to aſſiſt him in this War, and attack the Perſian on the other ſide of his Dominions, which ſerved for an advantageous Diverſion to the Turk. This was the Reaſon that no memorable Battels ſucceeded in the Field, there being none of greater Note than a Fight which <hi>Quinan</hi> Paſha had with two thouſand Perſians belonging to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> with whom accidentally encountring, he killed fifteen hundred of them on the Place, and took the reſt Priſoners, which being five hundred in number were brought before <hi>Morat,</hi> and all barbarouſly put to death by him.</p>
                  <p>During the time of this March, <hi>Morat</hi> often exerciſed himſelf in Feats of Arms, to ſhew his ſtrength of Body and dexterity of Hand; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things wonderful to the Souldiers, he pierced a Suit of Arms of Musket-Proof, with a Dart, called by them a <hi>Gerit,</hi> thrown from his Hand; for evidence of which, the Armour is placed on one of the Gates of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> with an Inſcription under it.</p>
                  <p>About the Beginning of the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the Turkiſh Army paſſed the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Turks paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates.</hi>
                     </note> by means of a Bridge, which was not ſo well built, but that it ſunk under the weight of Horſes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and Baggage, by which Diſaſter many pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the Water, which great Rains had ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led above the Bounds of its Banks. As this nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army proceeded, ſo all Petty Princes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to perform their Homage; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which one Tarpos a King of the Arabs came with his Wife, Mother, and Son to proſtrate himſelf before the Sultan: He was entertained in the Tent of the Favourite, who being always in company with <hi>

In like manner the Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Mengrelians, who are Tributaries to Turk and Perſian, and commonly incline to the ſtrongeſt ſide, whoſe Nations we have deſcribed <hi>in the preſent State of the Ottoman Empire,</hi> would not be wanting at this time to bring their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of eighty thouſand yards of Linen-cloth, which they pay every three year, with ſome Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of both Sexes choſen out of the comelieſt and moſt healthful amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Moſul</hi> the Army lay encamped for ſome time,<note place="margin">The Turkiſh Army at <hi>Moſul.</hi>
                     </note> where was a general Rendezvous and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of People from all Parts, and every thing ordered and modelized for a War. Severe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline was kept amongſt all, Offenders were Impaled, Flead alive, their Bowels ript out, and thrown into the publick Ways: Nor did Takers of Tobacco eſcape with leſs Puniſhment than the reſt. In the mean time Wine was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to his whole Camp, unleſs to himſelf and his Favourite, being a Royal drink; and when the chief Phyſician commended the admirable vertue of Opium, adviſing <hi>Morat</hi> to uſe it in the place of Wine, he enjoyned him to make his Words good by his own Example, and thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to take ſo much, that he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and died by ſwallowing too great a quantity.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Moſul</hi> the Army marched in due order to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Great Vizier arrived with thirty thouſand Men about the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>October:</hi> But by reaſon of the great weight of Artillery, and the many Impediments which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch vaſt numbers, the Grand Signior came not thither till the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and on the <hi>9th</hi> the whole Turkiſh Army preſented it ſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Walls of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Babylon</hi> the ancienteſt City of the World,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Bagdat.</hi>
                     </note> reported to be built by <hi>Nimrod</hi> on the Banks of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and afterwards beautified and enlarged by <hi>Semiramis</hi> the Wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> is recorded in Hiſtory for the vaſtneſs thereof to be one of the ſeven Miracles of the World. Afterwards the furious Inundations of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Iron Teeth of devouring Time, and the ſubjection thereof to the Macedonian Empire, did much eclipſe the Glory of that City, and cauſed <hi>Seleucus Nicanor,</hi> one of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s Captains, to build a new one where the <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> meet, forty Miles more Northwards than the old <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called <hi>Seleucia</hi> after his own Name. In the Year of our Lord 753, <hi>Abugiafer Almanſor,</hi> an Arab King, enlarged this City to the Eaſtern ſide of the <hi>Tigris,</hi> as being leſs ſubject to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of the River, giving it the Name of <hi>Badgat,</hi> or the place of Gardens; but his Son <hi>Almolied</hi> being more pleaſed with the Weſtern ſide, encouraged People to build the ſtatelieſt Palaces and beſt Fabricks near the place where he delighted to keep his Court, ſo that the River <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> divided the City. The which with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try thereabouts was ſubdued by <hi>Solyman</hi> the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent; and afterwards in the Year 1625; it was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:39539:24"/>recovered by <hi>Abas</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> until at length in this of 1638. it was vanquiſhed by the mighty Force and Proweſs of this Magnanimous Sultan, as we ſhall now underſtand.</p>
                  <p>The numerous Troops of the Ottoman Army covering all the Plains,<note place="margin">Bagdat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> a General Council of War was called of the Chief Commanders of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and Spahees, eſpecially of ſuch who had been practiſed in the Sieges of the ſtrong Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in <hi>Hungary.</hi> After ſome Debate and long Conſideration, it was agreed, That the City ſhould be battered in three Places. One Battery of twelve Pieces of Cannon commanded by the Great Vizier was to be erected againſt the Bright Gate; the ſecond againſt the Dark Gate of ten Pieces of Cannon, under the Command of the Captain-Paſha: and a third of eight Pieces direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the Gate of <hi>Perſia,</hi> under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha Beglerbei of <hi>Anatolia.</hi> The Grand Signior in the mean time habited like an ordinary Souldier, that he might be the leſs expoſed to Danger, viſited all Poſts and Places, encouraging them with his Words and Preſence, proteſting that he would not change his Cloaths for ever in any place but within the Walls of <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat.</hi> In the ſpace of three days the Trenches were opened, the Batteries raiſed, and the Cannon planted; and <hi>Morat</hi> having made Korban, gave fire to the firſt Cannot with his own Hand, as he had brought the firſt Basket of Earth to raiſe the Works. The Defendants within conſiſted of eighty thouſand fighting Men, with which they made frequent Sallies of four and five thouſand Men at a time, who being retired, were again ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by another of the like Number, which put the Turkiſh Camp into much Confuſion, and into danger of having their Trenches levelled, and their Cannon ſpiked; but the Turks valiantly fighting, the Slaughter proved bloody on both ſides; and being guided rather by the Bravery of their Courage, than by Art or Experience in in War, they carried their Works forward to the very Brink of the Ditch, having an Italian and a Candiot for their chief Engineers; who though they were not Perſons of that Ability, as our modern Times have produced, yet they were ſuch, as for want of better, ſerved the preſent occaſions, where force and Numbers, with ſmall Additions of Art, were the moſt available. For in this Siege the Sword was more exerciſed than the Spade or Mattock, and there was more need of Arms than Works; for the conſtant Sallies kept the Turks always watchful and imployed, and perpetually diſturbed them, until at length they were forced with great Labour to raiſe a high Circumvallation, with a very deep Ditch, defended by ſeveral Redoubts; whereby the Beſieged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in, thier Numbers decreaſed by former Sallies, and their Courages abated by deſpair of Relief, they began to grow cold in the Acts of Bravery, and to reſerve their Men for the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and laſt Efforts of Defence. In the mean time the Turks plied their Batteries ſo hotly, that in a few days the Walls were laid open almoſt fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paces wide. In this Condition the Defendants having no other Refuge than ſome ſmall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, which they had made during the Siege, were expoſed to the open Force of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. For now the Turks having filled up the firſt and ſecond Ditches with Sacks of Wool, Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, and other Rubbiſh, crowded in vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to enter the Breach, which the Perſians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended as ſtoutly with Stones, Bullets, Artificial Fires, and all Inſtruments of Death, which fell like Showers of Hail on the Heads of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Great Vizier ſignalizing himſelf above all by his undaunted Courage, commanding with his Hand and Voice, was unhappily ſhot by a Musket-bullet, and fell on the heaps of the dead, amongſt whom there is no diſtinction between the common Souldier and the braveſt Captain. This Fight within the Breach continued for five days, where both ſides fighting like Men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, the dead Bodies lay in heaps, and Blood was ſtagnated like a Pool to wade thorough. At length the Numbers of the Turks prevailing, commanded now by <hi>Muſtapha</hi> the Captain-Paſha, entred the Town by force of Arms on the twenty ſecond of <hi>December</hi> about the time of Sun-ſet, when the Royal Standard of the Turks was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this City. Howſoever twenty four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the Perſians remaining ſtill alive, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in a Body, capitulated for Quarter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe threatning not to die unrevenged: Pardon, and Quarter for their Lives was readily granted, on Confidence of which the Perſians threw down their Arms, and ſubmitted to the Publick Faith, or the Sultan's Clemency.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bagdat</hi> taken.</note> But the Grand Signior afterwards conſidering, that the granting Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at <hi>Revan</hi> had been the cauſe of the Loſs of the City, he repented him of his Promiſe, and gave Order to the Janiſaries moſt inhumanely to open a Torrent a Blood, and make a barbarous Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of thoſe who had newly thrown down their Arms at his Feet, not ſparing either Woman or Child, either Sex or Age; the which Slaughter, like a Work of Darkneſs, was acted in the Night by the light of Torches and Lanthorns, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared a horrid Spectacle to all, eſpecially to the Perſian Ambaſſadour, who being conducted like a Priſoner in the Camp, was a ſad Spectator of his Countries Deſtruction on the horrid Theatre of its Capital City.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as <hi>Bagdat</hi> was taken, <hi>Morat</hi> diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away Poſts immediately with the News in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Parts, and wrote a Letter with his own Hand to the Chimacam, ordering a <hi>Dunalma</hi> or Feaſt of Thankſgiving, and rejoicing for the ſpace of twenty Days; during which time no Buſineſs was to be acted, the Houſes were to be adorned both without and within with the beſt Furniture, and every Houſe was to ſet forth Lights, Torches, and Fire-works agreeable to the Condition and Ability of the Perſon. The People exclaimed hereat as too great an Expence, and the Vacation from Buſineſs ſeemed too long for thoſe who lived by their daily Labour. The chief Miniſters and Grandees evidenced external actions of Joy, but inwardly feared and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſuſpecting that the fierce and cruel Humour of their Sultan would be elated, and rendred more tyrannical and untractable by Succeſs and a favourable Fortune. The Chriſtian Princes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Intelligence like bad News, and as an Alarm to awaken then from the eaſineſs of Peace, to expectations of War: For War with <hi>Perſia</hi> was like an Ulcer in the Bowels of the Turkiſh Empire, which gangreen'd and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Strength and Marrow of their Power; which now being cured, and the Body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick rendred healthy by ſuch a ſeaſonable Succeſs, would convert it ſelf to Enterpriſes pernicious and dangerous to the neighbouring States.</p>
                  <p>After the Conqueſt of this City, <hi>Morat</hi> gave out, That he reſolved to procced with his Army into <hi>Perſia,</hi> and to enter the Walls of <hi>Spahan;</hi> but having ſome indiſpoſitions of Health upon him, and recalled by the charming Letters of a Favourite Miſtreſs, whom he had left at <hi>Diarbechir,</hi> he inclined to return again to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi> Wherefore muſtering firſt his Army,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:39539:25"/>he found that it was abated near an hundred thouſand Men, two thirds whereof being killed in the War, the reſt periſhed by the Peſtilence, and other Diſeaſes and Maladies incident to Camps; a great part of the Slaughter fell on the moſt veterane Souldiers of the Janiſaries and Spahees, of which many of the Chief being ſlain, their Lands and Revenues returned to the Grand Signior, and gave him both Opportunity and Ability to reward many with ſuch Offices and Gifts as came by the Death and Fall of other Commanders. Thus the Captain-Paſha, whoſe Valour had rendred him Famous, was made Great Vizier in the place of him that was ſlain, and the Perſian Favourite was conſtituted Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha; and though many repined at this Advancement, as conferred on a Stranger, and a Perſon without Merit, yet the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior conſidered him as one whoſe Experience in that Country, and the Information he had given him of the Scituation and Strength of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had made abundant Compenſation for the Favour and Honour he had beſtowed upon him.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior having left a Gariſon of thirty thouſand Men in <hi>Bagdat,</hi> diſpatched the Great Vizier with a conſiderable Army to penetrate far into the Country of <hi>Perſia.</hi> And having now releaſed the Perſian Ambaſſadour, giving him liberty to return to his Maſter, wrote by him this braving Letter.</p>

                  <p>This Letter being diſpatched, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior recalled the forty thouſand Men which he had lent, from the Service of the Great <hi>Mogul,</hi> which he quartered about <hi>Bagdat</hi> to hinder the Attempts of the Perſians, in caſe they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to purſue him in the Rear, and diſturb his return into <hi>Europe.</hi> By reaſon of the Rigour and Extremity of the Winter, and a certain Defluxion which falling on his Nerves, made him ſomething Paralytical,<note place="margin">The Grand Signior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </note> the Grand Signior depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not from <hi>Bagdat</hi> until the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> and then for recovery of his Health, and to ſoil the Horſes by the way with convenience of Graſs, ſhort Days Journeys were appointed.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Signior's Indiſpoſition encreaſing, with ſome cold and ſhivering Fits, gave the firſt Symptoms of a Feaver; but afterwards it plainly appearing to be a paralytical Diſtemper, ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Phyſicians to end in an Apoplexy, it was rumoured abroad, that <hi>Morat</hi> was dead; but it was whiſpered with ſuch Caution, as if they had feared leſt the Grand Signior would have over-heard them, and riſen from his Grave to puniſh their ſecret and inward Joy. Being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what recovered from the laſt Acceſſion of his Palſie, the Humour fell into his Legs, and ſwelled ſo much, that he could ſcarce ſit upon his Horſe; howſoever he haſtened as faſt as he could to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to diſprove and confute the falſity of that Report concerning his Death.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time it is not to be expreſſed with what Fear and Terrour the Chimacam and other great Miniſters of State expected the return of their formidable Prince, not knowing where the Thunderbolt of his cruel Diſpoſition would ſtrike, until at length it fell on the Head of the poor Sultan <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> whoſe weakneſs, as it ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred him unable for Government and Command, ſo it made him ſtupid and inſenſible of Death.</p>
                  <p>At length on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Grand Signior's Entry into <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </note> The Favourite <hi>Soltana,</hi> which had accompanied him to the War, paſſed by Water from <hi>Iſmit</hi> attended with ſix Gallies, and took her Lodging the firſt Night of her arrival at a ſmall Chiosk or Houſe of Pleaſure under the Wall, ſo as to make a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Entry the Day following. Her Coach was covered with Cloth of Gold, and the Spokes of the Wheels were gilded, and the Wheels ſhod with Silver; ſhe was followed by twelve Coaches, and the Mufti, Paſha's, Kadees, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers went before to conduct her to the Seraglio. The Grand Signior, who arrived the ſame Day, attended with fifty ſix Gallies, made not his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Entry until two Days after, being perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Ceremony, State, and Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which could be contrived. The Grand Signior in his own Perſon appeared in the Perſian Habit, with a Leopard's Skin thrown over his Shoulders, after the manner of a Kauſee (as they call them) or a brave huffing Champion, having his Stirrup attended with twenty two of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Nobles, whom he had reſerved at <hi>Bagdat,</hi> purpoſely to lead in Triumph when he made this Entry. The Treaſure brought to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was landed at the Seraglio out of ten Gallies, and calculated to amount to a greater Sum than that which was carried from thence; for beſides the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:39539:25"/>Riches taken in the Plunder of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſeiſure was mad in divers places of the Eſtates of Paſha's and other Great Men, which by Death, or for Crimes, eſcheated to the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>After the Grand Signior's Departure out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> little of Action ſucceeded, as if by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Agreement, a Truce or Ceſſation of Arms had been contrived. The Perſians deſired a Peace, becauſe they were enfeebled and tired with the War: The Turks had regained their Honour by the Conqueſt of <hi>Badgat;</hi> and being unwilling to loſe it by change of unconſtant Fortune, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſume their Riches and Men in a tedious and remote March, were attending to receive Propoſitions of Peace firſt offered by the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. To effect which the Great Vizier, who was left at <hi>Badgat</hi> to command the Army, intimated to the Governours of the Frontiers, that a prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of Peace ſhould be accepted;<note place="margin">An Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador ſent from <hi>Perſia</hi> to the Grand Signior.</note> which being made known to the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpatched an Ambaſſadour to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to propoſe Terms of Accommodation. The Ambaſſadour being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was grateful and acceptable to all, and his Day of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience appointed after the uſual manner on the Pay-day of the Janiſaries, when the Floor of the Divan is covered with Sacks of Mony; before the Door of the Chamber of Audience ſtood the Perſian Captives all cloathed in rich Veſts. The Ambaſſadour being conducted to the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with the uſual Ceremonies (of which we have given an Account in another place) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Sultan ſitting upon a Saffaw cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Crimſon Velvet, embroidered with Pearl; his Turbant was encompaſſed with a Chain of Diamonds, cloathed with a rich Veſt lined with Sables; he caſt no Pleaſantneſs of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect on the Ambaſſadour, but beholding him with a fierce and ſcornful Look, received the Letter in a kind of careleſs Diſdain, behaving himſelf in every Motion, as if he neither eſteemed the King, nor his Ambaſſadour; or as if the Perſian had been wholly conquered by him, had ſent to beg Peace, and Pardon for his Life: The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour was ſoon diſmiſſed from his Preſence; and matters being referred to the Negotiation of the Chimacam, no other difficulty aroſe beſides the Diſpute concerning <hi>Revan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Peace concluded.</note> which at length was agreed by another Ambaſſadour ſent to the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on the Frontiers to remain unto the Perſian, as <hi>Bagdat</hi> was confirmed to the Turk: And ſo Peace was without long Debate clapt up; the Grand Signior, by reaſon of his Indiſpoſition which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed upon him, being not inclinable to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his Head with the Burden of Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Peace being thus concluded with <hi>Perſia,</hi> there appeared a perfect Sun-ſhine and fair Weather in the Ottoman Court, neither Diſſenſions at home, nor Wars abroad troubling the Quiet and Repoſe of the Sultan: Until ſome Differences happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning between the Princes of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia</hi> exhaled the firſt Cloud of Diſturbance. At that time <hi>Lupulo</hi> was Prince of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of evil Principles, covetous, and unjuſt. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> was Prince of <hi>Walachia,</hi> a good Man, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Chriſtian Religion, and one who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred equal Juſtice to his People. <hi>Lupulo</hi> not, contenting himſelf with his own, but deſirous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of his Neighbours Poſſeſſion,<note place="margin">Troubles in <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia.</hi>
                     </note> made inſtances to the Port to have the Principality of <hi>Moldavia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon his Son, alledging that thereby he ſhould be better enabled to balance the Power of <hi>Ragotski</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and on all occaſions be rendred more ſerviceable to the Grand Signior's Deſigns and Intereſt: And ſeconding this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with a Preſent of fifty thouſand Dollars to the Chimacam, and promiſe to increaſe the annual Tribute, he obtained the Chimacam's Friendſhip, at whoſe Inſtance the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was perſwaded to write unto <hi>Matthew</hi> to ſurrender up his Province into the hands of the Son of <hi>Lupulo;</hi> declaring, That it having been accuſtomary to change the Princes of thoſe Countries every three years, he ought after an Injoyment of above ſeven years to content himſelf with a quiet and voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation, unleſs he would deſire to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf a Ruin by the Anger and Diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Sultan. <hi>Matthew</hi> having no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, reſolved not to ſurrender his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but with his Life; and having a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Animoſity againſt <hi>Lupulo,</hi> could by no means incline his Mind to make his Enemy happy with the Spoils of his Eſtate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having obtained Aſſiſtance from <hi>Ragotski,</hi> he reſolved to withſtand the Forces of young <hi>Lupulo,</hi> and engage with him: And being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to mount on Horſe-back, and begin the Battel, he firſt diſpatched an humble Meſſage to the Grand Signior, acquainting him, <q>That he was ready at his Command to reſign his Principality into the Hands of the meaneſt Greek his Majeſty would appoint; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Source of all Equity and Juſtice, he hoped that he would not oblige him to ſuch Terms as would raiſe his Mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my upon his Ruin; a Man ſo intent to his own Intereſts, and ſo unconſcionable to compaſs them, that all late Revolutions, Wars, and Commotions have been raiſed either by him, or by his Inſtruments.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Letter being received and read by the Grand Signior, was ſeconded in a few hours after, with News of the total Defeat of young <hi>Lupulo;</hi> which put the Grand Signior ſo much into choler, that he immediately committed the Chimacam to the ſeven Towers, for being the Projector and Author of this Counſel. It was ſuppoſed however, that <hi>Morat</hi>'s Anger would not proceed to that degree, as to extend to his Life; but being informed, that he was rich, and that he was poſſeſſed of two Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Dollars, which lay by him in ready Mony, it was concluded, that ſo vaſt a Wealth could not in a ſhort time be honeſtly gained; which appearing as an undeniable Evidence and Teſtimony of his Violence and Oppreſſion, the Grand Signior made no Difficulty to paſs the Sentence of Death againſt him,<note place="margin">The Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam put to Death.</note> nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the Mony to his own Exchequer: His Office was given to <hi>Sinan</hi> Paſha, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality confirmed unto <hi>Matthew.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>During all this Time, the Quarrel which the Turks conceived againſt the Venetians, for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating their Port of <hi>Valona,</hi> was not yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; but now having time to peruſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider old Accounts, the Venetian Bailo was called by the Chimacam to Audience, and to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him concerning this Matter. In the firſt place therefore the Bailo alledged, <q>That the Pirates of <hi>Barbary</hi> had for the ſpace of twenty Years roved in the Venetian Gulf, and made Prize in that time of ſo many Ships and Goods belonging to Merchants, that the Republick had been prejudiced by them in ſeveral Millions; which alſo did in ſome manner prejudice the Cuſtoms of the Grand Signior, to whom the Venetian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants pay for the moſt part yearly the Sum of an hundred thouſand Dollars in Cuſtom for their Goods, beſides the benefit which the Ottoman Dominions receive by ſo profitable a Commerce.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:39539:26"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hereunto the Chimacam replied:</hi> 
                     <q>That the damages which the Turks received by the Corſairs or Free-booters at Sea under the Colours of <hi>Malta, Leghorn, Majorca,</hi> and other places, were greater and more diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to the Majeſty of the Ottoman Grandeur, than the depredations of the other ſide were to <hi>Venice:</hi> And therefore it would be neceſſary for the good of the World, that ſuch Violences were prevented in all places: and that Men of ſuch wicked Profeſſion ſhould be eſteemed for univerſal Enemies, and to have no other Quarter, nor Articles grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, than what we give to wild and hurtful Beaſts, whom we deſtroy by Snares and Gins, and all Advantages. The which alſo was never denied to the Venetians, whilſt they encountred and took them in the open Seas; but to enter into priviledged Places, and violate a Sanctuary of the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's, without reſpect to the mighty Power of ſo dreadful a Monarch, was an act ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as could never obtain Pardon without due Compenſation for the Offence; which could not be done, but either by a Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Veſſels, or elſe of a like Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the places of them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hereunto the Bailo replied:</hi> 
                     <q>That if an Accommodation could not be made on other Terms, nor Peace maintained, but by a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Pyrats, and ſupportation of all their Injuries and Robberies, a War muſt inevitably enſue; for the good ſucceſs of which they depended on the Bleſſing of God Almighty, and the general Aſſiſtance of all Chriſtendom, which will eſteem it ſelf uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally concerned in this Cauſe, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as well to make good this Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pirates, as to preſerve <hi>Venice</hi> for their main Bulwark and Defence againſt the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Force.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>You make me Smile (anſwered the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam) when you tell me of the Power of Chriſtendom, which contains nothing more of Terrour than the Name. Do not I know, who have been Paſha of <hi>Buda,</hi> that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour hath no Mony; and that when the Sweeds, a ſmall and inconſiderable People, have made War upon him, they have almoſt over-run his Country? As for <hi>France,</hi> if they underſtand their own Politicks, they will ſcarce be perſwaded to lend aſſiſtance to the Empire, when we make War againſt it. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> have ſo much to do at Home, and to conſerve themſelves from the Incroachments of their powerful Neighbour the French, that they are wholly unable to lend Forces to wage a War at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from their Dominions. Wherefore conſidering the Advantage we have upon you, which we well know and underſtand; you muſt either have War on theſe hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Terms, or elſe purchaſe your Peace with a conſiderable Sum of Mony. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of which Bargain you muſt conſider, that you have to deal with a mighty Prince, and not with a Merchant; and therefore your Offer ought to be large at firſt, ſo as it may gain Credit, and be received with a favourable Ear; for a ſmall Sum to him is like a little Morſel given to an hungry Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, which ſerves only to increaſe the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. And you know, that we our ſelves are often forced to ſacrifice to the Avarice of our Prince, by effuſions of vaſt Sums of Money, which are always beſt compounded for, when they are done readily, and at firſt, before we give our Maſter time to conſult with his Pillow, and to make up our Accounts according to the Calculation of his own Reckoning. Let me therefore exhort you to follow the like Example, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately make an Offer of three hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Zechins of Gold, which if you will do, and employ my Intereſt to make this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for you, I hope, though with ſome difficulty, to gain its acceptance. To talk and reaſon of Things paſt is but to beat the Air, becauſe the time is vaniſhed and gone; but you may conſider of the preſent, that you may ſecure the future. We ſell you Peace at this Price; if it be worth your Mony, take it; if not, refuſe it, as you judge the Purchaſe moſt agreeable to your Intereſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time Chriſtendom was embroiled in its uſual Combuſtions, ſo that Aſſiſtance from other Princes was not only uncertain, but without all Foundation; ſo that the Venetians could have no ſure Truſt to any other than their own Force. In regard that many were deſirous at that time to ſee the Venetians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with the Turk, that ſo they might not be able to concern themſelves in the War of <hi>Italy,</hi> which then grew hot by rhe Wars of <hi>Savoy, Modena,</hi> and <hi>Matoua,</hi> favoured by the Protection of the Spaniards, by whoſe means all the Differences aroſe about the Valtoline. Conſidering which, the wiſe Senate being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to purchaſe ſo great a Bleſſing to their Country by a moderate Price, gave Liberty to their Bailo to compound for it at what rate and terms he was able; which by the Bailo's Dexterity in the Management, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded for the Sum of two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Zechins, which was eſteemed for a great Service, and redounded much to the Reputation of the Bailo: after which Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the former Articles were ratified, and theſe which follow added thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That the Ambaſſadour or Bailo ſhould be ſet at Liberty, and permitted to return to his own Habitation: That Commerce be renewed as formerly between the Subjects of both Countries: That all Controverſie about the Maters happened at <hi>Valona,</hi> for ever be ſilenced and forgotten. When at any time the Pirats of <hi>Barbary</hi> ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to enter within the Ports of the Grand Signior, they ſhall give Security, that they will commit no Damage or Spoil on the Subjects of <hi>Venice.</hi> And in caſe they ſhall have taken any Prizes belonging to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid State, they ſhall not be admitted nor protected in the Ports belonging to the Grand Signior. Wherefore in virtue hereof all Aga's, Captains of Caſtles, and other Miniſters who ſhall not obey and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Capitulation, ſhall be deprived of their Office; and if the Venetians ſhall then enter violently into the Port, where ſuch Enemies have taken Refuge, it ſhall not be imputed to them for a Crime, or eſteemed a Breach of the Capitulations. And farther, if the Venetians ſhall at any time encounter the aforeſaid People of <hi>Barbary</hi> in the open Sea, it ſhall be lawful for them to aſſault, take, and deſtroy them without notice, or exceptions of the Ottoman Port. And laſtly, the new Bailo lately elected, ſhall pay unto the Grand Signior five hundred thouſand Pieces of Eight, which make two

                  <p>The Baron <hi>Chinski</hi> arrived at that time from the Emperour in Quality of Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,<note place="margin">An Envoy ſent from the Emperor to the Grand Signior.</note> to congratulate the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's Succeſs in taking <hi>Bagdat,</hi> and making a Peace with <hi>Perſia;</hi> but not bringing with him Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to that value, which on this occaſion were expected, he was not looked on, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with that Favour and Reſpect, as was agreeable to his Character and Quality. And there happening a Diſpute between this Envoy and the Engliſh Ambaſſadour concerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency of place; the Turks yielded it to the Engliſh, being made to underſtand the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which Chriſtian Princes make between the Title of an Ambaſſadour and that of an Envoy, though the Turks uſe but that one word of <hi>Elchi</hi> to expreſs both. And though the Baron <hi>Chinski</hi> laboured to diminiſh the Dignity of an Engliſh Ambaſſadour at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> by alledging, that he was elected by the Company of Merchants for Conſervation of their Trade only, and afterwards confirmed and honoured by the King: yet this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was in no wiſe prevalent with the Turks, who eſteeming the Commiſſion of the Prince, and the Charge of an Office the only Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ennoble a Perſon, made no Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to determine the Point in behalf of the Engliſh. And though ſome Italian Writers ſay, that the Engliſh Ambaſſadour gave fifteen Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Mony, or ſeven thouſand five hundred Dollars to the Chimacam for this Favour; yet thoſe who underſtand how unwillingly the <hi>Turky</hi>-Merchants part with their Mony on defence of ſuch Punctillio's and Niceties, eſpecially where the Ambaſſadour might have avoided the bringing them into Diſpute, will more readily believe, that the Turks from free motives of their own Juſtice and Reaſon judged this Honour due to the Ambaſſador, than that he ſhould purchaſe this indiſputable Point by the diſgraceful means of Mony.</p>
                  <p>All matters being now determined between the Turks and <hi>Perſia,</hi> and the black Clouds blown over from the Venetians,<note place="margin">The Turkiſh Counſels un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a War.</note> the Grand Signior ſtudied how and where he might turn his Arms with moſt Advantage: he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an irreconcileable pique againſt <hi>Ragotski</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> for the Cauſes before related; but having an intention to make uſe of their Force againſt <hi>Poland</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or againſt them both together, he diſſembled the Paſſion he conceived againſt them, and rather defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Revenge, than pardoned the Liberty which they had exerciſed without his Licence or Aſſent. Sometimes he reſolved to recover <hi>Aſac</hi> out of the hands of the Coſſacks; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he thought of making War upon <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> judging himſelf much affronted by that King, for not ſending an Ambaſſadour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his late Succeſſes: Then he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that a War in <hi>Germany</hi> would be more eaſie, and the Conqueſt more profitable by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Riches of the People, and the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soil, to which pretences could never be wanting on the ſcore of thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which always ariſe amongſt the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Frontiers.

                     </note> To command them the Great Vizier was ordered to haſten his Journey from <hi>Perſia,</hi> whoſe Arrival was celebrated at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with a ſolemn En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and for a particular and diſtinguiſhing Honour, the Grand Signior ſent him a Veſt from his own Back to wear on the day of his Triumph. This Vizier was a Perſon very au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere in his Behaviour, bold and valiant, as he evidenced by his Actions in taking <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat,</hi> zealous for his Maſter's Intereſt; and, what is rare in a Turk, not much addicted to his own: He had acquired a great ſhare in the Eſteem of his Maſter, and his Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty increaſed, as the daily Decay of the Grand Signior's Health rendred him leſs able for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For now the ſtrong Complexion of <hi>Morat</hi> began to grow feeble by exceſſes of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Debauchery, his Stomach was become cold and weak, not able to digeſt the lighteſt Meats, his hand ſhook, and a paralytical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper ſeized him in every part; ſo that his Mother and the Phyſicians perſwaded him to forſake the uſe of Wine, as Poyſon and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to his Health; and he, whilſt he was ſenſible of his languiſhing Condition, like a true Penitent, made many Proteſtations and Vows againſt it, forbidding the accurſed Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be received within the Walls of the Seraglio: Howſoever his kind Heart could not poſſibly withſtand the Temptation of a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, to which his Pot-companions did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times invite him; amongſt which the Great Vizier would not be wanting alſo to pleaſe and cajole the Humour of his Maſter with the Liquor that he loved. But his chief and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Camerades in drinking were his Perſian Favourite, and <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Paſha of <hi>Boſna,</hi> one educated in the Seraglio, promoted to the place of Selictar Aga, to whom he gave the ſtately Palace of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha on the <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome,</hi> together with his eldeſt Daughter in Marriage. Theſe two ſtout Sons of <hi>Bacchus</hi> perſwaded the Grand Signior to appoint one ſolemn Drinking-day in time of the Biram, which is the great Feſtival of the Year, and introduced by their Prophet in imitation of our <hi>Eaſter. Morat</hi> being at this time poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Spirit of Debauchery, accepted the Motion, and invited the two Drunkards to dinner with him. The Perſian provoked his Pleaſure of drinking by ſalt Meats, and by peppered and ſpiced Diſhes; the ſort of Wine they moſt uſed, was a ſweet Malvoiſia, ſometimes twiſted, and encouraged with the ſtrong Waters, called <hi>Roſa Solis,</hi> of which they ſucked ſo long, and with ſuch Exceſs, that falling under the force of it, they were inſenſibly carried away to their ſeveral Beds. This diſſolute Repaſt became fatal to the Grand Signior; for a Fire being kindled in his Veins and Bowels, he fell into a violent and continued Feaver. The Phyſicians being called, were fearful to adminiſter Remedies, leſt proving unſucceſsful, their Lives ſhould pay for the ineffectual Operation: At length they agreed to let him blood,<note place="margin">The death of Sultan <hi>Morat.</hi>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:39539:27"/>which his youthful Years enabled him to ſupport.

He left no Son; for though he had divers, they died in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, notwithſtanding which his Kingred were ſo deteſted by him, that he envied the Deſcendence of Monarchy on his Brother <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahim,</hi> who was preſerved by a ſtrange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence from his Fury: Often ſaying, that he wiſhed that he might be the laſt of the Ottoman Line, that the Empire of that Family might end with him, and devolve unto the Tartar.

He was very inquiſitive into all Actions of the City, for which he maintained his Spies, and oftentimes took his Rules and Meaſures from Diſcourſes of People concerning his Government.

State.</note> His Mother, called <hi>Kioſem,</hi> comforted her ſelf with the thoughts thather Son <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> ſtill lived, and was the ſole Surviver, and undoubted Heir of the Ottoman Family. To whoſe Succeſſion, that ſhe might make the more facile and undiſturbed Entrance, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with all the Viziers, requeſting their Conſent and Aſſiſtance, in the lawful promotion of her remaining Son to the Throne of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors: For ſhe had underſtood, that <hi>Morat,</hi> who always abhorred the ill-ſhap'd Body, and weaker Mind of his Brother, envied him the Dignity of the Ottoman Scepter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had bequeathed the Succeſſion to the Tartar, having, in the Heat of a Debauch, and Fumes of Wine, compelled his Paſha's to ſwear to the performance of his Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Queen, aſſembling them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with gentle Words, deſired them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, That <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was the Lawful Heir, and their true Emperor; that the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> was a Stranger, odious to the Souldiery, and not beloved by the People: that an Alteration of this Nature could never be contrived and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, without danger to the Actors; and that they, to whom ſhe aſſured the continuance of the ſame Honours and Offices, in Reward of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Allegiance, would be in hazard of loſing all, by the coming of a Foreign Prince, who having Confidents of his own to prefer, and grand Neceſſities to ſatisfy, would make bold even with Eſtates and Provinces to prefer his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites, his Kindred, and Country-Men, and eſtabliſh the firmneſs of his Government on their Ruin. Yet, ſetting aſide thoſe Conſiderations, touching their own Safety and Intereſt, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, That if they would reach out their Hands unto her Son, for to lift him unto the Throne, he ſhould acknowledg his Empire from them, and accordingly love, tender, and eſteem ſuch faithful Subjects.</p>
                  <p>The Viziers, after ſome Reflections on the Tye and Obligation which Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> had cauſed them to make to him, declared, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it to be unlawful, and void; proteſting, That they were reſolved to maintain inviolable the Allegiance they owed unto Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> deſcended from the Ottoman Blood, which they reverenced and adored, with an Awe equal to the Religious Eſteem which their Fore-fathers had of it; and therefore, with one Voice they cried out, <hi>Let Sultan</hi> Ibrahim <hi>live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Herewith the Council breaking up, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, accompanied with all the Officers and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of the Seraglio, went with Shouts and loud Acclamations, to the Priſon of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to ſalute him Emperor; for he, poor Prince, had now for four Years remained a ſad Recluſe in a dark Room, where he had received neither Light nor Air, but what came from a little Window, which ſometimes in favour was opened to him from Above; and what was worſe, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expectations, and fear of Death, without Friends, Converſation, or Hope, rendred thoſe Apprehenſions worſe than Death it ſelf; which daily were repreſented to him in that Solemnity, as might terrify a Mind more conſtant and firm than his.</p>
                  <p>So ſoon as he heard the Shouts and Voices of a Multitude near his Door, he immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Fate was now come which he had ſo long expected, and therefore he barred his Door, and denied to give Entrance: And when the Viziers proclaimed him Emperor, (fearing it might be ſome Artifice of his Brother,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:39539:28"/>to ſee with what Joy he would entertain the News) he anſwered, That he did not ſo much as think of the Empire, nor deſire it, but only prayed that Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> might live, to whom he pretended not to be a Brother, but a Slave: And when he perceived that they began to force the Door, though with terms of Reſpect and Obſervance, he ſtill endeavoured to keep it cloſe; for Nature had taught him to conſerve a Life, for Nature had taught him to conſerve a Life, howſoever Miſerable, and void of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                  <p>He continuing thus reſolute not to open, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to his Perſon commanded them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any ruder Violence; until the Queen-Mother over-hearing all this Stir, deſcended her ſelf in Perſon; and firſt cauſing the dead Corps of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Morat</hi> to be extended before his Door, with gentle Compellations, and confident Aſſurances, averred the Death of his Brother. The Voice of his Mother began to diſſipate the Fears, and being in part already convinced by his Ears, he adventured to peep at the Door, and giving then entire Credence to his Eyes, his Heart and Spirits conſented to revive; and ſ retiring back into his Chamber, he willingly received the Congratulations of the Miniſters and Souldiers; which being paſt, he readily applied his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Coffin of his dead Brother; and having bore his ſhare of that dear Burden to the Gate of the Seraglio, he there reſigned it to his Domeſtick Officers, who buried him in the Sepulchre of Sultan <hi>Achmet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From thence he took Boat, and paſſed to the Moſch of <hi>Jub</hi>'s Seraglio, where in the ſpace of eight days, he compleated all the Ceremonies of his Coronation; and afterwards, according to the Cuſtom of his Anceſtors, he rode through the City to his great Palace; but whether it were for want of practice, or by reaſon of a Poſture natural unto Fools, he fat ſo ridiculouſly on his Saddle, as moved rather the Laughter than the Acclamation of the People.</p>
                  <p>In fine, being entred the Seraglio, he began to breath, and enjoy the Air of Liberty, with ſo much contentment and ſatisfaction, that he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly would empair the leaſt Particle of his late acquired Freedom, by thinking, or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Buſineſs, and as if he enjoyed ſufficient, committed all to the management of his Mother; howſoever, being deſirous to handle ſomething of the Government, he did it with ſo little Grace and Dexterity, that it plainly appeared, that that Soul animated a Body not fit to ſway or wield a Scepter.</p>
                  <p>The Queen-Mother, to maintain the Word ſhe had given to the Viziers, continued them all in their reſpective Offices; ſo that, though there was great diſproportion in the Mind of the two Princes, yet the Miniſters being the ſame, there ſeemed to be little or no Alteration in the Government.</p>
                  <p>The Great Vizier remembring well the thoughts of War which Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> meditated againſt the Coſſacks, and being deſirous of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and continuance of his Power, reſolved to proſecute the ſame Deſign, hoping to meet a Spirit in <hi>Ibrahim</hi> equal to the Generoſity of his Brother.<note place="margin">Reaſons for a War with the Coſſaks.</note> To this War many and various were the Motives; as firſt, A natural deſire of Revenge on the Coſſacks, for having infeſted the Black Seas, that they might thereby provoke <hi>Poland</hi> to a War, which when they had reduced to ſome Extremity, the Emperor would conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall in to their Aſſiſtance, and thereby create Quarrels, which muſt neceſſarily open a large Field of Troubles; which being ſown with the Seed of Diſcord, could not fail to produce Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Pretentions for a War.</p>
                  <p>It being thus reſolved, to which the Vizier nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wanted Eloquence nor Reaſons to perſwade, great Preparations were made for a War, which was intended to be maintained for many Years: During which time, God, who diſpoſes all Things at his Pleaſure, permitted a falſe Report to fly, that the Perſians were providing a great Army to beſiege <hi>Bagdat;</hi> to which the Turks giving entire Credence, it was reſolved in the Divan, that thoſe Preparations againſt Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſhould be diverted towards the Parts of the Eaſtern Countries. By this vain Rumour only were all theſe Grand Deſigns diſappointed, and all farther Thoughts vaniſhed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of moleſting the Chriſtians. From whence it is obſervable, how neceſſary are the Foreign Reſidences of Miniſters, and how abſurdly the Turks err; who, by reaſon of their Pride, vouchſafe not to entertain Ambaſſadors in the Courts of Strangers, being beholden to the Jews, or Armenian-Merchants for all their Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they receive touching the Affairs of Neighbouring Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>The Wars being thus ſuſpended, the Great Vizier had time to caſt his Eyes about him, and contrive the Ruin of ſuch whom he ſuſpected moſt dangerous to his Condition. Amongſt the reſt, none appeared more formidable than <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> Paſha, Captain-Paſha, a young brisk Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Favourite of the Queen-Mother, whom to remove was difficult and dangerous, being a Vizier as well as he, and in one of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Degrees of Dignity in the whole Empire: And therefore that he might touch him with ſmooth and gentle Terms, he practiſed upon him the ordinary Decoy of Preferment, prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him the Government of <hi>Buda;</hi> which whilſt the one ſeemed out of modeſty to refuſe, the other with the greater force of Complement, and obliging expreſſions of Friendſhip, preſſed him to accept. At length, overcome with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and kindneſs, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> received the Proffer; whereby being diveſted of the Queen's Protection, he was ſoon after overtaken in his Journey towards his Principality, and by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mandate required to take his way to the Province of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> the ſmalleſt, and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable of the Empire: in which he was no ſooner inveſted, than a ſecond Edict took off his Head.</p>
                  <p>But another <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> more fortunate, was ſent Paſha to <hi>Grand Cairo</hi> in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> he was a mortal Enemy to the <hi>Crim Tartar,</hi> of whom he ſhewed his hatred at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> by putting his Son to Death, for having ſaid, That Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> and Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> dying without Iſſue, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was to deſcend to his Family. This Son of Tartar was then at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> it being a Cuſtom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have one of them as a Hoſtage for the Father's obedient Comportment towards the Turks, their place of Reſidence being either at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> or ſome Town on the Black Sea, as we have elſewhere declared.</p>
                  <p>The Sultan in this Interim had little regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Government, both for want of Capacity, and by reaſon of his luxurious and wanton Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, the which he indulged in the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Senſuality; for having been accuſtomed to a Priſon, and Reſtraint, he knew not how to enjoy that freedom he had recovered, but by ſubjecting it to the imperious ſervitude of his Luſts. This Humor the Vizier and great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cheriſhed in him, by continual Banquets, Feaſs, and Entertainments, in which he always
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39539:28"/>took high contentment and ſatisfaction. His other Recreations were, Horſe-races, and Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Bow, rewarding the moſt dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Archers. Buſineſs was a Stranger to him, he knew not what it meant, nor thought there was other Employment for the Emperor than to ſtudy thoſe Paſtimes, which moſt correſponded with his Youth and Nature: only the Vizier would ſometimes, in Matters of high Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, demand his Aſſent, which was either out of formality, or elſe to ſecure himſelf with the Name and Authority of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>The News of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s promotion to the Throne being arrived at <hi>Venice,</hi> the moſt ſerene Republick diſpatched <hi>Pietro Foſcarini</hi> as their Ambaſſador Extraordinary to complement the Sultan.<note place="margin">Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ſent to complement Sultan <hi>Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahim</hi>
                     </note> The Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> in like manner ſent his Tribute, which was ſome Hawks, and twelve Veſſels of Gilded Plate, as feudatary Acknowledgments for the Lands held, and for his Confirmation in the Principality.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters of other Princes having paſſed the like Addreſſes, which were cuſtomary, the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Poland</hi> made Complaints of the Tartars, whoſe Incurſions againſt them, the Turks, by Conditions of Peace, were obliged to reſtrain; but in this, as in other Occaſions ſince that time, the Poles could obtain no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from the Turks, who willing to have the Chriſtians oppreſſed or ruined, either ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to give Credit to the Subject of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, or elſe to find out Excuſes to acquit the Tartar; which being ſo known and common a Practice with the Turk, it is to be wondred why the Poles have ſent ſo many late Meſſages of this Nature, which in former, as well as in this preſent Age, have proved fruitleſs; a pregnant Example of which we ſhall find in the Reign of Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Son of this <hi>Ibrahim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongſt other Corruptions theſe Times, Aſpers were ſo cut and clipt, that the Dollar roſe from eighty to an hundred and twenty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers; which Irregularity being complained of in the Divan, all Monies were reduced to their intrinſick Value; and the Aſpers called in to be coined in the Mint, to the great Damage of the People.</p>
                  <p>But this Matter will not appear ſtrange, if it be compared to the Vellion of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Permiſſion in <hi>Turkey,</hi> of the baſe Alloy of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins, by which never any Nation before was ever ſo cheated and abuſed.</p>
                  <p>And now the Storms of War, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from <hi>Perſia,</hi> being blown over, it was judged ſeaſonable to reaſſume the thoughts of War ſo long meditated againſt the Coſſacks: In order unto which, Gallies were commanded to be built, which ſhould draw little Water, and purpoſely made to paſs the Shoals on the Black Sea near <hi>Aſac,</hi> for the recovery of that Place out of the Hands of the Enemy. Another Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron alſo of Gallies was deſigned for the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago,</hi> to oppoſe the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which much infeſted thoſe Seas.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt Enterpriſe, the Tartar much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Turk, by reaſon that <hi>Aſac</hi> did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder his Incurſions by Land, but rendred his Navigation in the Black Seas very unſecure. To the ſecond, The Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked them, under the Command of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe;</hi> who by the Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Cardinals of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Barberini,</hi> from a Proteſtant was become a Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and had obtained the great Croſs of <hi>Malta;</hi> and with ſeveral Gallies and Ships, performed ſome Exploits at <hi>Biſerta,</hi> and at the <hi>Golletta</hi> near <hi>Tunis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Year 1641 being now entered, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan paſſed a moſt Luxurious Life in his Seraglio, conſuming an immenſe Treaſure on his Women; and whilſt wheſe two Fleets were preparing to proceed on their reſpective Expedition, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for <hi>Aſac</hi> had almoſt been diverted by the Rumors and Diſturbances on the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary;</hi> but they were ſoon afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, by an appearance of an Envoy from the Emperor, and return of a Chiaus to <hi>Vienna,</hi> with Ratification of all the former Articles and Conditions of Peace. Howſoever the German Internuncio was braved at the Port, for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſooner with his Preſents and Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Congratulation, for the happy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to the Ottoman Throne; ſo apt are the Turks to believe Acts of Civility, or Ceremony, to be Parts of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Submiſſion; and what Chriſtians have once given them voluntarily, is afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted as a Matter of Debt or Duty.</p>
                  <p>And being thus freed from a Suſpicion of Troubles in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and exempted from the Fears of waging two Wars at once, (which the Turks always ſtudiouſly avoid) they diſpatched a Letter into <hi>Poland,</hi> to demand paſſage for their Army, through that Country, to the Siege of <hi>Aſac;</hi> but that not being conſented unto; the Turks prepared to open their way by Force, and the Poles to defend the Paſſage. In which interim, many Diſaſters concurred, ſufficient to diſcourage the Turks in their Deſign; who are a People, that ſuperſtitiouſly calculate the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their Enterpriſes, by the difficulty or ſmooth ſucceſs of their firſt beginnings: For when the Vizier was ready to depart, a dreadful Fire happened in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, applying not only his Orders, but his own Perſon; he adventured ſo far, that he burned both his Hands, and ſinged his Beard in that manner, that he was forced to take his Bed for ſeveral Days, where he was honoured with a Viſit of the Sultan.</p>
                  <p>News alſo came at the ſame time, that <hi>Tauris,</hi> or <hi>Ecbatan,</hi> on the Borders of <hi>Perſia,</hi> was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ruin'd by an Earthquake; and what was worſe, the Sultan himſelf was ſeized with an Apoplexy, which turned to a Paralytical Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the Cauſe whereof was attributed to his exceſſive uſe of Women; to whom he was ſo immoderately addicted, that he conſumed his Days and Nights in their Apartments. This Diſeaſe, which is rarely or never cured, being joined to a Report given out by his Ladies, that notwithſtanding his Venereal Heat, he was yet Impotent as to Women; created a Belief, or at leaſt a ſtrong probability, that he might die without Iſſue, which cauſed high Confuſion in the Counſels of the Grandees, that no Deſign could make any chearful Progreſs, until Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was firſt made for Supply of the Ottoman Houſe; for the Succeſſion of the Tartar was in no manner convenient or ſecure; but rather that the Throne ſhould be furniſhed with the Son of a Siſter, or of a Niece, than to ſubject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Rule and Paſſions of a Foreign Prince. And though the Sultan did afterwards recover his Health, yet all ſuſpected and feared, that by the immoderate Heat of his Veneri I In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, he would die without Children; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one diſcourſing, as moved by his Paſſion, or his Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>About this time arrived an Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from the Softá of <hi>Perſia,</hi> bringing a Ratiſication of the Peace; who was ſo much the more welcome, by how much more the preſent
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:39539:29"/>Conjuncture rendred it advantagious; and being uſhered in with exceeding rich Preſents, raviſhed the Hearts of the Turks, whoſe good Nature melts and diſſolves with the ſight or hopes of Gifts.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> near the Conſines of <hi>Zara,</hi> the Turks made Incurſions on the Venetian Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and cauſed ſome Diſturbances: but being chaſtiſed by an Ambuſh laid for them, whereby about two hundred of them periſhed; all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were again reconciled, and the Peace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                  <p>And now one would imagine, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt <hi>Aſac,</hi> by ſuch diverſity of Obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were abſolutely laid aſide; which though they were of that Importance, and eſpecially the fear of <hi>Ibrahim</hi>'s Death, to detain the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier at Home; yet he thought fit to proſecute the Deſign under the command of the Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> to whom he had committed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this War.</p>
                  <p>The Paſha proud of his Charge,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Aſac.</hi>
                     </note> rejoiced to be imployed in a War, wherein he apprehended ſo little difficulty, and prognoſticated to himſelf nothing but Glory and Victory; eſteemed the Defendants for no other than Fiſhermen, and better experienccd to ſail their Boats, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their Saiks in the Black Seas, than to draw up an Army in the Field, or defend their Walls. This Confidence was farther increaſed, by an Embaſſy at the ſame time from the Moſcovite, who not only renounced all Aſſiſtance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for that Town, but renewed with them his Friendſhip, and Articles of ancient Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The Ottoman Army, beſides Janiſaries, and other Turks, conſiſted of Moldavians, and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachians, and a great number of Tartars, which at firſt entred into their Trenches, and beſieged the Town; but here they reſted not ſecurely, by reaſon of the frequent Sallies the Beſieged made upon them; and more eſpecially by the Mines which they ſprang, to the terror and damage of their Enemies. The Turks moved hereat, made furious Aſſaults, but were as valiantly repulſed by the Defendants, who threw ſcalding Water, and Pitch, and burning Sulphur upon the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; ſo that not being able to take the Town by Force, they retired to their Trenches, and deliberated in what manner, by fair Promiſes, and Mony; they might invite them to Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Hereupon the Captain-Paſha, the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> and others, tried the Efficacy of large Proffers of Priviledges to the Town, their Country, and Inhabitants; with a Gratuity of twelve thouſand Hungers of Gold: But theſe Promiſes could make no more entrance into their Hearts, than the Turks could do into their Walls, which they ſeemed reſolute to defend, wanting neither Proviſion, nor Ammunition, nor courage for the War: but on the contrary ſide, all theſe were wanting in the Turkiſh Camp; ſo that fifteen days paſſed without any Action, until they were ſupplied by the arrival of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brigantines, and light Veſſels, diſpatched with all expedition with the neceſſaries of War: At the coming of which, the Turkds prepared for another Aſſault, which they continued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly for the ſpace of ſeven days, but were received with that vigour by the Beſieged, that they could not gain one palm or inch of ground; So that at length with diſgrace, and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were forced to give over their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, deſpairing to gain the Town in the time, and with the Force which was allotted for this Enterprize.</p>
                  <p>With this ill Succeſs, Extremity and Famine pinched the Turks in their Trenches ſo much, that an Ox was ſold for fifteen Zechins, a Lamb for three, and a Meaſure of Barley, which fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Horſe for one time, for a Dollar; ſo that at length they were forced to raiſe the Siege; and the Captain Paſha, by tempeſtuous Weather, was conſtrained to ſhelter his Fleet in the Port of <hi>Caffa.</hi> In their return Home, the General was fearful of having forfeited his Head; the Commanders were ſilent, and aſhamed of their Succeſs, and the Souldlers diſcouraged, famiſhed, and poor; for they had loſt three thouſand Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees, ſeven thouſand Janiſaries, and eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred other Souldiers, beſides Moldavians, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachians, and Tartars; thoſe that ſurvived of the Foot were naked, and many ſick; the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees were without Horſes, with which they were ſupplied by the Tartars; and in fine, ſo unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful were all Matters, that the Veteran Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery avouched, that they never endured a more cruel, nor a more miſerable War.</p>
                  <p>And now we ſhall end this Year 1641,<note place="margin">The juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of a Perſian Traytor.</note> with the ruin of <hi>Emir Guimir,</hi> a Perſian by Birth, a Favourite, and yet Traitor to his Natural Prince. This <hi>Emir,</hi> in the laſt Wars which Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tay <hi>Morat</hi> waged againſt <hi>Perſia,</hi> was entruſted with an Embaſſy, and with Couduct of part of his Army, but he betrayed both to the Turk, under whoſe Protection he took Sanctuary, and obtained great Gifts and Preferments, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Price of his Treachery. Sultan <hi>Morat</hi> afterwards beſtowed a magnificent Seraglio upon him, ſituated on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> enriched him with a vaſt Treaſury, and what is more, with his Favour, making him his Companion in his Paſtimes, and his Confident in his ſerious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: It was he that firſt perſwaded the Sultan to drink Wine, in which both of them were beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intemperate, and mighty and valiant to bear, until the heat thereof having extinguiſhed the natural heat of their Stomachs, it became too cold and crude, unleſs corrected, or fortified with Rach, or diſtilled Spirits. The Fumes of ſuch ſtrong Drinks, were the cauſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Actions which <hi>Morat</hi> practiſed in his Life, and afterwards became the means to haſten his Death; whoſe days being ended, it was time alſo for proſperous Wickedneſs to expire, and to meet a Puniſhment equal to its Demerits, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one day, (having deſired Licenſe of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier to return to his own Country, where it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he had by Mony purchaſed his Pardon) he was called to the Vizier's Preſence, and there, without any Impeachment, Proceſs, or Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had the String applied to his Throat, and ſtrangled on the place; the reaſon hereof ſome give, to be the immenſe Riches which Sultan <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> had beſtowed upon him, though there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not many Cauſes to render him ſuſpected, and obnoxious to the preſent Government; firſt, becauſe he was too well acquainted with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Seraglio, and of that State, to live in any other country than the Turkiſh Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; then it was feared that the Perſian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador might make uſe of this Perſon to act what Treaſon he pleaſed on the remainder of the Ottoman Family, on promiſe that ſuch an Attempt ſhould expiate his former Villany, and regain the favour of his natural Prince. But ſuch ſignal Actions as theſe, are commonly wrote in ſuch large Characters of Divine Juſtice, which never leſt treaſon unpuniſhed, either in this life or the other; that we need not ſearch or enquire for a further Cauſe or Occaſion of this Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:39539:29"/>
                  <p>The Year 1642 being now entred, and the Turks deſirous to repair their laſt Years Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, reſolved again, with better Preparation and Conduct, to attempt <hi>Aſac;</hi> but before they would engage, according to their uſual Cuſtom, they determined to conclude all Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brages, and Matters of Diſpute ariſen on the Conſines of <hi>Hungary.</hi> To which end, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror deputed the Baron of <hi>Qneſtemberg,</hi> with other Barons; and the Turks on their ſide com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated the Paſhaws of the Confines, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions not to inſiſt too ſtrictly on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, loſt it ſhould retard the Peace, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the other Deſign of War: Wherefore the Turks condeſcenging to Matters reaſonable; and yielding up part of their Uſurpation, a Peace was concluded for twenty Years, much to the Advantage and Favour of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And now,<note place="margin">The Birth of Sultan <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
                     </note> to give farther Courage to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of higher Attempts, the whole Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire was repleniſhed with Joy, for the Birth of a young Prince Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> that now reigns; ſo that the ſuppoſed Impotency of the Father (whereby the Ottoman Family might have been extinguiſhed) was proved otherwiſe by plain Effect; and the fear of thoſe that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Empite vaiſhing by the Riſing of this new Star, all places were filled with Joy and Triumphs; only the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> finding himſelf thus diſappointed, was <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> not willing to concur heartily in this common Joy. In this manner vaiſhed the appearance of Civil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention in that Family, which now flouriſhes and encreaſes every day, and inſenſibly creeps for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the Deſign (which they hope) of an Univerſal Monarchy. Pardon me, O Chriſtian Kings, if I ſay inſenſibly, for methinks you are ſenſible of the leaſt touch you receive from one another, but feel not the gripes and pinches of your Common Enemy, who like a Hectick Feaver hath mingled with your Blood, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the Marrow of your Strength, where he will lurk until he hath diſſolved the Fabrick of your Chriſtian World, unleſs expelled by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord amongſt your ſelves, and the Divine Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Stance favouring your united Forces.</p>
                  <p>But now to return again to the famous Siege of <hi>Aſac;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The War renewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſac.</hi>
                     </note> It being the cuſtome to caſt all Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in War on the General, the Viſier diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed the Captain-Paſha, taking upon himſelf that Office and Title, of which there was never any former Example. In the Place likewiſe of the Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> was conſtituted <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Paſha of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> which Government, though much inferiour to his former, yet was received without fence of Diſgrace, it not being the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Power of any office that confers Honour, but the Favour and good Will of the <hi>Sulan.</hi> Nor did only the Miſcarriage of the late War tend to the diſrepute of the former Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> but the Report of his having poiſoned the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar <hi>Han</hi> encreaſed the difficulty of reconcilement with his Superiors, which being a Matter rather ſuſpected than proved, excuſed him from far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſhment than only a deprivation of his Office.</p>
                  <p>The new Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria</hi> thus taking upon himſelf the Command of the Army, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this War, aſſembled a Force of <hi>Turks, Tartars, Moldavians,</hi> and <hi>Walachians,</hi> far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the number of the laſt Year. At the News of which, and of the Fleet of Gallies deſigned to beſiege them by Sea, they apprehended their Danger ſo great, that without the Aſſiſtance of the Moſcovite, they concluded it impoſſible to defend their City; to him therefore they made Applications for Succour, repreſenting unto him the extremity their Affairs were in, by reaſon of that powerful Enemy which threatned them; and that having always acknowledged him for their Protector, there was no Refuge left them but under the defence of his Arms. But hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Moſcovite gave a brief reply, That he had lately concluded Peace with the Turk; ſince which, having received from him no occaſion of breach, he could not with any Juſtice engage ſo ſoon againſt him in a War.</p>
                  <p>The Coſſacks being thus diſappointed of their principal Hopes,<note place="margin">The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <hi>Aſac.</hi>
                     </note> reſolved to abandon their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but to make the beſt advantage of their flight, they carried with them all their Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables; and demoliſhed their ſalls, and ruined their Houſes, leaving the Place a notorious Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of Deſpair and Ruin; and no other Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion to their Enemies, than the compaſs of ſo much ground peſtered with Rubbiſh, and rude heaps of Stones. The Paſha howſoever abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly contented, that his very Name was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to affright his Enemies, entred the City with Triumph, where he began to repair the Walls, and invite the Inhabitants to return, with all aſſurance of Security, and Protection. This gentle Treatment recalled many back to their Homes, ſo hardly are Men weaned from their Native Country; and in a ſhort time the City beginning to fill, all Matters ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their priſtine State and Condition.</p>
                  <p>About this time the Perſian,<note place="margin">The Perſian renews his League.</note> by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, renewed his League with the Turk, and confirmed it in the Name of the new king; which was performed on condition that the <hi>Soft</hi> ſhould demoliſh the Fortreſs of <hi>Fortrina,</hi> which he had, contrary to Articles, built on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, not far from the Caſpian Sea; which that it might aſſuredly be performed, a Capugibathee was diſpatched to ſee it effected.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner, <hi>Aſac</hi> being ſubdued, and a Peace ſecured with the Perſian; The Turks, who can neither live in quiet with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, nor obſerve Capitulations longer than they turn to their advantage, contrived to take <hi>Giavarine,</hi> aliàs <hi>Rab,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs on the Confines of <hi>Hungary,</hi> by a Stratagem which they deſigned in this manner: Certain souldiers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited like Peaſants,<note place="margin">The Turks ſeek to take <hi>Rah</hi> by Stratagem.</note> were crouded into ſeveral Carts, covered with Hay, which being entered within the Walls, were immediatly to leap forth, and ſurpriſe the Centinels and Guards at the Gates (which might eaſily be executed on Men, whom twenty Years before of Peace had made ſecure) theſe were to be ſeconded by four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Souldiers, which lay ready in a Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Vally; but it happened, That an Officer of the Garriſon returning from Hunting, had by chance diſcovered this ſtrong Party of Turks, which cauſed him to quicken his pace towards the Town, and overtaking in his way certain Carts of Straw, which appearing to be laden in a form different to what was uſual, increaſed in him a farther ſuſpicion of Treachery; how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he proceeded forward with the more haſte, yet without any appearance of Jealouſy: until being entred into the Town, he declared what he had ſeen, at which the Gariſon was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in Arms; and having permitted the Carts to enter, the Bridg was drawn up, and the Carts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſearched, the shole Fraud and Treachery was diſcovered; and having made the Turks Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and armed the Walls with Souldiers, the whole Deſign was diſappointed; ſo that thoſe who lay in Ambuſh returned to their own Cities, The Emperor hereupon reſolved to ſend
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:39539:30"/>an Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> complain of this Treachery; whereof the Turks being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and the more becauſe it did not ſucceed; reſufed to admit the Ambaſſador, unleſs the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror would firſt agree to pay a yearly Charge of an hundred thouſand Ris-Dollars to the Port; not by way of Tribute, but of preſent; in which unreaſonable Demand, they took more confidence, in regard they perceived that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Swede.</hi> Upon this diſhonourable Demand, the Emperor deferr'd the Embaſſy intended, ſuppoſing it leſs perilous to adventure a War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> than diſhonourable to condeſcend unto a Propoſition ſo derogatory to the Majeſty of his Ceſarean Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>This Year 1643 being entered, the Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> conveyed his Annual Tribute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten thouſand Zechins, to the Port; which when the Agents of that Prince preſented before the Vizier, he ſeemingly refuſed it; pretending that the compleat Tribute was to be fifteen thouſand, according to Agreement: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents replied, that five thouſand had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> not by way of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity or Recompence for his Service, but in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, or as the price of two Cities, which the Prince had yielded to the Sultan, out of his own proper Eſtate in <hi>Hungary:</hi> With which Anſwer the Vizier remained ſatisfied, being jealous of the Turbulent and active Spirit of that Prince.</p>
                  <p>During all theſe Wars and Revolutions in Kingdoms and States, Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> contained and contented himſelf within the Precincts of his Seraglio; where becoming a faithful and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Soldier of <hi>Venus,</hi> he conſumed more Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in that War, than his Brother <hi>Morat</hi> did in Foreign Conqueſts; and being, as it were, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the Mahometan Paradiſe, where the Company of fair Women is the chiefeſt Felicity promiſed, he laboured to increaſe the Ottoman Family, and to acquit his People of the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion they had of wanting an Heir to ſucceed in the Throne; ſo that on the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> he had a ſecond Son born, and a third on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following; which abſolutely took away the Reproach of his Frigidity or Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, proving afterwards the moſt laſcivious and devout Sultan that ever aſpired to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Heaven.</p>
                  <p>This Year the Turks armed out twenty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies more than uſual, beſides thirty Sail of Ships, and Gally-Groſſes; in the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> riding at the Seraglio Point (where the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in Chief came to take their leave of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi>) they divided into two Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons; one of which conſiſting of twenty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, under the Command of <hi>Beker</hi> Paſha, took their Voyage into the Black Sea; the remainder under the Captain Paſha, ſailed for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with intention to do Juſtice on the Paſha of that Iſland, whoſe Riches gained by Oppreſſion, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched him from due Obedience towards his Prince; and being arrived there, without Rumor or Noiſe, giving ſigns of good Will and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects towards the Paſha, one day he ſent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite him Aboard to banquet with him; where the Paſha fooliſhly coming, and having well eaten and drank with him, his Entertainment had not time time to digeſt, before he breathed his Laſt; for being on his departure, the Slaves aſſaulted him, and ſtrangled him by Order of the Captain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Paſha.</p>
                  <p>No other Matters remarkable did the Turkiſh Fleet perform this Year at Sea, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to their Winter-Quarters. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Year proved ſavourable to many poor Chriſtians in Slavery; for there happening a moſt miſerable Plague in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed the Spirits of Men, and rendered every one ſo negligent in his Office, that about four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand Slaves taking advantage of ſuch Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their Guardians, ſeized a Ship in Port, and crouding themſelves therein, ſet Sail, and landed ſome of their People at <hi>Candia,</hi> others at <hi>Malta,</hi> the reſt at <hi>Marſeillia,</hi> by which means they happily regained their Liberty: on which incouragement eight hundred more adventuring to perform the like, and fighting in a Body at the Gate of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> three hundred of them were flain, the reſt leaped into a Gally, which though without Oars, had yet her Sails to the Yard, and having the fortune of a favourable Wind, arrived ſafe at <hi>Candia;</hi> in like manner they became free, taking convenient paſſage from thence to divers parts of Chriſtendom: Theſe Slaves were all redemanded by the Grand Signior from the Venetians; in which no Satisfaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, was one Cauſe and Original of that War which afterwards enſued.</p>
                  <p>And now the Year 1644 being begun, <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotski,</hi> who was never contented but in Combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and never at. eaſe but when he was proving new Projects, made Demands of certain Places on the Confines of <hi>Moravia,</hi> ſcituated within the Mountains, which he challenged as the Inheritance of his Son; beſides other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences which he made in right of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi> To forward which Deſigns, moved with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Enmity to the Auſtrian Family, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to win the Hearts of the Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with a plauſible Declaration for Liberty, and to throw off the Yoke which had ſo long gauled the Neck of <hi>Hungary;</hi> whereby having raiſed an Army of twenty thouſand Horſe, and thirty thouſand Foot, he entred, and ſpoiled the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of his old Enemy and Neighbour the Count of <hi>Humanay</hi> an Hungarian, took <hi>Solnock</hi> by force, and beſieged <hi>Fileck,</hi> and <hi>Caſſovia:</hi> For ſuppreſſion of which Inſurrection and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> the Emperor was forced to a War; and having Rendezvouſed his Army at <hi>Presbourg,</hi> the Conduct thereof was committed to the Charge of Cout <hi>Puceain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks having intelligence of theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for War, commanded twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men to march into thoſe Parts to oppoſe theſe Combuſtions on the Frontiers; with ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thouſand of which the Count <hi>Puecaim</hi> encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering furiouſly, aſſaulted and routed them. And in the mean time <hi>Ragotski</hi> laying aſide all care for the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> applied himſelf to relieve <hi>Olimz</hi> in <hi>Moravia;</hi> but in his March thither he was recalled by the Inhabitants of <hi>Sendar,</hi> which is a Caſtle erected on a Hill near <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſurrender unto him; but the Governor <hi>Forgatz,</hi> of the People, a Civil War began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, but at length the advantage falling unto <hi>Ragotski,</hi> the Gates were opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Tranſylvanians; with which Succeſs their Spirits being raiſed to higher Matters, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward, until General <hi>Getz</hi> with a ſtrong Body, gave a ſtop unto their Progreſs. And thus was the Fire of ſar rekindled again in <hi>Hungary,</hi> by means of <hi>Ragotski;</hi> to whom notwithſtanding the Turks would never adhere, being well acquainted with his turbulent and unſteady Humour. In the mean time the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror diſpatched his Ambaſſador with rich Presents to the Sultan, deſiring him to forbear giving far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſiſtance unto <hi>Ragotski;</hi> but what between
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:39539:30"/>Skirmiſhes, Propoſitions, and Treaties, Matters were not complſed until the <hi>14th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1645, at which time all Articles were concluded and ſigned between the Emperor and <hi>Ragotski.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to return now to the Affairs of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having the Fortune of Active and Prudent Miniſters, attended en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to his Paſtimes and Pleaſures, without Prejudice to his Intereſt, and the State of his Empire; for the firſt Vizier being Faithful and Vigilant, immediately cut off thoſe Members with the Sword, which he ſuſpected in the leaſt manner inclinable to Sedition; amongſt which were the Paſhaws of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Caffa.</hi> For by this kind of ſeaſonable and ſpeedy Remedies, the Plethory of the Ottoman Empire is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evacuated, and the Body Politick thereof reſtored to its priſtine ſtate of Health and Safety.</p>
                  <p>In like manner the <hi>Valede Sultana,</hi> being a Woman of great Courage and Abilities, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed carefully to the Welfare of her Son, whom ſhe ſometimes decked up, and ſet forth as a Property of Majeſtick Gravity to the People, whilſt ſhe her ſelf aſſumed the Authority, and carried allthings with a high and imperious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and being ambitious to be feared as well as honoured, ſhe laid Viloent Hands on the firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, called <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> and ſtrangled him; for though he was an Active and Faithful Miniſter, yet becauſe he paſſed ſomething on her which ſhe imagined did favour of neglect, and becauſe ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended his Power, which was greatly confirmed by the Intereſt and Favour he had with the Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and their Favourers, ſhe reſolved to make him an Example, as well of her Revenge, as her Power; after whoſe Death the Charge of firſt Vizier was conferred on <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fame Fate befel the Captain-Paſha, who was likewiſe ſtrangled for having over-boldly, or peremptorily, made anſwer to ſome Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies of the Grand Signior; and his Office was afterwards conferred on <hi>Beker</hi> Paſha of <hi>Rhodes.</hi> With ſuch Rigour as this do the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans govern, who reſolve to be obeyed, and to have their Commands executed without delay or contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe Matters were in agitation,<note place="margin">The Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars make Incurſions into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace.</note> the Tartars forgetful of their Peace, made another Incurſion with thirty thouſand Men into <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Koniſpolski</hi> having made Head with twenty thouſand Men only, overthrew them, and killed twelve thouſand, and took three thouſand Priſoners, purſuing the reſt to the Borders of <hi>Walachia.</hi> In like manner <hi>Wiſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> a noble Polander, happily encountred ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party of Tartars, as they were on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from ſpoiling the Countries of <hi>Moſcovia;</hi> of whom having killed 10000 Men, he recovered their Booty, and ſent the reſt Home naked and empty. This was the true and moſt effectual Means for the Polanders to avenge and right their Injuries, and more prevalent then Ambaſſies and Meſſages of Complaint unto the Port; which we have experienced ſince, and in the preſent Reign of the Son of <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> to have been ſo far from producing Matter worthy ſo much as the Charge of the Ambaſſador, that they have been retorted with lgnominy and affronts.</p>
                  <p>But here <hi>Ibrahim</hi> perceiving how the Poles had avenged themſelves with their own Sword, would ſeem to approve of the Action, which he could not hinder; and to appear a ſincere Obſerver of the Peace, he depoſed the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> for his unlawful Incurſions; which was ſuch a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> as they never could obtain by force of Juſtice, Complaints, and Vertue of paſſive Valour, until their active Fortitude cook their Cauſe in Hand, and pleaded for them.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> of this Year, a fourth Son was born to Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and on the <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> following, being in the Year 1645, notwithſtanding all the Reports of his Impotency, was born a fifth Son, named <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman,</hi> to the great contentment of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>The Turks Gallies this Year, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Beker</hi> their new Captain-Paſha, made an Attempt on the Coaſt of <hi>Calabria,</hi> bringing from thence two hundred Slaves; and attempting the like near <hi>Corton,</hi> paid for their former Booty, with the loſs of five hundred Men.</p>
                  <p>How ſoever, the Gallies of <hi>Malta,</hi> being ſix in number, had better Succeſs as to themſelves, though the Conſequences thereof proved fatal to the Venetians, having given the firſt occaſion of that long War, which afterwards enſued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Turk and them.</p>
                  <p>The truth of which Story is this,<note place="margin">The Story of Kuzlir Aga, his Slave and Son taken by the Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſes.</note> free of all Romance or Fable, which the Knights of St. <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Malta</hi> would mix therewith: It happened that the Kuzlir Aga, or chief Eunuch, which governs the Women in the Signior's Seraglio, having caſt his Eye on a fair Slave, then ſet to ſale by a Perſian Merchant, became ſo enamoured of her, that he purchaſed her for himſelf, under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a virgin, at the price of four hundred and fifty Dollars: But the Eunuch had not long entertained this Lady in his Service, before ſhe proved with Child; not by him (you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) if you underſtand how the Eunuchs of this Country are diſarm'd of their Virility: At which he was ſo greatly offended, that he ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her from his Society, and confined her to the Houſe of his Steward. The time being come for her to be delivered of her great Belly, it proved a Son; and ſome Months after, the Aga being deſirous to ſee the Babe, was ſo pleaſed with the aſpect of it, that he reſolved to adopt it for his own, ordering it Cloaths, and other Neceſſaries agreeable to its Condition. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that about that time Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> (which now reigns) was then born; and there wanting a Nurſe for the Child, this beautiful Slave was preferred to the Honour; ſo that ſhe was entertained near two Years in the Seraglio: During which time Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> took ſuch an affection to the Nurſe's Boy, that he loved him better than his own eldeſt Son, who was of a bad Complexion, and of no better Air in his Face than his Father, and took great delight to play and ſport with him; at which the Mother of Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed, that ſhe could not longer endure either Nurſe or her Boy; and for her ſake, took ſo much diſpleaſure againſt the Kuzlir Aga, who preferred her, that neither his preſence nor Service were acceptable; and ſo violent ſhe was in her Paſſion, that one day, when Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was playing with his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children in the Garden, according to his uſual Cuſtom, throwing them one on the other into the Water, the Queen grew ſo furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that ſhe could not contain longer from venting her Anger in unhanſome Terms, and jealouſy againſt the Nurſe and her Son. At which the Sultan being much diſpleaſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill-natured, (if we may ſpeak boldly of an Emperor) took her Son (which is now Sultan <hi>Mahomet</hi>) out of her Arms, and with ſome few Curſes ſwung him into a Ciſtern; where he had been certainly drowned, had not every one in that inſtance applied themſelves to ſave him; at
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:39539:31"/>which time he received the Mark or Scar he wears at this day in his Forehead.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Matters ſerved for farther Fuel to nouriſh the implacable Spirit of the Queen; which the Kuzlir Aga well obſerving, judged it prudence to give way to her Fury, and ſo beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Diſmiſſion from the Court, together with his Slave and Son; and that having wiſited <hi>Mecha,</hi> according to his Law, he might enjoy a Retirement in <hi>Egypt,</hi> which is the Portion of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Eunuchs.</p>
                  <p>The Queen eaſily conſented hereunto; nor was it difficult to procure the Licence of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who was as eaſily perſwaded to any by thoſe who were about him; wherefore the Eunuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided, to be gone, ſhipped himſelf with his great Treaſure, on the Fleet which was now deſigned, and ready to depart for <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which conſiſted of three Ships; one a great Gallion, and two others of leſſer Burthen, and ſeven Saiks; theſe having at the beginning of their Voyage found contrary Winds,<note place="margin">The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh with the <hi>Malta</hi> Gallies.</note> put into <hi>Rhodes;</hi> from whence looſing with more favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Weather, they unfortunately met with ſix <hi>Malta</hi> Gallies, excellently well manned, and provided. The Admiral Gally immediately Boarded one of the Saiks, and took her, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned only by Greeks; by whom they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the Condition, Quality, and Cargo of the greater Ship, which gave Heat and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to the Souldiery. In like manner, with little Oppſition, the Gallies called the St. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of one of the leſſer Ships, which being laden only with Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, brought from the Black Sea, to build Ships at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> was of little value, having forty Turks aboard, eight Women, and a Child which ſucked at the Mother's Breaſt. In the mean time, the three other Gallies, called the St. <hi>Mary,</hi> St. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> attacked the great Gallion, and having caſt their Iron Graples into the Ship, with the Motion of the Ship, the Irons gave way and broke, only that of the St. <hi>Lorenzo</hi> held faſt, ſo that the whole force of the Ship, both of ſmall and great Shot, was poured in upon the Gally, to their damage and loſs of Men. In the mean time the Admiral Gally came in to their Aſſiſtance, and Aſſaulting the Ship on the other Quarter, made a Diverſion of their Men; and having thrown in their Graples, they ſcaled the ſides of the Gallion, as if it had been a Fortreſs; where being entred, they remained for ſome time at handy-blows with the Turks; but at length, all the Gallies coming to their help, having made an end of ſubduing the other Ships, the Turks were forced to retire under Covert of their Decks, which they defended ſtill with ſingular Valour, wounding the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans with their half Pikes through the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</p>
                  <p>But, in fine, the Captains of the Gallies, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that this was not the way to compel them to a ſpeedy Surrender, ordered ſeveral Muſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers out of every Gally, to ſire in at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and loop-holes of the Ship; by which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving killed their Commander in Chief, their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conſtancy began to fail, and deſirous to ſave their lives with loſs of Liberty and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, they caſt down their Arms, and begged Mercy.</p>
                  <p>In this Engagement were killed the Captain of the St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſeven Cavaliers, of which five were French, one Italian, and one German; the Admiral himſelf, and the Captain of his Gally were both wounded; ſeventy nine Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Mariners killed, and an hundred thirty two wounded: Of the Turks it is not certain how many fell, in regard as they were killed, according to Cuſtom, they caſt them over-board; the Eunuch himſelf, though always educated in the ſoftneſs of the Seraglio, and in the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Female Court, yet in the end con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his days like one of the Maſculine Sex, fighting valiantly with his Sword, until over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed by his Enemies: by which it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that thoſe Perſons loſe not their Courage with their virile Parts; for it hath been known in former days, how that Eunuchs have been Generals in the Turkiſh and other Armies, and conducted their Affairs with admirable Courage and Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>The Prize which the Chriſtians had gained in this manner, was very conſiderable; for beſides the Gold, Silver, and Jawels, which were the Treaſure this Eunuch had amaſſed in the Reign of three ſeveral Sultans, they gained three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Slaves, beſides thirty Women, ſome of which were young and Virgins; ſo that there was not a Souldier or Seaman who had not a conſiderable ſhare of benefit proportioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. With this Fortune, towing their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, they in a ſhort time came to an Anchor in the Port of <hi>Caliſmene,</hi> in the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> called anciently <hi>Phenice,</hi> on the South-ſide of the Iſland, remote from all Venetian Gariſons; and where (as it is reported) they were ſupplied with no Proviſions, excepting a ſmall quantity of Bisket, which was furniſhed by a Coutry Fellow, who for that very Cauſe was ſhot to Death. From hence the Gallies departing, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in <hi>Malta</hi> with their Prizes, where they were received in great Triumph. The young Son of the Eunuch (for ſo we call him) was reported to be a Son of the Grand Signior, fent into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be Educated, and was accordingly ſaluted, treated, and reverenced by the Grand Maſter; the ſame Opinion was diſperſed and confirmed in all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for many Years maintained at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the<note n="*" place="margin">Of the Knights of <hi>Malta.</hi>
                     </note> Religion, until the Boy grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to a good Age, and not judged worthy of a Ranſom, or enquiry after by the Turks, it was thought convenient for him to put off his State, and Greatneſs, and become a Fryer, and I think a Dominican, and this is he who now goes under the name of the <hi>Padre Ottomano.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The News hereof arriving at the Ottoman Court, Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was tranſported with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, threatning Deſtruction and Ruin unto <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> beſides he ſhewed a moſt inveterate Paſſion againſt the Venetians, for not guarding the Seas from his Enemies, and for relieving them in their Ports. In which Rage and Fury, he put his own Captain Paſha to death, and Summoned the Chriſtian Ambaſſadors, braving them all for the little reſpect was ſhown to his proper Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in ſhort, was angry with all, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Effect of his Wrath to be poured on the Venetians, to which this Accident admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the firſt Original, and will afford us am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple matter of Diſcourſe in this enſuing Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>For the Grand Signior firſt made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt <hi>Venice,</hi> to their Miniſter, or Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, then reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> called <hi>Soranço;</hi> alledging, that contrary to the Articles of Peace, they had afforded Prviſions and Entertainment to his Enemies in <hi>Candia,</hi> and at a time when having made Prize of his own Ship, and Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiques of his Seraglio, they ſeemed, with more extraordinary demonſtrations of Hoſpitality than uſual, to receive them into their Harbours.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39539:31"/>To which the Bailo made Anſwer, That his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty was ill informed of the true ſtate of thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; for that the Port to which the Malteſes came, had neither Caſtle nor Fortreſs belonging to it, but was an open, wide, and unfortified place; for if the Grand Signior is not able to defend thoſe Ships from careening, as they have often done before <hi>Rhodes</hi> it ſelf, how was it poſſible for the Venetians to drive them from the Seas, and deny them the uſe of that Salt Water, which hath neither Fort nor Caſtle to reach and command them? With which Anſwer <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſeemed to remain ſatisfied; and Matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo appeaſed on the ſide of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that <hi>Soranço,</hi> though a Perſon of a moſt acute and penetrating Judgment, imagined no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than a War: and though he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured otherwiſe, by ſomething that the Engliſh Ambaſſador had diſcovered in that Matter; yet becauſe it came not firſt from the Report of one of his own Interpreters, he would not ſeem to believe or give credit thereunto, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſtrong Probabilities that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Chriſtian Miniſters muſt neceſſarily, with much Difficulties, and leſs Inſpection, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern and penetrate Affairs in the Turkiſh Court than in any other; becauſe acceſs to the great Miniſters is ſeldom privately or familiarly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, from whence wiſe Men moſt commonly take their Meaſures and Obſervations; but on the contrary, are forced to act all by the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, of their Druggermen or Interpreters; and as they hear with their Ears, ſo are they often-times beholden to their Reflections; which how ſubject they may be to Error, is beſt known to thoſe Miniſters who have practiſed much and long in that Court.</p>
                  <p>And in this manner <hi>Ibrahim</hi> covered his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt <hi>Candia,</hi> by pretence of making War upon <hi>Malta,</hi> to which he had lately recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo juſt a provocation.</p>
                  <p>To this Enterprize, none inſtigated him more than a certain Hagia, or Tutor, which had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him in the time of his Solitude, and had inſtructed him in the firſt Principles of the Mahometan Doctrine; he was a ſubtil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Man, and one who kept a ſecret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence in the Chriſtian Courts; for being Maſter of what Gold he pleaſed, he paid for his Intelligence with Liberality and Secreſy; and though he was no Prophet, yet he pretended to be a Magician, or Conjurer, or one that had a Command or Soveraignty over Familiar Spirits; an Excellency greatly admired and reverenced by the Turks. This Man had for a long Seaſon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an opportunity to promote a War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Venice;</hi> eſteeming their Territories very convenient to be laid to the Turkiſh Dominions, and their Force an under-Match for the Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the Ottoman Empire. And now this Accident provoking the Deſire of the Turks to this War, and the Opportunity appearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to cover the Deſign, under pretence of Aſſailing <hi>Malta,</hi> it was ſecretly reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Iſland of <hi>Candia;</hi> for as its Strength and Situation made it the Key to all the other Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> ſo it would be the Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark of the Maritime Countries, from whence the Paſſage would be ſhort and eaſy into <hi>Africa;</hi> from whence the Gallies might advantagiouſly relieve <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and guard the Fleet from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and from thence might be opened a Door to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the other parts of <hi>Italy.</hi> On theſe Conſiderations, War being reſolved againſt <hi>Candia,</hi> Reports divulged the Deſign only againſt <hi>Malta,</hi> and for that end, Orders were iſſued for building and fitting an hundred Gallies, and as many Ships of War; and Commands ſent into <hi>Barbary</hi> for aſſiſtance of all their Naval Force, and the Day appointed for Rendezvous and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; all which time the Enterprize was kept ſecret, and by no more Symptoms ſuſpected, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by the unuſual Careſſes the Turks at that time over-acted in their officious kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Venetian Bailo.</p>
                  <p>The Report of theſe great Preparations fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over all Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> was entertained at <hi>Malta,</hi> with ſome Apprehenſions, as being the Place on which all the Storm was to refund its Fury.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon the Cavaliers or Knights of that Place, ſummoning a Council, reſolved to cite all the Fraternity to repair to the Defence of their Capital Seat, and of their Order and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony. Likewiſe Letters were directed to the ſeveral Officers, to prepare and ſend Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Match, and Lead, Iron Buckets, and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to make Carriages for Cannon, and for other Uſes; as alſo Corn, Bisket, Salt, Fleſh and Fiſh, Vinegar, Wine, and all other ſorts of Ammunition. They likewiſe inſtituted ſome Officers over the Waters, to ſee that the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Conduits ſhould be made clear which were to ſerve the City; and that thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, that were to remain in the poſſeſſion of the Enemy, ſhould be carefully and artificially poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; all the Mills remaining in the Fields were tranſported into the Town; the Doors and Windows of Wood belonging to the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants Houſes, were taken down and carried into the City, with all their Utenſils, and what elſe was portable, ſo that nothing remained but the wide Fields, and an open Air to breath in.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Venetians being a wiſe and jealous State, ſuſpected the werſt of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, and feared what their Miniſter at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> could not diſcover; which cauſed them to make ſome Preparations, but yet with that dexterity and ſecreſy, as not to render them diffident of the Turks Proceedings. For to be jealous of a Friend, is ſometimes to make him an Enemy; and Diſtruſt always argues Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which Prudence teaches to conceal from thoſe who are more powerful than our ſelves. Some were notwithſtanding of Opinion, that the Complaints of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> were only Artifices to extract the Blood of Gold, which they judged fit to adminiſter, if it were poſſible to, ſatisfy the Appetite of thoſe Leeches. Others were of a contrary ſenſe, and would by no means admit it for good Couſel, or Policy, to buy their Peace of the Turk; for, beſides that it was diſagreeable to the Grandeur of <hi>Venice,</hi> it was but a Shadow that they purchaſed, ſince their Enemies could on every ſlight Occaſion reaſſume what they had ſold, and make the Menaces of War, and the Sale of Peace, ſerve them for a perpetual Fountain, an Mine of Gold and Treaſure; and that ſince it was neceſſary, at one time or other, to caſt off this Yoke of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; the ſooner it was done, the Advantage would be the greater, and the Honour more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the World, ſeeming to make War ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Choice, than their laſt Remedy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Orders were given to the Bailo, with all Prudence and Art, to touch gently the Pulſe of the Turks, to diſcover if Mony would redeem the preſent Quiet of their State.</p>
                  <p>But the Reſentment that the Turks had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, was grown apparent in the comportment towards the Bailo; for having one day demanded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:39539:32"/>Audience, he attended ſeveral hours without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; yet when the Ambaſſador of <hi>Ragotski</hi> come to the Vizier, he no ſooner entred the Houſe than he was received: and at the ſame time it was told the Bailo, that he might retire, for that there was no Place nor Seaſon at preſent to afford him Audience. In the mean time <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> himſelf walked often to the Arſenal, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and haſten his Preparations, laying an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo on all Strangers Veſſels in all Ports of the Ottoman Dominions. Orders were likewiſe diſpatched to <hi>Thebes, Negropont,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> for making Bisket; and to the <hi>Morea</hi> for cutting and ſquaring of Timbers, and ſacking Wools to fill up Trenches; in all which Rumor and Stir, there are was no other diſcourſe but of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of throwing that Iſland into the Sea with the Shovel and Mattock, and rendring it the moſt dreadful Example in the World of the Ottoman Rage and Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch Preludes as theſe, began a War of long continuance, maintained with various Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes for divers Years; the fatal Iſſue whereof, we our ſelves have ſeen and heard. But it is ſtrange to conſider, that an Exploit ſo Martial as this, ſhould commence in the Reign of a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan wholly given up to his Pleaſures, and ſo ſwallowed in Senſuality, that all thoſe luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and wanton Actions which are recounted of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> and <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> are flat and faint Similitudes of that prodigious Effeminacy, in which this Sultan outdid all other Examples of former Ages.</p>
                  <p>Amber was the common Perfumes which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perpetually in the Womens Apartments, and the common Sauce to moſt of his Viands; not perhaps becauſe it ſo much pleaſed his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, as that it was a provocative, and incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his Luſts.</p>
                  <p>And this puts me in mind of a Story I have heard of an Engliſh Merchant, living then at <hi>Galata,</hi> who was Maſter of a rare piece of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergrieſe, which was in form like a Pyramid; the News whereof was told to the Grand Signior late at Night, when the Smoke of the Perſumes began to abate: Which ſo ſoon as he heard, though it was near Midnight, he diſpatched a Meſſenger to call the Merchant with his Amber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieſe; who being knocked out of his Bed in haſte, by the importunity of the Officer, came to the Seraglio Gate two hours before Day; where he attended until it was broad Light, and then, without more words, found a Market for his Amber, and before his departure received 13 thouſand Dollars. The Female Court was then extreamly rich and ſplendid, all <hi>Italy</hi> was ſcarce able to ſupply it with Silks, and Cloth of Gold; ſo that the Trade was in thoſe days flouriſhing above other Times, and gave great employment to Engliſh Shipping: and ſo impatient were the Women for their Gay Cloaths, that ſo ſoon as the News of a Ship from <hi>Italy</hi> came, and that ſhe was arrived within the Caſtles of the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi> but there detained by contrary Winds, Gallies were immediately diſpatched to bring up their Silks, which they oftentimes forced away without any Account or Price made with the Merchant; of which that worthy Gentleman, Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh</hi> then Ambaſſador, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Vizier, and finding no other Relief than good Words, reſolved on an Expedient of making known his Cauſe to the Grand Signior, which was this.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Turkie</hi> they have a Cuſtom, that when any one receives a notable Injury, or Injuſtice, from the Chief and Great Miniſters of State, they put Fire on their Heads, and running to the Grand Signior, no Man can hinder or deny them acceſs to his preſence. In like manner the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ambaſſador not being able to obtain Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the Vizier, in return to his many Complaints, drew out all the Engliſh Ships in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata,</hi> which were then thirteen in number, and drawing in their Guns, and ſhutting the Ports, put fire on every Yard-Arm of their Ships, and came to an Anchor juſt before the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> The Cuſtomer being the firſt that eſpyed this unuſual ſight, immediately apprehended the Reaſon, and ſent to acquaint the Vizier thereof in all haſte; the Vizier likewiſe fearful leſt the Complaints ſhould by this means come to the Grand Signior's Ear, ſent the Cuſtomer aboard with a conſiderable part of the Mony, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that the Fires might be extinguiſhed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing faithfully to comply in paiment of the reſt; hereupon Conſultation being had between the Ambaſſador and the Merchants, the Ships returned to their Stations, not ſeeming to have been taken notice of by thoſe in the Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>And notwithſtanding the great number of Women within the Seraglio, all which were at the Devotion of the Sultan; yet <hi>Ibrahim</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented herewith, paſſing one day to <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari,</hi> had by chance caſt his eye on an object which much pleaſed him: what it was, becomes not the modeſty of my Pen to relate; but being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his Seraglio, he ſent Orders to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, to ſeek out for him the biggeſt, and beſt proportioned Woman which was to be found in all <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the parts thereabouts. Hereupon Emiſſaries were diſpatched into all Quarters of the City; at length they happily procured a huge tall Armenian Woman, well proportioned according to her height, and a Gianteſs for her Stature; which being found, ſhe was preſently waſhed and perfumed in the Bath, and as richly Cloathed and Adorned as the ſhortneſs of time would permit: There was no great difficulty to perſwade her to become Turk, having ſo high preferment in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. So that being introduced to the Grand Signior's preſence, he became immediately Ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured, and was ſo pleaſed with her Society, that he preferred her before all the Women of his Court; an Evidence whereof he gave, in that he could not deny her in any requeſt ſhe could make, and particularly about that time the Paſhaluck of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> being void, this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man begged it for her ſelf, ſubſtituting another in the Office, who was accountable to her for all the Profits and Emoluments thereof: By theſe particulars of favour the Queen-Mother becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing jealous, one day inviting her to Dinner, cauſed her to be ſtrangled, and perſwaded <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> that ſhe died ſuddenly of a violent Sickneſs, at which he poor Man was greatly afflicted.</p>
                  <p>But not to inſiſt long on theſe luxurious Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, we ſhall return again to Matters of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Concernment: <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had now underſtood, that the Venetians growing jealous of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, began likewiſe to Arm, and provide for the worſt; which being in no wiſe pleaſing to the Turks, who were apprehenſive that their Marine Forces conſiſted moſt in ſurprize, cauſed <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to complain of the Defenſive Poſture in which they Arrayed themſelves, alledging, that Suſpicions of this Nature argued no hearty Diſpoſition towards their Friends; nor was any thing more contrary to a good Correſpondence, or more diſobliging than ſuch like Jealouſies, which oft-times beget that Enmity which was never deſigned; and farther it was judged neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:39539:32"/>if poſſible, to diſſwade the Bailo from a belief of any Hoſtility deſigned againſt his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; to inculcate which, none was eſteemed ſo proper an Inſtrument as the old cheating <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> who was the firſt Motive to the War; a Preacher who imagined that the excellency of his Religion afforded him a priviledg to falſify, lye, and commit any Act for advantage thereof, though never ſo contrary to Truth and Morality. This <hi>Santone,</hi> with the Teſtimony of one or two more grand Profeſſors, with many Aſſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Vows, endeavoured to perſwade the Bailo, of the Grand Signior's good Intentions towards <hi>Venice,</hi> and his fixed Reſolutions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy <hi>Malta.</hi> And though the Concernment which thoſe godly Elders ſhewed, and the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs they uſed, whereby to inculcate a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to what they affirmed, were enough to diſcover their contrary Intentions; and though it is ſaid, that the Venetians could not heartily believe what they ſo ſtrongly ſuſpected; yet hereby, and by the common vogue of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they abated much of their Caution and Heat, which they otherwiſe had uſed in due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and Proviſions againſt an Evil ſo fatal and deſtructive in the ſequel.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Act of Hoſtility was committed by <hi>Giacomo da Riva,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the War.</note> who being ſent for Sopravedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to <hi>Tino,</hi> was in his way to touch at <hi>Candia,</hi> there to deliver Ammunition and Proviſions for War; but being encountered by ſome barbarous Veſſels, who aſſailed him for a Merchants Ship of ſmall Force, were received ſo warmly that he ſunk one of them, with which the reſt left him and fled, relating at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that they had been ill treated by the Venetians, and that they gave the firſt Aſſault upon them, becauſe they were called to the Aſſiſtance and Service of the Grand Signior.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet and Land Forces being already put to Sea, the Report and Opinion ſtill continued, that the War was deſigned againſt <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta;</hi> wherefore ſuch as apprehended the Hazard, and were acquainted with the Difficulty of ſuch an Enterprize, began to inform the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior how impoſſible it was that this Action ſhould be accompanied with good ſucceſs. To which Arguments he made no other reply, than by a ſeeing obſtinacy, reſolved with the Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman Sword, to cut all thoſe Knots and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which oppoſed him in the Work. At length one <hi>Salee Efendi,</hi> a Preacher, who had obtained ſome more than ordinary Eſteem with the Grand Signior, adviſed him, That before he commenced a Work of that importance, he ſhould inform himſelf of the true ſtate of that Place, from a certain Aga, who was lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Malta.</hi> The Grand Signior being very willing to hear any thing of this nature, called the Aga, who related to him how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable both the City and Caſtle were; how the Knights were provided againſt all Aſſaults; that the Iſland it ſelf is only a Rock, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Earth enough for an Army to intrench; that the Approaches muſt be made by the Pick-Axe and Mattock, it being all Stone. In ſhort, it was not a place to be taken in one Summer, and the Winter coming on, it affording no ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor proviſions of it ſelf, was not capable of relief in Seas ſo ſtormy, and from Countries ſo remote, without hazards, loſſes, and frequent Shipwracks. <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who had deſigned all along to make War upon <hi>Candia,</hi> ſeemed little concerned or moved at this Diſcourſe. The Gallies and Ships which were now all in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, being come forth to the Seraglio point, the Grand Signior entered his Grand Ciosk, ſituated on the Bank of the Sea; where the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictar Aga, General, and all the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, came to perform the uſual Ceremonies of Obedience and Duty before their Departure. At this ſolemn Aſſembly the Grand Signior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, That his Intentions were to make War upon the Infidels, according as every one ſhould underſtand by his reſpective Commiſſions, which ſhould now be delivered unto them: That he expected the higheſt Demonſtrations of Courage in them imaginable, and what was agreeable to the Conductors of the Ottoman Armies: That Reward and Puniſhment were in his Hands, and that he reſolved to diſpenſe them according to their Merits: That they ſhould not doubt of all due Aſſiſtance and Succours; for he had ſo well contrived, and ſo juſtly fitted all his Meaſures, that he was already provided of Men, Timber, Ammunition, and Mony ſufficient to maintain and carry on this War for ſeven Years. At which they all gave a ſhout, and declared, that they were ready to ſpend their Blood and Lives in Execution of his Commands. Whereupon every one received a rich Coftan, or Veſt, and the General a Scimitar ſet with Diamonds; who being a young Man of about 26, or 27 Years of Age, had a Council of ſix graver Paſha's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; and then the Commiſſion for the War was brought forth ſealed, with Orders not to open it, until they were paſt the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> Hereat the noiſe of great and ſmall Shot from the Gallies and Ships, reſounded through all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and the Commanders repairing to their Veſſels, the Aſſembly broke up, and every thing was put in a poſture to make Sail.</p>
                  <p>It was now the laſt day of <hi>April,</hi> 1645, old Style, when the Fleet firſt broke ground, which conſiſted of 73 Gallies, beſides the 8 Gallies of <hi>Barbary;</hi> 2 Mahons, or Galleaſſes, one great Gallion called the <hi>Sultana,</hi> 10 Ships of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> 2 of <hi>Tunis,</hi> and 10 of Engliſh and Dutch Ships, which coming to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for Trade, were there preſſed into the Service, with about 300 Saiks and Caramuſſals, which carried Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Proviſions, Ammunition, and Utenſils for War. Their Militia conſiſted of 7000 Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries, 14000 Spahees, and about 50000 Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariots, and other Souldiers, with about 3000 Pioniers; theſe all were to Rendezvous at <hi>Scio;</hi> where they arrived the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>May.</hi> But before their departure from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Bailo <hi>Soranço,</hi> or the Venetian Ambaſſador, thought fit, in Complement, and for diſcovery, to make a viſit to the Captain-Paſha, by whom he was received with frank Courteſy, and aſſurance of Friendſhip; ſo that though he ſuſpected the worſt, yet could he collect no certain aſſurances of Peace, or War; however he adviſed Signior <hi>Cornaro,</hi> then Governour of <hi>Candia,</hi> that though he could not certainly penerate into the bottom of the Turks Deſign, yet he apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Storm might fall on that Kindom, underſtanding that the Captain-Paſha was not well inclined towards the moſt Serene Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: wherefore, he ought to be watchful and circumſpect, yet with as little demonſtration of jealouſy as was poſſible, ſo that if the Turks ſhould there arrive, he ſhould afford them all conveniencies of Watering, Proviſions, and other Refreſhments.</p>
                  <p>The Fleet being departed from <hi>Scio,</hi> for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli di Romagnia,</hi> the Northern Wind ſo freſhned, and blew ſo hard, that the Gallies were ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and forced to put into divers Ports, and the Saiks and Caramuſſals to Anchor at <hi>Micono</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:39539:33"/>and <hi>Tino.</hi> At the latter of which, belonging to the Venetians, they had licence to Water, and and were refreſhed with ſuch proviſions as the Iſland afforded; and now after this flurry of Wind, the Fleet being again united, they were ſeen off at Sea from <hi>Cerigo,</hi> an Iſland of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians at the Mouth of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> and failing towards the Channel of <hi>Braccio de Maina;</hi> and the next day 9 Gallies, a Gallion, and a Brigantine, made towards the Iſle of <hi>Cerigo,</hi> and ſent a Letter a ſhore by a Boat to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor, from the Paſha of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> demanding their uſual preſent of Coffee and Sugar, which was given them, they aſſuring all Friendſhip, and real good Intentions towards the People, and Dominions of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the mean time a Satia laden with Arms and Ammunition from <hi>Venice,</hi> bound for <hi>Retimo,</hi> unhappily falling into the Turkiſh Fleet, was intercepted by them, and taken, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masked all the Deſign, and made the Turks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their true Colours, notwithſtanding all their religious Proteſtations, and outwardly fair Comportment, the uſual diſguiſe of the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan Sincerity.</p>
                  <p>Towards the end of <hi>May</hi> the Turkiſh Fleet was diſcovered from <hi>Carabuſo,</hi> a ſmall Fortreſs of the Venetians, ſome diſtance off at Sea, ſtanding to the Weſtward, which gave ſome jealouſie to them at <hi>Candia;</hi> and being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſome precedent Acts, as that of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the depth of Water about St. <hi>Theodoro</hi> with a Brigantine, (which is a ſmall Rock lying off of <hi>Canea</hi>) which pretended to come from <hi>Sancta Maura</hi> with Turky Merchants, afforded unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable grounds of aſſurance to thoſe in <hi>Candia,</hi> that the War was deſigned againſt them; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the Ottoman Fleet rendezvouſing again at <hi>Navarino,</hi> a place far diſtant from <hi>Candia,</hi> altered their Apprehenſions at <hi>Venice,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where of this War, deeming it now certain, that this Deſign had no other aim or mark but that of <hi>Malta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this opinion was no ſooner entertain'd, than it was confuted by open Acts of hoſtility; for the Captain-Paſha being arrived at Cape <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Sunio,</hi> immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched a Brigantine to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Proceedings and Intentions to paſs directly for <hi>Candia;</hi> whereupon it was thought ſeaſonable to publiſh the War againſt <hi>Venice,</hi> which was performed with committing the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>Soranço</hi> to Priſion, and giving Orders through all the <hi>Archipelago</hi> to deſtroy or enſlave all the Subjects of that Republick. And here the Turk practiſed his uſual beginnings of War with more than ordinary Caution; for though with other Princes, whoſe Territories border on him by Land, he uſually endeavours to ſtrike at the ſame time when he gives the Salutations of Peace; Yet here being to contend at Sea, where he is conſcious his Forces are inferiour to thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> he practiſed all thoſe feigned Artifices, confirmed with as many holy Vows and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, as their Religion hallows, and makes lawful, when they can bring advantage and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to the Mahometan Faith.</p>
                  <p>But though the Venetian Republick was ſo politick as outwardly to demonſtrate a Religious Confidence of their potent Neighbour, whom they were conſcious not to have provoked by any breach of Capitulations; yet were not ſo ſecure of his Faith, and ſo eaſie to believe his fair Diſſimulations, as not prudently to provide againſt the utmoſt Effects of his Power and Treachery. Wherefore, whilſt the Turk pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, they armed likewiſe ſecretly, made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Levies without noiſe, commiſionated thirty extraordinary Commanders of Gallies, took up ſeventeen Engliſh and Dutch ſhips into their Service, armed out two Galliaſſes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; and when the Turk had unmasked his Deſign, they then imparted their Condition to all the Chriſtian Princes, craving their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and Aſſiſtance to maintain the Common Bulwark of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againtſt the comme Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Galleaſſes were commanded by <hi>Giro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamo Moroſini;</hi> the Gallies, of which fifteen were made ready, and afterwards put to Sea, all commanded by Noblemen, were under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Antonio Capello. Franceſco Molino</hi> was made Proveditor General, a Perſon of untainted Juſtice and Honour, and extraordinary zealous and vigilant in the Publick Intereſt, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable Labours and Care of his Country, promoted him afterwards to be Doge of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> By his Order and Counſel, extraordinary Proveditors were ſent to <hi>Candia, Cerigo,</hi> and <hi>Tino,</hi> as Places moſt feared, and in danger; and Orders were diſpatched to <hi>Andrea Cornaro,</hi> then General and Inquiſitor in <hi>Candia,</hi> to arm out twenty Gallies from the Arſenal of <hi>Canea;</hi> and to promote this Deſign the better, he hired two Engliſh, and one Dutch Ship, then in Port of <hi>Malomocco,</hi> to carry unto <hi>Candia</hi> Timbers fitted, and already ſquared at <hi>Venice,</hi> for building Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; beſides which he ſent Cannon, Corn, and all Ammunition of War, with fifty thouſand Zechins in Gold for encouragement of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, with a recruit of two and twenty Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Foot, formed and collected out of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations.</p>
                  <p>Intelligence being come of the impriſonment of the Bailo at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Senate by a common and unanimous Suffrage elected <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſco Erizzo,</hi> then Doge, General of the Sea; judging, that their Arms would proſper under his Command, which had formerly been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under the auſpicious Conduct of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; and he, though a Perſon of ſeventy four Years, worn out with Age and Cares of the Publick, did yet chearfully conſecrate the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days to the Service of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But whilſt he prepared to crown the end of his Life with the Glory of this important and generous Enterprize, Death terminated all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, leaving him with the honourable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his paſt Actions, and with a Lawrel hanging over his Head, which had his Life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, had been planted on his Brows. But that this Accident might not give interruption to the weighty Affairs now in had, <hi>Molino</hi> took his place, and proceeded in his Voyage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and arrived with the Venetian Fleet at the Iſland of <hi>Corfu.</hi> In the mean time the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Fleet careened and fitted themſelves at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varine</hi> with all Neceſſaries to aſſault <hi>Candia;</hi> in which interim advice came to <hi>Canea,</hi> that the the Bailo was impriſoned at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> by a Letter from <hi>Soranço</hi> himſelf; which he had dropped from the Window of his cloſe reſtraint, and diſpatched by one of his Confidents with a Veſſel expreſs; which was not ſooner arrived, than it was that Night confirmed by all the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons or Watch-Towers of the Country; who having diſcoverd the Turkiſh Fleet far diſtant as Sea, gave a general Alarm by the Fires they made.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning being the 23/13 of <hi>June,</hi> they diſcovered the whole Fleet, near Cape <hi>Spada,</hi> which being drawn up in the form of an half Moon, took up a vaſt tract of

At length the lighter Veſſels began to edge in with the Bank of <hi>Gogna,</hi> (which is a place diſtant about eighteen miles from <hi>Canea</hi>) and were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the groſſer and heavier part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata.</p>
                  <p>And now, before I proceed farther, I ſhould make a pauſe, and deſcribe the Antiquity, the Geography, and the preſent State of this famous and renowned Iſland, but that is already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſo diſtinctly and elegantly by other Pens, that it ſhall be ſufficient for me to declare here in brief terms, how this Kingdom became the Patrimony or Poſſeſſion of <hi>Venice.</hi> In the Year 1204, a Sale thereof was made to this Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by the Marqueſs <hi>Bonifaccio</hi> of <hi>Montferratto,</hi> by an Inſtrument ſealed the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and ſigned, and delivered, in the preſence of <hi>Marco Sanudo,</hi> and <hi>Ravano du Vero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> Ambaſſadours in the time of <hi>Enrigo Dandola</hi> Doge; but the People of this Iſland not conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the ſale, oppoſed themſelves againſt it, until the Venetians by force of Arms procured their Obedience, and confirmed their purchaſe by a double Title. Hereupon ſuch noble Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens as adventured their Lives in his acquiſition, obtained the Eſtates of the Rebellious Greeks, being obliged in proportion to the Lands they held, to maintain Men and Horſe at their own Charge, and are therefore called the Feudatary Cavalry. So that the whole Country is divided into three parts; <hi>viz.</hi> the noble Venetians or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry; ſecondly, the noble Candiots, or Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which were Infantry that came to inhabit from <hi>Venice;</hi> and thirdly, the Greeks or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Country which never rebelled, but took part with the Venetian State: the firſt two ſpeak Italian, and are of the Roman Church; the others ſpeak Greek, and conſerve the Right of that Religion.</p>
                  <p>The Ottoman Fleet now touching the Shoar at <hi>Gogna,</hi> took Livery and Seizin quietly of that flouriſhing Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi> where they Encamped a while to refreſh their Forces, and prepare all things in order to their Conqueſt. In the mean time, the news hereof alarmed all <hi>Venice,</hi> and not only haſtened them in the expedition of their Fleet, but warmed their applications to all Chriſtian Princes, from whom they craved help in the general defence of Chriſtendom: which ſome at firſt imagined would have been granted, as it was once in the time of the Holy War; or that thoſe whom the Declaration of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cruſada, or Devotion, or ſenſe of Religion could not move, yet at leaſt the conſideration of their Countries Defence, or the maintenance of a Bulwark of Chriſtendom, might perſwade to wage Arms againſt the Turk, as a Common Enemy: but what cold Apprehenſions the Chriſtian Princes entertained hereof, both the faint Supplies and Aſſiſtances they adminiſtred, and their bloody and vigorous Wars one againſt another, have abundantly teſtified, to the fatal loſs and ruin of that Country. And though in the beginning there were better hopes, by means of the Pope's earneſt interceſſion with all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> to whom he ſhewed a fair Example, by uniting his own Gallies with the Venetian Fleet, and amongſt the reſt prevailed alſo with the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> to employ their Gallies in this Noble Enterprize, which tended to the Glory of God, and the common Safety and Preſervation of <hi>Italy:</hi> yet that Leaven of vain Punctilio's, which hath ſo often betrayed the Chriſtian Cauſe to the advantage of the Turk, gave a ſtop for ſome time to theſe Proceedings. For before they would enter into Arms, they deſired the Genoeſes, that the right of bearing the Flag ſhould firſt be determined in favour of their Admiral, before that of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> or <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta:</hi> And though the Pope, to take away this occaſion of diſpute, propoſed to have no other Flag worn beſides his own, under which all Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Princes, without impeachment of their Honour, as Auxiliaries, and Military Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers might promiſcuouſly wage War; yet this could not appear ſatisfactory to the Genoeſes, who not only took this occaſion to demand the precedency before <hi>Toſcany</hi> and <hi>Malta;</hi> to which the G. Duke (who was not inferiour in State, and ſuperiour in Title) and the Malteſes (who time out of mind, and by Decree of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, claimed Precedency on the Seas before them) would never aſſent; but alſo thought fit to avail themſelves in this Conjuncture, to obtain from the Pope the Grant of a Royal Court, and that Treatment which is given to Kings, or Crowned Heads. But becauſe theſe Demands ſeemed to contain thoſe Difficulties in them, which could not be granted without the manifeſt diſpleaſure of other Princes, the Pope reſolved to afford what aſſiſtance he could from himſelf, and therefore granted a Levy of a thouſand Foot out of his own Dominions, with free liberty to buy what Ammunition and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions were to be found in the Eccleſiaſtical State, with impoſition of a double Tithe or Tenth on the Goods and Dominions of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; ſo that theſe Succours of the Pope, and the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>Naples, Toſcany,</hi> and <hi>Malta,</hi> under the Command of Prince <hi>Ludoviſio,</hi> General of the Church, being united to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Fleet, did ſpeedily compoſe a moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and formidable Force; however, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Diſſentions amongſt the Commanders, and other Misfortunes derived from thence, to the Chriſtian Arms, nothing ſucceeded fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately this Year. For the Turks having gained their landing at firſt without oppoſition, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Chriſtians in ſeveral ſmall Skirmiſhes, and afterwards forced <hi>Canea,</hi> the ſecond City of that Iſland, which they took with much blood and ſlaughter of the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The Turks having made ſo ſucceſsful a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs this firſt Year, as to poſſeſs themſelves of one of the moſt conſiderable Cities, took Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to proceed in their Conqueſts; in which they had the fortune to make themſelves Maſters in the next place of <hi>Retimo;</hi> in defence of which, the General <hi>Andrea Cornaro,</hi> loſt his Life by a Musket ſhot. Nor more ſucceſsful were the Venetians this Year at Sea; for what with Quarrels among the Commanders, and with their coldneſs and negligence in their Buſineſs, they ſuffered the Turkiſh Veſſels to paſs freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them that interruption which was very facil to Men reſolute and concerned: Nor was the opportunity which preſented to ruine the Turkiſh Fleet made uſe of, then lying half diſarmed, and ill provided, at the Iſle of St. <hi>Theodoro,</hi> (which is a Rock oppoſite to <hi>Canea</hi>) where at that time, it is believed, they might all have been burned, had the occaſion been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, agreeable to that Advantage which then offered: ſo that towards the latter end of the Year, the General <hi>Molino</hi> returning Home, either by reaſon of ſome diſtemper, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation from the Senate, which ſeemed to be ill ſatisfied with his ill Fortune, or his ill Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Publick Affairs; he was diſmiſſed
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:39539:34"/>from his high Charge. And <hi>Gio. Capello,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> was conſtituted in his place.</p>
                  <p>This Year was remarkable for the ruinous Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> Baronet, our King's Ambaſſador then reſiding at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the Turky Company. The Original of which ſeemed to ariſe from the Civil Diſſentions at Home; for ſo unhappy were thoſe Times, and ſo ill affected were Engliſh Minds with Rancour and Malice againſt each other, that this Leaven of Diſcord could not be confined within the Banks of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ſeemed to diffuſe it ſelf over the Seas, and as a Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, infected the Minds, Goods, and Intereſts of the Engliſh, to what Quarter or Climate ſoever they were tranſported.</p>
                  <p>In the Year 1638, Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> was, with the Conſent and Approbation of the Turky Company, dignified by his Majeſty with the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Authority of his Ambaſſador to the Grand Signior. For Maintenance and Support of which, the ſaid Company were to pay him the yearly Sum of five thouſand Zechins, in four e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Proportions, which is above the value of two thouſand Pounds <hi>Sterling.</hi> And farther, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure from <hi>England,</hi> paid him ſix hundred Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> towards the Furniture of his Houſe, Plate, and other Neceſſaries; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying all the Charges expended for Tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Lady, Followers, and Proviſions to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> from the time of his arrival at the Ottoman Court, until the end of the Year 1645, managed the Affairs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to their general Satisfaction, and with the Eſteem and Honour of the Turkiſh Miniſters, who conſidered him as a Perſon of Courage and Reſolution, and in every way qualified for that Employment.</p>
                  <p>At length Differences aroſe between this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador and the Company, touching the Right and Title to that Benefit which is called<note n="‖" place="margin">
                        <hi>Strangers Conſulage</hi> is <hi>2</hi> in the hundred, in the value of all the goods belonging to Stranger-Merchants, laden on Engliſh Ships, and all other Ships which not being in amity with the G.

The others challenging the ſame, as the chief and principal Means they had to eaſe the vaſt Expences they were at, for maintenance of their Trade and Government; for which they had always contended and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Power of preceding Ambaſſadors, and which Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> himſelf ſeems, by an Article which he had made with the Company to have relinquiſhed to them in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>That during the time of his Employment as Ambaſſador, he would content himſelf with ſuch Allowance from the ſaid Company for his Pains and Care to be taken in their Buſineſs, as is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the ſaid Articles, being 5000 Zechins <hi>per Annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Right of <hi>Strangers Conſulage,</hi> is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to the <hi>Turky Company,</hi> by virtue of their Charter which his Majeſty was pleaſed, in the Year of his Happy Reſtauration, graciouſly to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, Confirm, and Amplify to them; the which was more eaſily granted, by the concurrent Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſea,</hi> then deſigned for Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> who on ſome Conſiderations offered from the ſaid Company, aſſented thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But Matters of a higher Nature than this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed the Accounts and Differences between the Ambaſſador and Company. For firſt, one <hi>John Wolfe,</hi> at that time Treaſurer at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becoming Inſolvent for great Sums of Mony, Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> alledged, that thoſe Debts were National, ariſing from the late Changes of State Officers, their extravagant Exactions, and Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Practices: and therefore to extinguiſh this Publick Debt, he made a Leviation of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten thouſand, nine hundred and fifty Dollars on the Engliſh Eſtates at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> detaining the Companies Ships in thoſe Ports, until the aforeſaid Debt was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and cleared. The Ground and Cauſe of which, will more plainly appear by this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Warrant.</p>

We having taken pains in drawing the ſaid Accompts to a Head, and for diſcovery of the Truth thereof; and (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Certificate being directed thereon) for the more formal Satisfaction only of the ſaid Company, being advertiſed that ſome of thoſe who with us have had the view, and been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Examination of the ſaid Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, whom it concerns on the Companies behalf to make ſuch Certificate, on our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for ſome private Reſpects, make ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to certify the ſaid Debts, as they appeared before us and them: And hearing alſo that the General Ships here in Port, and that at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> prepare, and make haſte to be gone: In Providence, as well for own ſafety in the Premiſſes, as for that due regard we owe to his Majeſty's Honour, and the Publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for the future, We find it requiſite, and hereby order and require, that until the ſaid Debts ſhall be fully declared, and their pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſetled by Leviation, and the ſame paid

                  <p>The <hi>Turkie</hi> Company was altogether unfatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this Leviation, alledging that a great part of this Debt aroſe from Monies lent by Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> himſelf to <hi>Wolfe,</hi> at a high In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; for ſecuring of which, and of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, he had in this manner taxed and charged their Eſtates. But Troubles and Differences ended not with this Paiment; for ſtill the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy about Strangers Conſulage was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, which with other Matters, cauſed great Heats and Animoſities on both ſides: So that ſome of the <hi>Turkie</hi> Company, Men of the better Principles, thought it moſt adviſable to Petition his Majeſty to conſtitute another Ambaſſador, with Letters of Revocation, to recal this; but others, who were the zealous Men of thoſe Times, who had taſted the ſweetneſs of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and proved it to be the Grand Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon of all Remedies, perſwaded that his Eſtate ſhould be Sequeſtred.

                  <p>To perform and put in execution the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Warrant, it was neceſſary to make uſe of the Turkiſh Officers Power, and Authority: Wherefore Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> demanding Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Grand Vizier, and repreſenting Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto him in that manner, as he judged moſt agreeable to his Cauſe, was heard by him with a gentle and gracious Ear; and aſſurances made to him of all Reſpect, Favour, and Aſſiſtance imaginable. For the Turks had now ſmelt out a Cauſe in Tranſaction, which with good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement might be worth them many Purſes of Mony; and was of ſuch a Nature, as that their Religion, and Doctrine, obliged them to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, having the proſpect of gaining Mony, and enflaming Chriſtian Diſcord. On theſe Grounds Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> eaſily obtained Commands from the Vizier, directed to the Kadi of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to act all things according to direction of him the Ambaſſador; and to enforce Matters with better execution, a Chaous, or Purſuivant, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with <hi>John Hetherington,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo Zuma</hi> Interpreter, was diſpatched to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> with Commands to carry up the Conſul and Factors to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to break open the Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and make ſeizure on ſuch Eſtates belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Turkie</hi> Company, as would anſwer the Demands and Pretentions of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Accordingly the Conſul and Factory were carried up, and with that other of <hi>Galata,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Ambaſſador's Houſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Agents at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> with aſſiſtance of the Kadi, ſealed up all the Merchants Ware-houſes; but when it came to execution and Seizure, more Difficulties aroſe; for the Turks, Armenians, and Jew-Merchants, made high Clamours to the Juſtice, that many of the Goods belonged unto them, ſome were not yet paid for, others were only Pawns in the Engliſh Hands; and all the Town being deſirous to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Cauſe of the Merchants, a great Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar and Hubbub aroſe amongſt the People: The Kadi affrighted hereat, grew more ſlack and faint in his Proceedings; but the Cordial of 1500 Dollars, and Gratuities to his Servants, overcame the Difficulties, and gave him new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; ſo that at length, being attended with the Principal Officers of the Town, he began firſt with the Conſul's Houſe, making Seiſure, and delivering out of the Ware-houſes all the Goods found there; with ſome Caution howſoever, and reſpect to thoſe Pretenſions which Stranger-Merchants made thereunto; as appears by the following Letters.</p>

                        <p>YEſterday we received your Lordſhips of the <hi>4th</hi> preſent, being the Copy of the <hi>3d:</hi> And to day we received your Lordſhips's of the <hi>8th,</hi> and rejoice to hear your Lordſhip is in ſuch a readineſs for your juſt Demands, and wiſh your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip leſs Trouble, and better Succeſs than we this day have had, and we doubt for many days ſhall incounter here. This morning the Cadie's Son, with his Neipe and principal Officers came; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt with the Conſul's Houſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we began, 'twas ſpoken in the Kad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die's own Houſe, and all over the Town, our Deſign to ſeize what we could find; about ſeven a Clock his Son came and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Conſul's Houſe, and opened all the Warehouſes, and took from thence, with <hi>Elford</hi>'s and <hi>Keeble</hi>'s, ſome four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Clothes, and nine Bales Mohairs; we left behind us 38 Bales of Silk, 13 Bales his Servant pretended were ſold by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> to be paid by Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and when advice came the Bills were paid, the Goods ſhould be delivered; in the mean time they lie in Mr. <hi>Lancelot</hi>'s Warehouſe, with ſome 40 Clothes, 60 Barrels of Tin, which Tin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Mr. <hi>Sainthill,</hi> and ſealed up by the Neipe and us. Before we had ended at this Houſe, the whole Town was in an Uprore, being fomented by Jews, and ſome of the young Fry left behind, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed in the Streets, that the Town would be undone, the Trade loſt and go to wrack, if this was ſuffered; ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conſul's Door were ſo many of the ſcum of the Town, the Streets were packed thick of them. On the other ſide, a more unruly Enemy threatned worſe things, the Maſter of the Golden Lion, who had before given <hi>Barnardiſton</hi> 9000
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:39539:36"/>Dollars at <hi>Cambio,</hi> and had no Goods in his Poſſeſſion, hearing how it would fare with them, Lands forty Men at <hi>Barnardiſtons</hi>'s Houſe, and vowed he would have his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Goods, or ſwore he would beat down the Town; ſo likewiſe the <hi>Jonas</hi> got her Sails to Yards, that the Kaddie's Son and the Chiouz, deſired to let it alone until a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day, for fear of worſe Events: So when they had made an end at <hi>Lancelot</hi>'s Houſe, would ſtay no longer, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come another day.. The Eſtate before mentioned we carried away in ſpight of Envy, and have put it up in a ſafe Cane. As ſoon as this was done, becauſe the Captain would not come aſhore, I got <hi>Jordan</hi> to go aboard the Golden Lion, and know the Maſter his Intent, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with the Danger might enſue thereon; all we could urge was nothing, except he had ſatisfaction for his 9000 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; at laſt told him, if we knew where his Eſtate lay, we would endeavour to help him to it; ſo he found it out, and we delivered it to him, and the Man was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied. And now we hope to find little Impediment, and to morrow Morning the Caddie's Son promiſeth to come again, and we doubt not the ſame day but to make an end. If your Lordſhip ſaw the little regard theſe People bear to the Grand Signior's Commands, the Caddie, or ought elſe but their private Ends, your Lordſhip would (as we hope your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip will) not blame us if we procured but the half of what your Lordſhip's Letter mentions. To morrow (if God bleſs us) we ſhall ſend your Lorſhip more punctual Advice, and for the preſent crave leave to ſubſcribe our ſelves,</p>

                        <p>OUrs of the <hi>16th</hi> adviſed your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how with the Caddie's Son, his Niepe, and Chia, we had entred the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Lancelott,</hi> and taken into our poſſeſſion the Goods we found therein, not pretended unto by Strangers; and how by the inſolency of <hi>Nicholas Terrick,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the <hi>Hopewell,</hi> (formerly the <hi>Golden Lion</hi>) we were interrupted that day from proceeding any farther; and how by the means of Captain <hi>Jordan,</hi> we had pacified that young, raſh, and undiſcreet Man; and that we hoped the next Morning to proceed without interruption, but it fell not our ſo: for the next Morning we went to <hi>Barnardiſton</hi>'s Houſe, thinking to make all ſure there; and when we had begun, in comes the Maſter with a Crew of his own, and ſaid, thoſe Goods he had recieved were not ſufficient to give him ſatisfaction, and demanded of us the reſt. We anſwered, We could not give him theſe Goods we had ſealed up before he came into Port, for wat he demanded; but aſſured him if he knew of any thing ſtanding out, we would endeavour, the beſt we could, for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: Upon this, as we underſtood ſince, a young Man of the Houſe whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered the Maſter in his Ear, and told him, if he were not ſatisfied before the Goods went out of the Houſe, all was loſt, he would never have a Penny of it: Upon this, away goes the Maſter aboard, with this young Man in his company, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Sails, but threatned nothing. Upon this come in the Jews, and told the Niepe and the Chia, that the Maſter would ſhoot down the Town; but for all our perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that he durſt not, away runs the Niepe &amp; his Company, and leaves us there alone: ſo we reſolved to have done it our ſelves; but the Merchants had ſo worked with the Hamalls, that there was not one to be ſeen; ſo being alone, and ſeeing his Boat coming aſhore, well mann'd, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſurprize, we preſently repaired to the Chiouzes, and deſired him to go with us to the Caddies, to ſee if we could have any better aſſiſtance from him. By this time the Town was in a great Uproar, and the People ſomething too inſolent; the Caddie, to prevent the worſt, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſed the Shops to be ſhut up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent for all the chief Men of the Town, (who by Preſents before we had made our Friends) and there before them all, and a great company of the Townſmen, cauſe the Commands to be read, and told them how much they were bound to ſee the Grand Signior's Commands put in execution, and what diſhonour it would be for one Ship to command the Town.. So after they had diſputed the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, the Caddie ſends an Officer aboard (accompanied with the Druggermen to the Nation) to know whether he would hinder the proſecution of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior's Command, or no, and to know his Anſwer? He preſently denied he ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſhoot at the Town, only deſired his own: So preſently after the People were a little appeaſed, we went to work a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo this day have finiſhed all: it being done in ſuch confuſion, we cannot give your Lordſhip that exact Accompt
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:39539:36"/>you may expect within a day or two; for then we will ſend your Lordſhip the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, with the Values; in mean time we ſtand upon our Guard, having ſome 20 or 30 of the Souldiers of the Caſtle to keep watch every night; for (my Lord!) here is no ſmall Hobbub in the Town, and threatning both of us and the Eſtate, but we will ſecure both as well as we can. We have ſent your Lordſhip a rough Draught of what we have, and what we have left ſealed up, and find it fall ſhort far of what your Lordſhip expected: the ſooner your Lordſhip diſpoſes of it, the better; for aſſure your ſelf, there is daily ſome Deſign or other hatching: We ſhould be very ſorry, after all this, to have it miſcarry, therefore pray (my Lord!) diſpoſe of it (to prevent the worſt) as ſoon as you may. Your Lordſhip was pleaſed to inorder us to change our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being too near the Water-ſide, and in a Merchant's Houſe; which, as ſoon as we can get a ſecure Houſe, we will; but the farther from the Water-ſide, the more dangerous, if the People of the Country ſhould intend us any ill.</p>
                        <p>The French, and many others, pretend Debts of many of thoſe People that are gone up, and would know who ſhall pay them, and pretend to be paid out of their Eſtates; but we have put them off, telling them, we believe your Lordſhip will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let your Eſtate go to pay their Debts; nevertheleſs, ſhall adviſe your Lordſhip of it: ſo have ſecured none, only to one <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoone Amet</hi> Aga, one of the chief Men in the Town here, Mr. <hi>Lancelott</hi> having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him a Bill of Exchange for 475 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the Bill returned unpaid, we were forced to deliver into the Hangee's Hands, for his Security, 10 Cloathes.</p>
                        <p>We have given the Ships liberty to lade, by reaſon of their continual grumbling, but fear our Deſign on the <hi>Jonas</hi> will not take; for the Caddie ſeeing the ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Terrick,</hi> will not aſſiſt us as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.

                  <p>Matters running thus high, and the Breach made ſo wide, there remained little hopes of an Accommodation: For now the Merchants at <hi>Galata,</hi> having obtained their Liberty from the Ambaſſador's Houſe, by the Vizier's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, entred into a Conſultation in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to govern their Affairs, electing ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Men to that Employment, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Name of the <hi>Sealed Knot,</hi> which much provoked the Anger of Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow,</hi> and more, becauſe that deſerting his Protection, they made Applications to the Heer <hi>Coppes,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent for the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> who readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the defence of their Cauſe, and willingly repreſented to the Grand Vizier the Aggrievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ill Treatment of which they complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                        <p>After his Lordſhip had cauſed the ſtay of the Ships in this Port, and at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> under pretence of this State's requiring it, in reſpect of their Wars with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> Merchant, having been here almoſt ſeven Months, to the great loſs and damage of Ships and Goods; he picks a quarrel with the Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> for not complying accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Order, in the paiment of their Parts of the laſt Leviation-Mony; and hereupon ſends down <hi>John Hetherington</hi> one of his Servants, a moſt lewd, debaucht, prophane, riotous Fellow, (yet his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Kinſman) accompanied with two Chiouzes, two Druggermen, a Janizary, and other Servants, to proceed with thoſe who ſhould refuſe to pay their Leviation according to the Inſtructions he had given the ſaid <hi>Hetherington,</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo Zuma,</hi> Druggerman: But before the arrival of theſe Agents, the Nation there had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the paiment by an Obligatory Letter to his Lordſhip; this would not ſatisfy, nor depoſition of Goods for Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, until Anſwer ſhould come from hence of the paiment of their Bills of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:39539:37"/>Exchange, which was tendred; but the ſecond day after their arrival, <hi>Hetherington</hi> and his Retinue goes to the Caddie's, and thither cauſes the Conſul and all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to come; where it was pretended they had laden the <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> with Corn, and ſent her away; and therefore, by virtue of an Imperial Command, (ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry privately here procured) the Conſul, and ſix more of the Nation, were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered into the Hands of the Chiouz, and ſo brought up hither, not being ſuffered to return to their own Houſes, but put a day and a night into an offenſive dark place, the Doors and Windows not only ſhut, but nailed upon them, not ſuffering either their Friends or Servants to come at them, or a Window open till the evening, for which alſo they paid Dollars 100. In this diſgraceful manner they were brought hither, where they have been ſince the <hi>22d</hi> of the laſt Month, Priſoners in his Lordſhip's Houſe to the <hi>21ſt</hi> preſent, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they had complied in paying the Leviation Monies in leſs than a Week after their arrivals; and by fair Promiſes, put off from day to day, for their diſpatch to their Buſineſs at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which could not but much ſuffer by their abſence: Their magazines and Counting-houſes continued ſealed from the time of their Attachments; the Spips not permitted to lade, or depart, though empty; and no Debts due to them would be paid in this their Abſence and time of Diſtraction.</p>
                        <p>The Leviation Monies being ſatisfied, (of which Dollars 31000, his Lordſhip forced into <hi>Cancellaria</hi>); and we of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> expecting no more rubs in the way, his Lordſhip, the <hi>16th</hi> Inſtant, calls a Court, and there declared, That of what Monies had been collected, there would not remain much on the old Accompt; therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion muſt be made for the future growing Charge, for ſo much as upon this pretended Imbargo, no Ships would come in haſte, and he and his muſt be maintained, which he would provied for: Hereupon, when we could not do otherwiſe, Dollars 25000 was promiſed, half by this Factory, for which his Lordſhip cauſed us to enter into Bond, as he did thoſe of <hi>Smyrna</hi> for the other half; this being effected, which we ſhould not neither altogether have been ſo ready to have complied in, but thereby to put a period to all other Demands, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able our ſelves to proceed in our Buſineſs for your Worſhips better Service.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>18th</hi> preſent his Lordſhip calls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Court; and after arguing of ſome General Matters, with a ſeeming ſadneſs, tells us how that he had been wronged by falſe Information from hence and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> (but he was ſo far from proving it, as that he would not diſcover ſo much as whom he ſuſpected) and thereupon the <hi>Levant</hi> Company at Home had, by means of the Parliament, procured Sequeſtration of his Eſtate and Lands in <hi>England,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſurprize his Perſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, according to Religion, Reaſon, and common Policy, he ought to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Hoſtages; and thereupon he departed from us, requiring the Nation ſpeedily to reſolve of ſome preſent Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that might ſecure his Eſtate at Home, and perſon here, otherwiſe he vowed to God, he would ſuddenly do it himſelf, with no little diſadvantage to our ſelves and Principals. Theſe ſtrange, unreaſonable, and unexpected Demands, filled us with amazement, not knowing what Anſwer to give to ſuch a groundleſs demand; we deſired the Secretary Signior <hi>Dominico</hi> to know his Lordſhips more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deſires therein, that ſo we might better underſtand him, and to put his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands into ſuch a moderate way, as he might receive ſome Satisfaction. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned us Anſwer, that we muſt reſolve to ſatisfy his aforeſaid Demands before we went thence: Whereupon the Gates were ſhut, and alſo Guards ſet upon us, that we ſhould not converſe with any, or convey ſo much as a Paper out of Doors. Thus we are all ſurprized, made cloſe Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and our Counting-houſe, Ware-houſe, and Chambers ſealed up, to make ſure of our Goods and Eſtates there alſo. Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in this ſad Condition all Night, and finding no Motion to proceed from his Lordſhip to declare himſelf farther, four or five of us was appointed by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, perſonally to crave his Lordſhip's particular Deſires and Demands of us: Whoſe Anſwer was, That the loweſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue he could put upon his Lands the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had ſequeſtred, was 25000 pounds <hi>Sterling;</hi> and for the loſs he ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain by being put out of the Ambaſſador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which he ſaith his Majeſty hath granted him for his Life; therefore the Strangers Conſulage he rates at Dollars 5000 <hi>per Annum;</hi> which for the clear Gain of ſeven Years to come, is Dollars 35000; for which he declared that he would not accept of any Perſonal Security or Obligation whatſoever, but a preſent diſpoſition of Dollars 160000 in Mony or Goods, into his own hands muſt be made. And if to this we would not condeſcend, he told us, That he at the laſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had vowed to God (as he doth now) to ſacrifice his Eſtate, Himſelf, Wiſe and Children, for the execution of this his abſolute Intent; and till then, neither our Perſons, Eſtates, Ships here, or at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ſhould be free. We told his Lordſhip, that finding not any of us had heard of any ſuch Things was (or intended to be) done againſt him by the Company, it would give us great Satisfaction, to ſhew
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:39539:37"/>us thoſe Advices he grounded this Pretence upon. To this no Anſwer was then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by himſelf, but diſmiſſed us, leaving it to our laſt and ſpeedy Reſolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was reſolved to ſtrike home. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he ſent us word by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That he could not let his Honour deſcend ſo low, as to ſhew his Advices to any. This empty Reply, gave us too much reaſon, not only to conclude this to be a feigned Pretence, but made us ſufpect his Intention and Aim was at all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's Eſtate in the Country; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we returned him this reaſonable and defenſive Anſwer, as your Worſhips will particularly perceive by the incloſed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: whereunto is adjoined his Reply to that our Anſwer, as he pretended; tho it appears it was intended before, it being dated a day before our Anſwer. Whilſt thus we continued, it happened that thoſe four of us were fortunately abſent from Court that day, who hearing of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, wherefore, and why we were thus detained, and what an ill Period theſe Proceedings tended unto, if not timely and prudently prevented; they uſed their beſt endeavours to free us and your Livelihoods from the Claws of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Covetouſneſs; they applied themſelves to Signor <hi>Illuſtriſſimo Coppes,</hi> the States of <hi>Hollands</hi> Agent: who as he was ever a Friend and Favourer of the Nation, ſo now he gave us good and great teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thereof in this our greateſt Need and Extremity: and chiefly by his means with a Sum of Mony; together with the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the Jews, and many other of the Grand Signior's Subjects againſt this our preſent Abuſe, and deſtruction of future Trade: The Vizier (whom they had well and ſully poſſeſſed with the Truth of all Things) after three days Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſent a Chiouz for us to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Houſe, from whence we were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Vizier, who much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided his Lordſhip, ſaying, He never gave him Commands for ſuch Proceedings, notwithſtanding his Lordſhip's avaneous Allegations againſt his own Nation, by ſaying, an Engliſh Ship at <hi>Smyrna</hi> was la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Powder, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there reſided for aſſiſtance of the Turks Enemies; and other the like Abuſes, and deſtructive Courſes againſt thoſe here; tending not only to the confiſcation of Ships and Eſtates, but the riſgo of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving our Bodies, if not the loſs of all or ſome of our Lives, had his Helliſh Plots taken effect. The next day after our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Commitment, arrives five more of our fellow Factors from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> there ſeized upon and made Priſoners; and ſo by his Lordſhip's Command, in that nature brought to his Houſe, and put amongſt us, notwithſtanding the advice from, their Correſpondents hence was at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their departure thence) that their part of Leviation Mony was all paid in here; yet their Leviation, with one third more in Monies and Goods, was takne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from them by his impudently impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters there, and all the reſt of their Goods continued ſealed up: So the Intent (as your Worſhips may plainly perceive) was no other than firſt to get the Monies here paid, then to ſeize upon their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and next to take away and ſecure their Eſtates; thereby to prevent a juſt, reaſonable, and natural Defence; and now it too plainly appears, (becauſe his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Imployers had taken courſe no Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers ſhould come unto us); Horſemen are daily diſpatched unto us by our Friends at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> adviſing us to the <hi>20th</hi> Inſtant, of the unnatural and devouring Progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they had there made; which was done by the aſſiſtance of the Caddie, whom they had well bribed, beginning to act there at the ſame time as we were here all impriſoned; ſo there was no intent of ſtaying for our Anſwer to his extravagant Demands. They firſt fell upon Mr. <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celot</hi>'s Houſe, thence proceed all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Nation; ſo that they have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away all the Goods, Monies, and Effects whatſoever they could find in their Houſes, at Home or Abroad, but broke open and ranſack'd all our Chambers, Trunks, and Counting-houſes, which mounteth to a far greater value than his demands of Dollars 160000; and by large Promiſes to Informers, endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover and take what is owing them abroad by People of the Country; and have ſo threatned our Friends and Servants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver our Books, and declare where's more of our Eſtates, that they are conſtrained to leave our naked Houſes to the open World, and betake themſelves to the Ships in Port for Refuge. All this it ſeems contents them not, but are contriving Proviſions, by policy and force of ſome Rogues of the Country, to unlade what Goods the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had put on board the <hi>Jonas.</hi> For all which, we have not only the advice of our diſtreſſed Friends there, but ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Information, as your Worſhips may perceive by the incloſed authentick Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Letters from his Inſtruments at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to his Lordſhip here; by which you will too plainly perceive his Lordſhip did, and ſtill doth aim at all the Eſtate the Nation had in the Country; and for that cauſe he was ſo much enraged for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the <hi>Hercules,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> whoſe Goods he eſteemed as ſo much loſs to him.</p>
                        <p>We have been now ſeven days out of his Lordſhip's hands, and are endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to free that Eſtate they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as alſo to defend
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:39539:38"/>our Selves and your Eſtates in future from him, and free the Ships out of Port, (which no queſtion at laſt will be proved have been detained by his Lordſhip to this ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) and if poſſible, to procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of Dollars, 20 in 30000, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip hath unavoidably forced from us in the Leviation Accompt, upon ſtrange Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. All which (by the aſſiſtance of our obliged and worthy Friend <hi>Signior Illuſtriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo Coppes;</hi> together with the expence of Dollars 30 in 40000, to the Vizier and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turkiſh Miniſters) we doubt not but ſpeedily to effect; for without this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt defenſive Remedy, we can expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ruin to all your Eſtate in the Country, which ſtill he threatneth, and endeavours by all his deviliſh Policy and Means to effect: But the Vizier, and the two Caddeleskiers, who are our Judges, are ſo poſſeſt with the Truth and Reaſon of our Cauſe, as well by the People of the Country, as our Selves, that they have given us full aſſurance, by Promiſes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, and ſound Probabilities, that our juſt Demands ſhall be accompliſhed; for which we all faithfully and earneſtly endeavour Night and Day, and ſo do hourly expect a good determination of it: and till there be an Iſſue or Settlement given to this our confuſed Condition, (which we hope will not continue for many days) no particular Principal muſt expect Advice from any Factor here, becauſe no private Man can fitly adviſe any thing, till the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Buſineſs be better ordered: And as we proceed therein, we ſhall by all Ways and Conveyances give your Worſhips a true and exact Account. We do humbly beſeech your Worſhips to acknowledg the good Offices of the State's Agent to their Ambaſſador with you, and ſo fully certify him, that Illuſtr. Sign. <hi>Coppes</hi> appeared no ways againſt his Lordſhip as Ambaſſador, or trenching on the King's Honour, but reſpectfully and modeſtly for the ſafety of your Eſtates.</p>
                        <p>To particularize all Paſſages and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in this Buſineſs, would prove more troubleſom than needful to your Worſhips, ſo pleaſe to accept of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; for this is the preſent ſtat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>His Lordſhip's Cauſe is ſo bad, that Signor <hi>Dominico</hi> your Secretary, Signior <hi>George,</hi> and all other Druggermen, have not only declined his Lordſhip, but apply themſelves to us, (and eſpecially the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer). In fine, we conceive his Lordſhip finds his former bad Proceedings have made him uncapable to return into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and alſo uncertain of his Reſidence here; which, together with the improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent uſe he hath made of his Golden Time, that he intended to ſeize upon all He and his unworthy Inſtruments could catch hold of; for to this purpoſe he diverted the <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fleece</hi>'s advantagious Deſign for <hi>Venice;</hi> which at firſt was approved and cauſed by his own conſent; and occaſioned her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor here, to whom ſhe was conſigned, to let her him to fraight, that ſo Himſelf, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and undue gotten Eſtate, may be conveyed (as in ſuppoſed) into <hi>France,</hi> with whoſe Ambaſſador, there hath been often a more than ordinary correſpondency of late.</p>

                           <p>Before the ſealing up of our Letter, we have procured an Imperial Command for the recovering of the Eſtate into our Hands, taken away at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> as alſo for the attaching the Perſons, and bringing thoſe good Agents of his Lordſhips hither, to anſwer their Proceedings and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: the obtaining of which Command, we are not a little glad of, being our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory Teſtimony of the Vizier's being our Friend, and ties him thereby to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo, which we hope effectually to find, two days hence, when his Lordſhip is to appear with us before him; but in caſe he refuſeth (as already he hath done) the Vizier will give Sentence againſt him.</p>
                           <p>Your Worſhips may be pleaſed to take notice, that his Lordſhip's chief Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, in theſe his undue Proceedings, is Mr. <hi>Henry Hyde,</hi> of whoſe good Service in your former Occaſions at the <hi>Morea,</hi> we need not to give teſtimony; but can aſſure your Worſhips, that ſince his coming hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath occaſioned great Diſturbance among the Nation; and now at laſt (had the Deſign before mentioned taken effect) mingt have raiſed his decayed Fortunes, by the ruin of Yours and our Eſtates; but, thanks be to God, the Counſel of <hi>Achitophel</hi> is truned into Folly. And for your late Treaſurer <hi>John Woolf,</hi> the ſatisfying of whoſe Debts hath ſo mounted the laſt Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, he is ſo far from acknowledging the Courteſies done in acquitting him from his Creditors, that he is become Aſſiſtant (though a weak one) to his Lordſhip in the Proceeding aforementioned: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deſerted <hi>Galata,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Henry

                        <opener>
                           <salute>Right Worſhipful Sirs,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>IT may pleaſe you, our laſt from hence was by the Ship <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> adviſing his Lordſhips Proceedings for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Leviation, for diſcharging your Debts at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being then informed that the whole amounted unto Dollars 118109; and how we were reſolved to withſtand it, until your Worſhips further Pleaſure ſhould be ſignified unto us concerning the ſame, for ſuch Reaſons as we then preſumed to lay open unto you; and that in the mean time we had preſented our Grievances to his Lordſhip's gracious peruſal, the Copy whereof went annexed to our ſaid Letter, to both which you may pleaſe to have refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following, our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul called a Court, and declared his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Anſwer to our ſaid Letter, diſliking our Proceedings; and by a new Order pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the lading of Goods, and receiving them on Board, and the departure of Ships, until the ſaid Leviation were paid, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his former Order, and Schedule now ſet down, ſhewing each Man his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable part for his Factory of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> amounting in all to Dollars 54950, and for the Factory at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to Dollars 56000, is together Dollars 110950. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, we generally deſired that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be pleaſed to ſuſpend the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſaid Order of Leviation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch time we ſhould receive your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips farther Order about it, without which we our ſelves were like to pay it out of our own Purſes, as in the laſt Leviation; receiving ſince particular Orders from ſome of our Principals, not to pay any Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, otherwiſe it ſhould be for our own Accompts, and not theirs.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> the Conſul called another Court, ſignifying unto us, that his Lorſhip did require an account for the departure of the Ship <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> and <hi>Succeſs,</hi> contrary to his Lordſhip's Commands, there being an Officer of the Vizier's come down to apprehend Captain <hi>Tho. Porter,</hi> and to carry him up to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> (which Ships departed at their own pleaſures, being not in our powers to ſtay them.) And that concerning the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation it was inevitable, and his Lordſhip was reſolved upon it, and therefore would force us unto it, and expect repair of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from the Delinquents. Whereupon fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Lordſhip's farther diſpleaſure, which might beget ſome greater Inconveniences amongſt us, we preſumed to yield unto his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:39539:39"/>Lordſhip's Commands, by way of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive orderly complyance, and conform our ſelves unto the paiment of our parts of the ſaid Leviation, in proportion to the Eſtates were received on the laſt general Ships, <hi>Hercules, Sampſon,</hi> and <hi>Smyrna-Merchant,</hi> according to our particular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſments; as appeareth by our general Letter preſented to his Lordſhip, and entred in Cancellaria, grounded upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of this days Court; deſiring his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be pleaſed to allow us four Months time for paiment, for ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as we have alledged in the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> the Conſul told us he had received other Letters from his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, prohibiting not only the Lading of Goods, and the Departure of any Ships, until the Leviation be ſetled; but alſo therein more fully ſignifies and declares, That until the Grand Signior's Fleet be gone forth, he cannot permit any Ship, either at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> or here, to lade or be diſpatched; and that accordingly his Lordſhip is ſo required of this State. And in like manner hath ordered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thoſe whom it concerns, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and in this Port, to obſerve the ſame. And moreover farther witneſſing, which accordingly (as he ſaid) he was bound to acquaint us, how that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and here, was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded; and his Lordſhip, to avoid far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dangers and Inconveniences to the Publick, could not refuſe his Conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> arrived here Mr. <hi>John Hetherington,</hi> a Servant to his Lorſhip, and Signow <hi>Lorenzo Zuma</hi> a Greek, one of his Lordſhip's Druggermen, from <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> who the next Morning moved our Conſul to call a Court for the Nation; where being aſſembled, the Conſul told the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> That their Deſires were performed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore required them to deliver what they had in Commiſſion from his Lordſhip: who produced an Order of the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> directed to the Conſul and Us, for paiment of the ſaid Leviation forthwith, or elſe to proceed according to his farther Order, Warrant, and Inſtructions in ſuch behalf; and we to be anſwerable to ſuch Loſs, Damage, and Inconveniencies as may enſue thereby. To which we anſwered, That the Leviation was ſubſcribed unto, and therefore deſired the ſaid <hi>Hehterington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> to ſtay four or five days, until his Lordſhio ſhould return Anſwer to our Letter of the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Lorenzo</hi> told us, He would retire and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe hsi Lordſhip's Commiſſion, and in two hours return, to have a more full and ſatisfactory Anſwer from us: which being expired, he declared, That his Lordſhip's Commiſſion required forthwith ready Mony or Goods, (being hsi Inſtruction, from which he could not vary). Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>John Lancelot</hi> firſt anſwered, (as he was a Merchant) He could not depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit his Cloth, for his Credit's ſake, but would give his Bills for his and Mr. <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Breat</hi>'s proportionable part of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, payable at <hi>Conſtantinople per</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Pigot,</hi> at five days ſight, into his Lordſhip's <hi>Cancellaria;</hi> which was refuſed, unleſs they would depoſit the value in Cloth, and one third part more towards Charges, in the poſſeſſion of him the ſaid <hi>Lorenzo;</hi> which they ſaid again, for their Credits ſake (as they were Merchants) could not conſent unto; ſo referred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the ſaid <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, if theſe Proffers would not be accepted of, being not poſſible for them at preſent to procure Monies at Intereſt, or otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>The like Conditions we all in general proffered for our proportionable parts, but were refuſed by the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo.</hi> Whereupon the Conſul told them, they had all our Aſſents for pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Leviation; and if that, with ſuch Reaſons and Proffers as propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might not be ſatisfactory, the Conſus, and we in general, referred our ſelves to the ſaid <hi>Lorenzo</hi>'s farther Proceedings.</p>
                        <p>After this, the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> preſently repaired to the Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, accompanied with a prime Chiouz of the Vizier's, and declared their farther Commiſſions: After publication whereof, the Caddie ſent for the Conſul, and all our Nation, where the Capitulations were firſt taken away by Warrant, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul in a moſt barbarous manner was laid hold on, with <hi>Dixwell Breat, Daniel Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, John Pixley, Samuel Barnardiſtion, George Hanger,</hi> and <hi>James Moyer,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Priſoners into Cuſtody of the ſaid Chiouz and Officers, and tranſported to a Houſe (taken by them on purpoſe) where they were violently, and in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable manner, thruſt into a dark Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and at length were forced to preſent Dollars 300, to have a Window ſet open to give them Light and Air; the Conſul telling the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> before he was ſurpriſed, in the preſence of the Caddies, That neither he, or the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had any ways tranſgreſſed the Grand Signior's, or his Lordſhip's Commands, and that he did not fear what they could do unto him, no not ſo much as to die, in performance of his Faith and Truſt to the <hi>Levant</hi> Company, whom he had truly ſerved; as likewiſe for his Love and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction he bore to the Nation here under his Charge, whom he would never betray, hoping ſhortly to ſee his own Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, And in two hours after, the ſaid <hi>Hetherington, Lorenzo,</hi> and Chiouz, Caddie,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:39539:39"/>and Neipe, ſealed up all the Counting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, Magazines, and ſome Chambers; and in two days after, tranſported the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners over-land up to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where they were delivered to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Power and ſafe Cuſtody; we in the mean time being left like ſo many Sheep without a Shepherd, and ignorant where to ſeek protection.</p>
                        <p>The next day after departure of theſe Priſoners, the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo</hi> ſealed up our Cloth in our own Warehouſes, for what concerned our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable part of the Leviation, at the rate of Dollars 45 <hi>per</hi> Cloth, and one third part more towards Charges.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>18th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> at the inſtance of the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> the remainder of us left here behind met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> told us we had not brought in our Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for the parts of our Leviation, and one third part more; unto which we anſwered, We had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with his Lordſhip's Commands, in all willing and obedient manner, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our preſent Poſſibilities, until we ſhould be able to ſatisfy the ſame with our ready Monies here, or by our Bills payable in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at five days ſight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we promiſed to uſe our utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, hoping to redeem our Cloth again, which we had depoſited, and they ſealed up for our proportionable Parts of the Leviation.</p>
                        <p>In few days after arrived here one of the principalleſt Chiouzes of the Grand Signior, with new Commands ſent down by his Lordſhip; by virtue whereof the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> ſeized upon the Perſons of <hi>John Ball, Henry Davey, Phillip Farwell, Nathaniel Barnardiſton,</hi> and <hi>John Ingoldsby,</hi> who were committed Priſoners to the ſaid Chiouz, who uſed them with ſome humanity, and ſent up the next day to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto his Lordſhip's Power; after whoſe departure (all Law being ſet aſide) the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo</hi> by this Command came down, opened all our Warehouſes, and by Violence carried all our Goods away into ſeveral Canes of the Truks; as well what they had ſealed up, for the Leviation, as all other Goods of what nature ſoever they could find, unleſs it were ſuch as was ſealed up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Turks, and other of the Grand Signior's Subjects; and left many of us ſo bare, that we had not wherewithal to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us a piece of Bread to keep Life and Soul together, only bare Promiſes. The ſaid Chiouz remaining behind, put us daily into great Fears that we ſhould all be ſent up, or clapt up here in Priſon, which cauſed many of us to repair on board the Ship for Succour, here being in Harbour the Ships <hi>Rainbow, Jonas, Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> and <hi>Triangle.</hi>

                        <p>In all which time of this Diſtraction and Sufferings, our Miſeries have been much condoled by the chief Turks and Inhabitants of this Place, who ſeem to ſympathize with us in our ſad Conditions; and had not the Commands been ſo powerful, the whole Town would have riſen up in our Defence and Protection, who have privately adviſed of theſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes; which as they themſelves confeſs, are like to ruin, not only this Scale, but that of <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> alſo, to the Diſhonour of the Grand Signior, and ruin of many of his Subjects; and of a profitable and acceptable Friend (our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to become a potent Enemy againſt them.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> came Letters from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> adviſing the Vizier's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for reſcuing both Factories from his Lordſhip's Impriſonment, and particular Advice to ſome of us here left, for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading the Perſons of the ſaid <hi>Hehtering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> and to keep them in ſafe Cuſtodies on board our Ships, fearing (we having no Order as yet to receive our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates out of their Poſſeſſions) they might convey our ſaid Eſtates away, or ſell them for half their Worth, and ſo make their private eſcapes out of Town, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting daily a Chiouz to carry up their Perſons to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to free our Goods, hoping all will go well again for us. Hereupon the very ſame day, the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi> and <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> (without any noiſe or rumour) were by the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners conveyed on board ſeveral Ships from the ſaid <hi>Hetherington</hi>'s Lodging, <hi>viz.

                        <p>Thus we have preſumed plainly and diſtinctly (accordingly as we conceive it becomes us) though briefly, to preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Worſhips peruſal, the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of his Lordſhip's Proceedings againſt us here in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> (ſince our laſt) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our experience of the Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; by which your Worſhips may eaſily conjecture his Lordſhip's farther Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

                  <p>But not to inſiſt long on a Subject ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as the Difference was between the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and his Merchants; the Concluſion, and Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of all was this. After Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> had ſpent at the leaſt ſeventy thouſand pieces of Eight of good ready Mony, and the Turky Company two hundred thouſand; the Turks finding the Ambaſſador's Exchequer to be almoſt exhauſted, for that Preſents and Purſes of Mony came not in ſo plentifully as at firſt; and on the contrary, feeling the Spring of the Levant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Treaſury ſtill to run freſh and quick, their Inclinations towards the Ambaſſador grew more cold and faint, his Agents were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo readily to Audience as formerly, nor his Petitions and Addreſſes received with that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, as when Mony and Intereſt made their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance eaſy; in the mean time, the Merchants were heard with great patience, their Cauſe and Complaints eſteemed reaſonable; and in ſhort, Sir <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> was diſmiſſed from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> in a manner not uſual for Ambaſſadors, nor agreeable to that Quality and Character: and was ſucceeded by Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh,</hi> who was Authorized and conſtituted in that Embaſſy, by Commiſſion from his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of ever bleſſed and glorious Memory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gio Capello</hi> being conſtituted General in the place of <hi>Molino,</hi> as we mentioned at end of the preceding Year, departed from <hi>Venice</hi> ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Spring, having under his Command fifty Gallies, ſix Galleaſſes, and forty Ships of War, and four Fire-ſhips, beſides other Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which are neceſſary Attendants on ſo great an Armata; which grand Preparations raiſed the Minds of the Chriſtian World to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the abatement of the Ottoman Pride, and other Effects equal to the magnificent Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and triumphing Glory of this mighty Power: But God, who gives not always Succeſs to the Powerful, nor the Battel to the Strong, was not, it ſeems, ſo well ſatisfied for the Sins of Chriſtendom, as to judge it worthy to be delivered from the Scourages of its Grand Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Capello</hi> remained with the beſt part of the Fleet at <hi>Candia, Tomaſo Moroſini,</hi> Admiral of the Ships, ſhewed himſelf in a Bravado with twenty two Sail before the Caſtles of the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont,</hi> called the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> defying the whole Turkiſh Power, with Colours flying, and Drums beating: nor did they dare to anſwer the bold Challenge, until in a dead Calm, ſome few light Gallies preſented themſelves in a ſeeming Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, with whom, for want of Wind, the Ships were on the diſadvantage, and rather received Prejudice than gave it; ſo that both ſides were contented with the Action.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moroſini</hi> withdrew from that Station, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his General at <hi>Candia;</hi> to whom having joined his Forces, he earneſtly perſwad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d him, together with the Proveditor <hi>Grimani,</hi> to engage the Turkiſh Fleet, which they aſſured him was much inferior to them, both in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Veſſels, and in Skill and Courage of the Combatants; and that the Succeſs of this Year conſiſted in the cutting off the Enemies Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, which was their ſole Relife and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, without which they could not longer maintain the Ground they poſſeſſed, but muſt deliver up that and themſelves to their pleaſure. But the cautious General would not aſſent to this Reſolution, judging it over-raſh and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate; for that the Fortune of <hi>Candia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> was not to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded on the Succeſs of one Battel.</p>
                  <p>During which Diſpute, and irreſolution of Affairs, the Turkeſh Fleet, conſiſting of three hundred Sail, arrived at <hi>Canea,</hi> where they landed forty thouſand fighting Men, which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Scale of the War, and rendred the Turks ſo powerful, as not ever more to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, or their Off-ſpring extirpated from the Confines of that Iſland. By this time the Pope's and <hi>Malta</hi> Gallies were come to their Aſſiſtance, and united with the Venetians; ſo that <hi>Capello</hi> ſetting ſail from the Port of <hi>Suda,</hi> reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Enemy at St. <hi>Theodoro;</hi> which was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected accordingly, though with little Succeſs, for the Turks had fortified themſelves, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their Gallies with that advantage, that they could not be aſſaulted without great hazard of the Chriſtians; and when they endeavoured to burn them, their four Fire-ſhips took fire too ſoon, and proved of more fear and aſtoniſhment to the Truks (to whom this Invention was as yet unknown) than of real dammage. After this the Venetians returned again to <hi>Suda,</hi> where having intelligence that thirty Turkiſh Gallies, with Men and Proviſion (which they had col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Archipelago</hi>) were on their Voyage to <hi>Canea, Capello</hi> preparing to intercept them with a Force of Galleaſſes and Gallies, and leaving <hi>Grimani</hi> and <hi>Moroſini</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the main Body of the Fleet, he in perſon bent his Courſe towards <hi>Cerigo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Paſha departed from <hi>Canea,</hi> in order to his return to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> with fifty ſeven light Gallies, two Ships, two Galleaſſes, and many Saiks; but meeting in his Paſſage with a hard ſtorm of Northerly Winds, he loſt ſeven of his Gallies, and ſeveral other Veſſels, ſo that he reſolved to divide his Fleet, and ſend part of them to <hi>Scio,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the other part to make for <hi>Negropont.</hi> This Fleet was followed by ſome other Veſſels under the Command of <hi>Mahomet Celebee,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Paſha of <hi>Algier,</hi> who being as far in his way as the narrow Streights of <hi>Andra,</hi> he was there ſtopped by the Fury of the Northern Winds, (which are the Maſter-Winds of thoſe Seas) and by the impetuous rage thereof, was carried to the Iſland of <hi>Zia;</hi> where having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Licence to the greateſt part of his Souldiery to Land, they careleſly ſtrayed abroad, and without ſuſpicion of Surprize, merrily paſſed their time in eating and drinking. In the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, advice hereof being carried to <hi>Tomaſo Moro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſini,</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:39539:40"/>then with ſome Ships in the Port of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> he immediately, without loſs of time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to aſſault the Turks; and being followed by the Proveditor <hi>Grimani,</hi> he took two of their Ships, whilſt <hi>Mehmet Celebee,</hi> with about two hundred of his Men, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the weak ſhelter of an old demoliſhed Fort, and afterwards ſurrendred themſelves to the diſcretion of the Conqueror.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moroſini</hi> and <hi>Grimani,</hi> encouraged with this Succeſs, reſolved to purſue the Enemies Fleet; in order unto which, <hi>Moroſini</hi> firſt putting out to Sea, was inſtantly carried away by a fierce gale of Wind towards <hi>Ambro,</hi> and ſeparated from the reſt of his Fleet, and thence again was toſſed by the impetuoſity of the Storms unto <hi>Rafti;</hi> of which <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Paſha having Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, made haſte to attack this ſingle Veſſel, with forty Gallies; giving order to the Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to lay him aboard with fifteen Gallies, the ſtrongeſt and beſt armed of all their Squadron: <hi>Moroſini</hi> nothing diſmayed, bearing the ſame conſtancy of Mind in the midſt of his Enemies, as at a diſtance, boldly ſhewed himſelf on the Quarter Deck, encouraging his Men with his words, and by his Example, to Actions wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy their Religion, Faith, and Country for which they contended. The Turks continued for ſome time to batter the Ship at a diſtance with their Cannon, but with little dammage to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; who returned their Shot to better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Hereby the Turks perceiving that Blows given ſo far off did little Execution, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Board the Veſſel, and ſubdue Her by force of Arms, and being come to the ſide of the Ship, the Souldiers were fearful to enter, ſuſpecting ſome trains of Powder to blow them up, until <hi>Emurat,</hi> one of the Captains, ſtruck off the Head of one or two of his own Men, whom he perceived backward in the Aſſault, which affrighted the reſt into the greater danger, and forced them to enter the Ship, who were ſoon followed by the Gallies of the Bey of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> of <hi>Milo,</hi> of <hi>Mehmet</hi> Bey, and others; ſo that now two hundred of the Enemy were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with Swords and Half Pikes upon the Deck;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Moroſini</hi> flair.</note> in which ſtorm, <hi>Moroſini</hi> fighting amongſt the thickeſt, was ſhot through the Head with a Musket Bullet, and ſo gloriouſly finiſhed his Days in the Service and Defence of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; gaining to himſelf a Laurel, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Name of Glory and Renown.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Souldiers little regarding all this time the fall of their General, ſtoutly maintained their Fight, in which they received encouragement from the proſpect they had of two Galleaſſes making haſte to their Succour; at whoſe nearer approach, the Turks deſiſted from their farther Attempt; being unwilling to purchaſe a Victory at the dear rate it would coſt them.</p>
                  <p>The Body of <hi>Moroſini</hi> was tranſported to <hi>Venice,</hi> and his Obſepuies Celebrated in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more Triumphant than Funebrous; the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor <hi>Grimani</hi> was likewiſe declared Captain General in the place of <hi>Capello;</hi> who having, as it were, Beſieged the Caſtles at the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> taken ſeveral places in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago,</hi> and put the Enemies Fleet often unto flight, he thereby, and by other Acts of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, rendred him juſtly renowned through all Chrſtendom.</p>
                  <p>Theſe were the chief and moſt memorable actions by Sea, performed this Year; Thoſe by Land were acted chiefly in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> where the Turks poured in their Forces on the Venetian Dominions, but were bravely repulſed by <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardo Foſcolo,</hi> who took <hi>Ali</hi> Bey Priſoner, the Commander in Chief of the Sangiac of <hi>Licca,</hi> and ſlew his Son; beſides which, he took <hi>Sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covar, Poliſſano, Iſlan,</hi> and other Fortreſſes and Caſtles, full of Arms and Ammunition, which were the Magazines of the Country; he alſo recovered <hi>Novegrade</hi> out of the hands of the Turks, which was afterwards demoliſhed by Order from the Senate; which Victories were followed with other Succeſſes; nothing being able to oppoſe the Valiant and Proſperous Arms of <hi>Foſcolo;</hi> for beſides the taking and ſacking of ſeveral other Forts and Caſtles in <hi>Dalmatia, Obraozzo, Carino, Ottiſſian, Velino, Nadino, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana, Tino,</hi> and <hi>Salona,</hi> in the Confines of <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Boſna,</hi> became a Prey to the Venetian Arms.</p>
                  <p>But to this ſucceſsful Progreſs of the War, a ſtop was given for ſome time by the ſickneſs of <hi>Foſcolo;</hi> in which interim, the new Paſha of <hi>Boſna,</hi> called <hi>Mahomet Techli,</hi> a Circaſſian born, a Perſon both Generous and Valiant, with an Army of forty thouſand Men, beſieged the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Sebenico;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sebenico</hi> beſieged.</note> but was bravely repulſed by the Valour of the Inhabitants, the very Women exceeding the imbecillity of their Sex; and Children and old Men, with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Age, ſtrengthened themſelves with Reſolution againſt their Enemies, and ſo valiantly behaved themſelves in defence of their City, that the Turk was forced to raiſe his Siege, having gained nothing but the loſs and ſlaughter of many of his People, and the beſt of his Souldiery; whereby he gained an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Invincible Strength of that place, and the Valour of the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foſcolo</hi> in like manner recovering his Health, continued the un-interrupted courſe of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and thereunto added the taking of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dona;</hi> ſo that in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> the Venetian Affairs ran ſo proſperouſly, that nothing could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to render them more happy and glorious. For the Turks not only were expelled from the Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> but likewiſe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince became more quiet and ſecure than ever it had been in the Times of Peace.</p>
                  <p>But the joy of theſe Succeſſes was very much allayed by the unhappy Fate of a great part of the Venetian Fleet, at the Iſland of <hi>Pſara;</hi> which being lanched from <hi>Candia</hi> with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſſault the Turks within the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi>

Stephano Sorich.</hi> Captain of the Morlachs, intercepted the Succours which were ſent thither, and <hi>Georgio</hi> the Proveditor, overthrew <hi>Teccbeli</hi> Paſha in a Field Battel; ſo that the Inhabitants deſparing of Relief, ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up themſelves to the mercy of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians; and thus <hi>Cliſſa</hi> being taken, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Commanded that it ſhould be more regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fortified.</p>
                  <p>And here the Chriſtian Arms met ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. For the Morlachs deſirous to caſt off the Turkiſh Yoke, and return to the protection of the Venetians, deſigned to ſurprize <hi>Scutari;</hi> and at the ſame time the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Duraz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo,</hi> with ſeven thouſand Albanians, was to ſeize upon <hi>Croia,</hi> and <hi>Aleſſio;</hi> but the Deſign being diſcovered by the traiterous practices of ſome falſe Brethren, before Matters were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely grown, or the time of Execution, it had certainly coſt the Life of all the Morlachs, and ſeven hundred Venetian Souldiers joined with them, had not the increaſe of the Waters hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſpeedy March of the Turks, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to cut them all off without mercy, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any; ſo that having time to diſperſe themſelves, and take refuge in the Mountains, the moſt of them preſerved their Lives from the Cruelty of their Enemies; only ſome certain Eccleſiaſtical Perſons falling into their Hands, they imputed unto them the cauſe of the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and in a barbarous manner impaled them on Stakes.</p>
                  <p>The Turks enraged for the loſs of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> diſpatched <hi>Dervis</hi> Paſha into the parts of <hi>Boſna,</hi> with a potent Army, threatning to Aſſault <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latro;</hi> whom to divert, <hi>Foſcolo,</hi> together with Prieſt <hi>Sorich,</hi> Captain of the Morlachs, entered into the Enemies Country; ſpoiling, burning, and deſtroying whereſoever they came. The Morlachs more greedy of Prey than ambitious of Glory, divided themſelves into ſmall Parties to rob and pillage; in which interim they were aſſaulted by the Turks, but being ſcattered, were ſo far from making a ſtout reſiſtance, that they committed themſelves to a ſhameful flight, in which great numbers of them were miſerably Butchered; nor could the valour of <hi>Sorich,</hi> nor of the Governour <hi>Poſſidaria,</hi> reduce them by their Examples into any Order: whilſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſome few valiant Dalmatians, and Morlach Captains, they endured the ſhock of all the Enemies Fury; in which Skirmiſh the Turks loſt ſeven Agas, and about ſeventy Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: On the Chriſtians ſide were killed four hundred, ſome few Slaves, and about ſeventy Enſigns taken; amongſt the reſt the good Prieſt <hi>Sorich</hi> ſcorning to turn his back, had the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune to fall into the Enemies hands, whom they flead alive, and afterwards impaled; and though they ſubdued his Body, yet he was ſtill maſter of his mind; bearing the ſame conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his Torments, as he had ſhewed Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Courage in the Face of his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe Martial Affairs were tranſacting, with the Blood and Life of many thouſands on both ſides, Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> like a ſtout Souldier of <hi>Venus,</hi> waged another War in the Elyſiums of <hi>Cupid;</hi> and caſting aſide all thoughts of <hi>Candia,</hi> remitted the ſole care and management thereof to the Vizier and Paſhas of the Divan; following a Life ſo laſcivious and ſenſual, as can neither be imagined with a chaſt Fancy, or deſcribed by a modeſt Pen.</p>
                  <p>A principal Inſtrument of his Delights, and Engine to compaſs his Amorous Deſigns, was a certain caſt Wench of his, which he named <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir Para,</hi> which ſignifies a little piece of Sugar; for it ſeems ſhe was ſo complaiſant and dulcid in her Humour and diſcourſe, as merited that apt Name to expreſs the ſweetneſs of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; this Woman having the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to viſit all the Baths in Town, took notice of every Woman which ſhe ſaw of more than ordinary Features and Proportion, and having enquired her Condition and Dwelling, preſently reported the ſame with all advantage to her Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who having heard the Beauty deſcribed, be came paſſionately Enamoured, and could find no repoſe in his Fancy, until his Inſtruments, either by fair words or violence, had ſeduced her, or forced her to his Bed. But growing now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant and over-wanton in his Amours, he fell in love with the Sultana, or Widow of his Brother Sultan <hi>Morat:</hi> To win her Affections he had recourſe to his Dear <hi>Shechir Para;</hi> who uſed all her Arts in this Service: but her pretty wheedling Terms could prevail nothing on this Lady, who anſwered her in ſhort, That at the Death of her Lord Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> ſhe had reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon a perpetual Widowhood, for that the memory of him was ſtill ſo lively in her, that ſhe could not entertain the thoughts of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any new Embraces. This repugnancy and oppoſition inflamed the heat of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> like a Feaver, ſo that he reſolved to aſſault her himſelf one day by force, and took his time juſt as ſhe came out of the Bath; but ſhe being a bold Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and diſdaining the wandring loves of <hi>Ib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahim,</hi> laid her hand upon her Dagger, (which Sultana's and great Ladies uſually wear) threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to wound him in her own defence; the noiſe and brawling hereof being over-heard by the Queen-Mother, called her from her Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and concerned her in the Quarrel; who whilſt ſhe reproved her Son, for the rape he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on his Brother's Wife, gave opportunity to the Sultana to eſcape; and ſo delivered her out of the hands of this Satyr. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> mad with love, and fuming with diſdain to be checked and oppoſed by his Mother, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her immediately to the old Seraglio, where he confined her to ſeveral days Impriſonment, during which time he underſtood in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhe had treated his large-ſiz'd Armenian, of whom we have already ſpoken; whereof the Queen-Mother being conſcious, ſubmitted her ſelf with all humility to her Son, begging his Favour and Pardon; and ſo well acted her part by thoſe who carried her Addreſſes, that ſhe over came quickly his eaſy Nature, and was again reſtored to his Grace, and her Lodgings in the new Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time <hi>Shecher Para</hi> travelling over all the Baths in Town, to diſcover new delights for her Maſter, at length had the fortune to caſt her Eyes on a Daughter of the Mufti, a Maid of Incomparable Beauty and Features of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and proportion of Body, which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſo ſenſibly, as if ſhe her ſelf had been in love; and after ſhe had praiſed every Part and Member of her, ſhe concluded in ſum, that ſhe was the moſt Excellent and admirable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39539:41"/>Piece that ever Nature framed. The Sultan had no ſooner heard the Story, but according to his uſual Cuſtom, fell moſt deſperatly in love, and had immediately, without farther conſideration or counſel, diſpatched his Emiſſaries; or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out other Preamble, Ceremony, or Courtſhip, to have fetched her to him; had not the ſenſe of the late Rebuff he had received from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Wiſe, made ſome inpreſſion of fear in him; and the apprehenſion he had of the Power of the Mufti, created in him a certain Caution and Reſpect in the treatment of his Daughter: wherefore he rather reſolved to ſend for the Mufti, with whom he treated of honourable Terms concerning Marriage; promiſing to take her into his Boſom, and prefer her in Honour equal to any other of his Sultana's.</p>
                  <p>The old Man who was tender of, and doated on his Daughter, knowing well the wandring humour of the Sultan in his Amours, intended rather to marry her to ſome great Perſonage, with whom ſhe might be more happy, than in being a Soltana: for he conſidered, that <hi>Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him</hi> having already other Sons, her Iſſue would either be Sacrificed for ſecurity of their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or elſe ſpend their days in a Priſon, and become Grey-headed, whilſt they breath in a <hi>medium</hi> between Life and Death, and are ſad Recluſes in the Grave of their unhappineſs. Theſe conſiderations were well imprinted in the mind of the Mufti: but becauſe he durſt not deny his propoſal, he dealt with him as Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours uſually do with their Lords and Superious; that is, he returned him thanks, expreſſing infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Obligations, that he would vouchſafe to caſt his Princely Eyes on the unworthineſs of his Family: however he adviſed him, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons of their Law, of which he was the Expoſitor, and obliged to be a ſevere and preciſe Obſerver; it was great Impiety in a Father to impoſe on the Affections of his Child; ſo that though he could heartily wiſh that his Daughter would embrace this Honour, to which he would exhort her with all the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Perſwaſions of a Father; yet if ſhe proved refractory thereunto, it would not be becoming his Power to force her; and therefore hoped his Majeſty would believe, that in proceeding thus far, he had performed that Duty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, both as a Father, and a Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibahim</hi> ſuppoſing that by this Conceſſion he had gained his Deſign, thanked and imbraced the old Man, whom diſmiſſing with plenary ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he remained now with an impatient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and hopes of enjoyment. Next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mufti returned early to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and having firſt ſufficiently inſtructed his Daughter to refuſe the Sultan's Proffers, told him plainly, that he had uſed all his paternal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and intereſt with his Daughter, that he might induce her to accept this mighty Fortune, which caſt it ſelf upon her; but that it found not that ready acceptance with her as he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; what could be the reaſon he knew not how to conjecture, ſince Women are commonly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, and unreaſonble in their Affections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> being in this manner diſappointed, and more angry to encounter any boundary or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint to the imperious violence of his Luſts, than oppoſition againſt the puiſſance of his Arms; diſmiſt the Mufti with ſome neglect and diſdain, whom he reſolved to treat with Rigour, and his Daughter with Courtſhip. In order to the firſt, he baniſhed him the Count, and forbad him his preſence in any other place; grew ſullen and unſatisfied at all his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Juſtice, intending thereby to induce him to a reſignation of his Office, there being nothing more irkſome to an ingenuous Spirit, than to ſerve and not to pleaſe. On the other ſide he dealt with the young Lady in a different manner, by the crafty and flattering inſinuations of his truſty <hi>Shechir Para,</hi> who ſo forcibly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged her Tongue full of curious Words, mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Threats, repreſenting the Storms and Fury of the Sultan's Rage; and again, the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Splendour, and Happineſs of the Seraglio; where ſhe ſhould Reign as Empreſs and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign of the World: all which ſhe expreſſed with that paſſion, and laſcivious enticement, as would have ſhaken a firmer Conſtancy, than the Vertue of a Turkiſh Maid: but ſhe being well admoniſhed by her Father, remained obſtinate in her Denial: but to quiet the importunity of this Seducer, ſhe begged her not to ſollicite her Father in this Requeſt, but rather that ſhe would intercede in her behalf with the Sultan ſpplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him with all humility to pardon her Childiſh refuſal, and to leave her unto her unto her own Liberty and Choice, and a ſingle Life: to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which favour from her, ſhe produced a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of conſiderable value, deſiring her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of that from her, and to become her Friend, her Aſſiſtant, and Protectreſs. <hi>Shechir Para</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by her Maiden Modeſty, could no longer reſiſt ſuch forcible Entreaties; and having her Eyes obſcured with the luſtre of the Jewel, promiſed to change her Note, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe her refual with the advantagious and compaſſionate Terms poſſible; and ſo taking her leave with a courteous farewel, repaired to the Sultan, to give an account of her Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> having with more doubtful Fear at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Iſſue of this laſt Conference, than he did the Succeſs of his War with <hi>Venice;</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his <hi>Shecher Para</hi> with exceeding joy, who being come in, began to recount all the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that had paſſed: but the ſum of all was, that this ſilly Maid was ſufficiently ſenſible of the honour of being a Soltana, of being Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Majeſty, of the Joys, Delights, and Glory of the Seraglio; but that when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, how that ſhe was to bring forth Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to die by untimely Deaths, and to end their Days by Poiſon, or the Bow-ſtring, or at leaſt to live miſerable Lives ſeparated from Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and immured within Walls, and Intombed whilſt they breathed; ſhe could not but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with ſome horrour, and judg, that all the blandiſhments of Worldly Fortune were but a tranſient Paradiſe; which could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recompence, or out-weigh the ſenſe and tenderneſs ſhe conceived for the miſery of her unfortunate Off-ſpring. Howſoever ſhe ſo cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched her Diſcourſe, that ſhe gave <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſome hopes to overcome at length; by which ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed a little his Fury and Deſpair, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome Jewels and Gifts in reward of her paſt Labour, and encouragement for her future Service. In this manner <hi>Ibrahim</hi> had patience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, expecting ſomething farther from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of <hi>Shecher Para;</hi> but finding no effect of all his expectations and gentleneſs, at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to break through all Conſiderations of Reſpect, either to the Father as the Mouth and Oracle of the Law, or to the ſimple and fooliſh innocence of the Maid; and therefore ordered the Great Vizier to cauſe a Watch to be ſet on the Girl, either going in, or coming out of the Bath, and without farther Ceremony to bring
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39539:42"/>her unto him. This Order being executed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and the Maid hurried to the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio; <hi>Ibrahim</hi> poſſeſſed and enjoyed her for ſome days, but with thoſe Tears, Reluctancy, and Sullenneſs, as tood off from the edg and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of Enjoyment; ſo that he returned her back again with ſcorn and contempt unto her Father; who at firſt diſſembled the injury with the ſame Countenance as he did before, when he was interdicted the Sultan's Preſence; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his revenge like a concealed Fire, which burſts out afterwards with more violent Flames. But though the ſenſe of Obedience and Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Prince allayed much of the choler he conceived againſt him for the Rape of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet he knew not how to pardon the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, whom he termed no other than a Ruffian or Pandor; the Miniſter of his Maſter's Luſts, and not of his Laws, and of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thus full of indignation he applyed himſelf, and made his complaint unto one <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha, a principal Member of the Divan; one of great Wiſdom and Practice in the Conduct of Affairs, and one with whom he had a particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Intimacy. Nor leſs intereſt had he with Janiſar-Aga, or General of the Janizaries; to both whom, with tears in his Eyes, and with ſuch words as the ſenſe of his injuries ſuggeſted, he railed at the Vizier, and aggravated the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment of his Daughter with all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Villany and Violence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Friends heard the Story with a ſenſible remorſe, and immediately concluded, That for the Honour and Security of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, it was neceſſary to depoſe Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> and for the ſame Reaſon to cut off the firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier; agreeing amongſt themſelves that <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> Paſha ſhould receive the Seal and the Office. To effect which, they deemed it neceſſary to draw the Qneen-Mother into the Conſpiracy, being a Woman of great Authority, and having, as it were, the Reins of Government in her Hands, by reaſon of the weak Judgment of her Son. But becauſe it was difficult to perſwade the tenderneſs of a Mother to the ruin of her Son, the wiſe Mufti reſolved firſt to ſound her Inclinations and diſpoſition towards this Deſign: and being well informed of her fierce Circaſſian Nature, and the Jealouſy and Anger ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt <hi>Shechir Para,</hi> obtained Licence to be heard by her, as if he would beg her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with her Son in his behalf; and being admitted to diſcourſe with her, he thereby plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered her moſt inveterate hatred and diſpleaſure againſt her Son; not only for this, but for many other Actions of like nature.</p>
                  <p>This diſcovery which the Queen had made, gave him the boldneſd to propoſe the confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> to his old Priſon; not that he ſhould be abſolutely laid aſide and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but only corrected awhile, and being put in remembrance of his paſt Condition, might be tanght Wiſdom, and inſtructed for the future, what moderation and juſtice Sultans are obliged to exerciſe in the Adminiſtration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo ſubtilly did he inſinuate his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that the Queen-Mother aſſented to the Propoſal, and that the Seal ſhould beconferred on <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha; for ſhe had conceived an irreconcileable hatred againſt <hi>Achmet</hi> the Grand Vizier, by whoſe Counſel ſhe was ſent to the old Seraglio, and was united in Confederacy with the deteſted <hi>Shechir Para.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Mufti greatly ſatisfied to have gained ſo conſiderable a Conſpirator to the Party, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated the whole Buſineſs, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it, to the two Kadileſchers, or Lord Chief Juſtices of <hi>Romelia</hi> and <hi>Anatolia;</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving thereof, and promiſing their utmoſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the <hi>7th.</hi> of <hi>Anguſt</hi> was the Day appointed for the Inſurrection of the Janizaries, who being all in a readineſs on that day, went in a tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary way to call the Mufti, the Kadileſchers, and other Officers and Miniſters of the Law, whom they ſeemingly forced to accompany them to the preſence of the Grand Signior, of whom they demanded, that the preſent Vizier <hi>Achmet</hi> ſhould be deprived of his Office, and that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> Paſha ſhould be conſtituted in his place. The Grand Signior at firſt refuſed their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but being perſwaded by his Mother that it was neceſſary to content the Militia in that tumult; he conſented thereunto, and having called <hi>Achment,</hi> he took from him the Seal, and conferred it on <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha, and therewith the Office of Grand Vizier. <hi>Achmet</hi> trembling at the conſequences hereof, reſolved to commit himſelf to the Mercy of the Mufti, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haſtned to his Houſe to attend his return, hoping to find him his Protector, under whoſe Shadow and Roof he fled for Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiery having thus obtained the firſt-fruits of their Inſurrection, accompanied the Mufti unto his Home, where finding the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vizier <hi>Achmet,</hi> the Janiſar-Aga immediately Commanded him out of Doors, from whence he had no ſooner drawn his Foot, than that he was ſeized upon and ſtrangled, and his Body thrown before the Gate of the new Moſch.</p>
                  <p>The next day being the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1648, the Janizaries again ariſing in the like Tumult as before, came to demand of the Mufti, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that according to their Law, Sultan <hi>ibrahim</hi> as a fool, and a Tyrant, and unfit for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ought not to be depoſed? To which the Mufti giving Anſwer in the Affirmative, ſent to cite Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> the day following to appear in the Divan, to adminiſter Juſtice to his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Subjects, who expected it from him. But <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ſuppoſing that he had ſufficiently ſatisfied the Souldiery, by putting the Vizer out of Office, laughed at the Summons which the Mufti made him; which being ſeconded by a Fetfa, which is a point of Law reſolved by the Mufti, who is the Mouth or Oracle thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Grand Signior being called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is obliged to appear before the Juſtice; the Sultan in high diſdain tore the Paper, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Head of the Mufti: but it was now too late he having already ſufficiently fortified himſelf with the Power and Strength of his Rebellious Companions. This Fetfa was immediately ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by another of a higher nature, which declared, That whoſoever obeyed not the Law of God, was not a true Muſſulman or Believer; and though that Perſon were the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet being become by his fithy Actions a Kafir or Infidel, was <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> fallen from his Throne, and no farther capable of Authority and Government. This Fetfa being ſeen by <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> he tore it in pieces, commanding the Grand Vizier inſtantly to put the Mufti to Death, as guilty of Treaſon againſt his Prince: but having now loſt his Authority, his Commands were not longer regarded, nor any reverence had of his perſon: For the Janizaries being again aſſembled about five a Clock in the Afternoon, came with their uſual tumult to the Gates of the Seraglio.</p>
                  <p>And now Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> loſing all Courage at this third attempt, fled into the Arms of his Mother, begging her Aſſiſtance and Protection.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:39539:42"/>She being a bold and ſubtle Woman, employed all her Rhetorick and Eloquence to perſwade the Souldlery not to offer Violence to the Perſon of their Lord and Maſter; promiſing that he ſhould relinquiſh the Government, and retire himſelf with a Guard into his old Lodgings. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> comforted a little, that he ſhould ſave his Life, ſhrunk himſelf willingly into his old Shell, wherein he had ſo long conſerved his Life.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Conſpirators taking forth his eldeſt Son Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> ſet him on the Throne of his Father, and planting the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouch, or Imperial Feathers on his Head, ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him for Emperor with loud Acclamations. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> continued his Impriſonment for ſome days with great patience, but at length growing deſperate and furious, often beat his Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wall, until at length, he was on the <hi>17th</hi> ſtrangled by four Mutes.</p>
                  <p>In this manner Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> ended his Days, which puts me in mind of the ſaying of a wiſer and a better King than he, <hi>That there is little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between the Priſons and the Graves of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> And this Example made a great Officer underſtand how King <hi>Charles</hi> the Glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr was put to Death. For he, I think it was the Great Vizier, falling into Diſcourſe with the Chief Engliſh Interpreter at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> not then calling to mind the Fate of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> demanded, How, and when King <hi>Charles</hi> was put to Death? Sure, ſaid he, Your King muſt have no Power, or your People muſt be more Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious and Mutinous than other Nations of the World, who durſt commit an Act ſo horrid and vile as this. See, ſaid he, How our Emperor is revered and obſerved; and how ſubmiſſive and obedient half the World is to the Nod of our Great Monarch. To which the Interpreter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that to recount unto him the Hiſtory and Occaſion of this prodigious fact, would be too long and tedious for him to hear: but that the time it happened, was ſome Months after the Death or Murder of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> which was an <hi>Item</hi> ſufficient to give him a perfect under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what he required.</p>
                  <p>Sultan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> having in this manner ended his Days, the Government was committed into the hands of the Grand Vizier, and the old Queen-Mother (which is ſhe whom we call <hi>Kio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem</hi> in the Ottoman State) and of twelve Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws; who were to manage all Affairs with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Power, during the Minority of Sultan <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who now Reigns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was the fifth Son of Sultan <hi>Achmet,</hi> born of the ſame Mother with Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> Educated like the other younger Sons of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Family; within the Walls of an obſcure and unhappy Priſon; ſo that 'tis no wonder, if wanting the advantages of ſeeing and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the World, he ſhould neither have ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Men, nor been experienced in the Art of Government. Nor leſs ſtrange is it, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to humane Infirmity; for Men who have lived under Reſtraint, Affliction, and fear of Death, to become licentious and immoderate in all kind of Pleaſures, whenſoever they paſs on a ſudden from the depth of Miſery to ſome tranſcendent degree of Happineſs and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which as, I ſay, all Men are naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto, ſo more eſpecially thoſe whoſe Religion indulges them all kind of ſenſual Carnality in this Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ibrahim</hi> was in his own Nature of a gentle and eaſy Temper, of a large Forehead, of a quick and lively Eye and ruddy Complexion, and of a good Proportion in the Features of his Face, but yet had ſomething in the Air of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that promiſed no great Abilities of Mind. And giving himſelf up to all kind of Effeminacy and Softneſs, attended not unto the Government of his Affairs; and therefore it was his greateſt misfortune to be ſerved by wicked and faithleſs Officers to whom he truſted, and to whom he gave Credence, wanting in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Talents of Wiſdom and Diſcretion to diſcern their Malice.</p>
                  <p>The continual apprehenſions that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of Death during his Impriſonment, had ſo frozen his Conſtitution with a ſtrange frigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity towards Women, that all the dalliance and warm Embraces of the moſt inflaming Ladies in the Seraglio, could not in a whole Years time thaw his Coldneſs; which was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at firſt of that Report, which ſpoke him to be impotent towards Women: during which time he attended to his Miniſters of Juſtice, and to a management of the Affairs of his Empire, which in the beginning of his Reign gained him a Credit and Reputation, and raiſed a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his goodneſs and Care of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Welfare; and evidence of which, he gave in his Charge to the Great Vizier, that he ſhould put no Man to Death unleſs for Capital and Enormous Crimes. But at length loſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Luſts and Senſualities, he forſook the Helm of his Regency, committing the guidance of his Empire to other Hands: and as he was ignorant of War, ſo he fooliſhly ſported in the Calms of peace; and ſuffering himſelf to be guided only by Fortune, felt the Stroke thereof in his laſt Unhappy Fate.</p>

                     <p>SUltan <hi>Ibrahim</hi> periſhing in this manner, by the mutinous Violence of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, his Son <hi>Mehmet,</hi> or <hi>Mahomet,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Child of ſeven Years of Age, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Throne: During whoſe Minori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (which was to continue for the ſpace of ten Years longer) his Mother, who was the firſt <hi>Sultana,</hi> aſſiſted with the Counſel of twelve Paſhaws, took upon her ſelf the Regency, and in the firſt place reſolved to continue the War againſt the Venetians, which <hi>Ibrahim</hi> intended to conclude, having engaged himſelf far in a Treaty of Peace with the Bailo or Ambaſſador, which reſided at the Port for that Republick.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe Matters were tranſacting, and Preparations making to proſecute the War; the Malignant Humours of the Empire began to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto that degree, as affected the Body Politick at firſt with unnatural Heats, which ſoon afterwards proceeded to a Feaver, and then to a dangerous Convulſion. The ill-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Part was the Militia, which is the Heart and Principal of the Life of that Government. For the Spahees and the Janiſaries, being the Horſe and Foot, entred into a deſperater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie.</p>
                     <p>The firſt judged it their Duty to revenge the Death of their Soveraign, Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> and in order thereunto demanded the Head of the Great Vizier, as the Chief Author and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver of the Death of his Lord and Maſter. The others being conſcious to themſelves of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, by their Arms, carried on the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not only declared their Reſolutions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Vizier, but owned that what he had acted was by their Order, and at their Requeſt and Inſtigation.</p>
                     <p>The Spahees being highly provoked with this Declaration, ſwelled with Anger and Malice againſt the Janiſaries; and both ſides being equally proud and rich, could not bear each others Reproaches. The Spahees being Men of Eſtates in Land, looked on themſelves as the Gentry, and to have the greateſt Share in the concernment of the Empire. The Janiſaries living regularly in their Chambers, or Martial Colledges, looked on themſelves as the better Souldiers, and the more formidable Party; and the truth is, both of them were proceeded to that height of Command and Authority in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that had they not been ſuppreſſed by the cruel Hand, and bloody Diſpoſition of <hi>Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlee,</hi> as ſhall be more largely related hereafter, this Empire was then in danger of falling into as many Diviſions, as there were at that time Paſhaws, or great Captains. The cauſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39539:44"/>proceeded from the warlike diſpoſition of Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> who being the moſt Martial Man of his Age, preferred none but Men of great Courage, and ſuch as had ſignalized their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour by undoubted proofs; And ſuch Men as theſe he loaded with Honour, and raiſed them to the higheſt and moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>minent Charges in the Government.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Morat</hi> dying ſoon afterwards, theſe Great Men had time to enrich themſelves during the gentle and eaſie Reign of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> which being ſeconded by the Minority of this Young Sultan, their Pride knew no bounds, either of Modeſty towards their Commanders, or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards their Sultan. Hence it was that the Souldiery dividing, ſo great a Sedition aroſe amongſt them, that at laſt they came to Blows, reſolving to decide the Controverſy by the Sword. But the Quarrels of Turks amongſt themſelves not being Commonly of long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, the Care and Vigilance of the Magiſtrates prevented all open defiance in the Field; but yet could not ſo paciſie their Animoſities, but that ſeveral Skirmiſhes, or Rencounters, paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in the Streets, wherein the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees were always worſted, and at length were forced to abandon the City, ſcarce daring for ſome time to own the Name of Spahee within the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Diſturbances gave the Venetians ſome hopes to accommodate their Peace with better Advantage; but the Reply to this Propoſition was more fierce and poſitive than ever, and ſo ill reſented that the Bailo going from his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> ſeized on, and with all his Retinue. clapped into Priſon and Chains; being ſent to thoſe Caſtles which are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ituate on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> in the middle way between <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and the Black Sea. But this furious ſeverity, by the interceſſion of other Chriſtian Miniſters, continued not long, before the Bailo received more gentle Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Sacrifice which the Turks made unto themſelves of <hi>Grillo,</hi> his Interpeter, who being called down from the preſence of the Bailo, was immediately, by two Officers, ſtrangled, and his Body thrown out at the Window of the Caſtle; the which act, though it may ſeem unjuſt and barbarous to us, hath yet been frequently practiſed amongſt the Turks, being to this day their common uſe to threaten the Druggermen, or Interpreters; which is the cauſe that they often mince, or wholly alter the ſenſe or meaning of their Maſters, on thoſe Occaſions, when words are ſpoken by them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to the Turks.</p>
                     <p>The Turks bearing this Diſdain to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, laboured to re-enforce their Armies in <hi>Candia,</hi> and ſupply them with Ammunition and Proviſions; and thought the Venetians lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles</hi> to intercept all Succours which might be carried thither; yet the Turks, notwithſtanding their Diviſions, having recruited their Fleet with forty Gallies, and ten Great Ship, broke through the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and in deſpight of them, convoyed five Gallies laden with Souldiers and Ammunition, and landed them ſafe at <hi>Canea;</hi> and about the ſame time ſix Gallies, and ten Ships of <hi>Barbary,</hi> entered into the Port of <hi>Suda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The General which commanded in Chief was named <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, a Perſon of great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Experience; he had for ſome time beſieged the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> but for want of Men and Ammunition was forced to riſe from that Place, and retire to <hi>Canea</hi> and <hi>Retimo,</hi> whilſt in the mean time the <hi>Candiots</hi> received re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of Men, and ſupply of Proviſions, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their leiſure-time to fortifie their Town with ſuch Works as rendred it almoſt impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and made it become the Wonder and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the World after ſome Years ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the War only carried on in <hi>Candia,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Dalmatia, Morea, Boſna,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania.</hi> For <hi>Foſcolo,</hi> the General of <hi>Venice,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to force ſome Corn from the Parts of <hi>Caſtel-nuovo,</hi> he landed ſome Men there, but was ſo ill received by the Turks, that he was forced to retreat unto his Veſſels with great diſorder, and no leſs diſhonour. But he had better fortune in the Parts of <hi>Boſna,</hi> where he repulſed the Enemy to the very Gates of <hi>Sarſay,</hi> the Capital City of that Province, and took upon compoſition the Fortreſs of <hi>Riſano,</hi> which is ſcituate between <hi>Cataro</hi> and <hi>Caſtel-nuovo;</hi> but at length the Turks receiving an additional Aid of ſifteen or ſixteen thouſand Men, the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were forced to quit their new Conqueſts, and retire into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>During the time that theſe Affairs were in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the young Emperor was proclaimed, and his Inauguration celebrated with the uſual Ceremonies, but with Rejoicings, and hopes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; who being yet ſcarcely arrived to eight years of Age, many Mutinies and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles aroſe in divers Parts of the Empire, as in <hi>Damaſcus, Syria, Anatolia,</hi> and other Countries, where the Paſhaws refuſed to pay in the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Taxes and Tribute, declaring, That they would keep the Mony in their Hands during the Minority of the Grand Signior; and that when he came to Age of Government, they would be accountable to him both for the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal and for the Improvement.</p>
                     <p>The Turks in <hi>Hungary</hi> making incurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Territories of the Emperor, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by the Count <hi>Forgatz,</hi> near <hi>Buda,</hi> where the Paſha was taken Priſoner, and his Son ſlain.</p>
                     <p>Nor better fortune had they in the Aſſault they made on the Fortreſs of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt five thouſand Men, they were forced to retire with great diſhonour.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> alſo in this Conjuncture grew more bold, ſo that they covered the Black Sea with their Boats, doing great damage to the Saicks, and other Veſſels, which traded in that Sea; and at length came up the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> above <hi>Therapea,</hi> giving a great Alarm, with much Fear and Confuſion to all <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amidſt theſe Misfortunes, and inteſtine Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, new Diſorders, aroſe in the Ottoman-Empire; For, as commonly, all the blame of miſcarriages and ill ſucceſſes in <hi>Turkie</hi> are caſt upon the Head of the Commander in chief; ſo the Enemies of the Great Vizier took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in this conjuncture to reproach his ill Government, and carried the accuſation ſo far, as to depoſe him from his Charge and Office; in whoſe place the Aga, or General of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries, ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>The Spahees in <hi>Aſia,</hi> being diſpleaſed with this Election, aſſembled in a Body of ſeven or eight thouſand, and marched towards <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> pretending to revenge the Death of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim;</hi> their Numbers daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, the Divan very much feared leſt the Party which favoured the Spahees in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſhould join themſelves to the Aſian Mutineers; to prevent which it was judged good Reaſon and Policy, to anticipate the Juſtice they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:39539:44"/>by taking away the Life of the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Vizier; which being eaſily aſſented unto, and without much heſitation performed, gave ſome little ſtop to the Fury and Heats of the Spahees.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, as the Diviſions which the Turks entertain amongſt themſelves, were never ſo great as to afford the Chriſtians any Advantage thereby, ſo the Venetians did not reap any Benefit from theſe Quarrels; but on the contrary, the Turks ſtudiouſly attended to their Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> paſſing thither with ſixty Gallies, thirty great Ships, and twenty five other ſmaller Veſſels, laden with Men, and all ſorts of Proviſions and Ammunition for War; ſo that in this Year 1649, the Affairs of the Turks remained in that Iſland in this happy and hopeful poſture. Amongſt theſe Ships were thirteen Engliſh, which the Turks took up at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and forced into their Service. For though the Ambaſſador, Sir <hi>Thomds Bendysh,</hi> then Reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> oppoſed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of theſe Ships what was poſſible, and alſo the Commanders and Seamen were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and diſſatisfied to undertake the Deſign, yet the Turks with Menaces, and Promiſes of Reward, forced them to carry Men and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to <hi>Candia;</hi> ſo that, making a Virtue of Neceſſity, they complied with that which they could not reſiſt.</p>

                        <hi>CHuſaein</hi> Paſha, Governour of the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> having received theſe Succours and Recruits, reſolved to beſiege the Chief City of <hi>Candia;</hi> to which intent, drawing out from the Ships, and Gariſons of <hi>Retimo</hi> and <hi>Canea,</hi> what Men he was able, he formed an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of thirty thouſand Men, with which he marched, and pitched before the Town. He was provided alſo with twelve Pieces of Cannon, four thouſand Sacks of Wooll, three thouſand Ladders, and with a good quantity of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does; with this Force he attaqued the City in two places, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Forts of <hi>Martinengo,</hi> and <hi>Mocenigo;</hi> and preſſed ſo hard on the latter, that notwithſtanding the generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Defendants, he won the Fort, and there planted the Ottoman Colours; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying it with more Cannon, and a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men.</p>
                     <p>Count <hi>Coloredo,</hi> Governour of that Place, was then ſick, the Gariſon very weak, and things reduced to the laſt terms of extremity; when General <hi>Balbiani,</hi> Admiral of <hi>Malta,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with ſix Gallies, and there landed ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men, and ſixty Kingts; which with great Courage mounted the Guard of the Fort <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinengo,</hi> which was the place of moſt Danger and Honour. The Turks excited with a deſire to welcome the new Gueſts, made three deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and furious Aſſaults on this Fort, but were with equal Valour repulſed by the Defendants; at which Diſgrace and Foil being highly enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they reſolved on a fourth Attempt, which they purſued with that Courage and Succeſs, that the Venetians were forced to give way to their Violence, with the ſlaughter almoſt of all thoſe which defended this Fort; until the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers of <hi>Malta,</hi> who having no greater Glory, nor readier Will, that to ſpill their Blood for the Chriſtian Cauſe, rallied all the Force they were able, and made ſo proſperous an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque upon the Fort, that they recovered it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with the Blood and Deſtruction of all thoſe who defended it; but they enjoyed it not long, before the Turks regained it with the like ſucceſs and ſlaughter: which variety of Fortune the Venetians being ſenſible of, and that they could not bear ſuch coſtly Interchanges with the Turks, had recourſe to their ultimate Remedy of Mines, which ſucceeded ſo happily, that the whole Fort was carried into the Air, and therewith two thouſand good Souldiers of the Turks; with which Deſtruction, and other Repulſes in divers places, they were ſo weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſcouraged, that they raiſed the Siege on the fifth of <hi>October</hi> new Stile.</p>
                     <p>In this Interim, the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> called the <hi>Krim,</hi> demanded the Guardianſhip of the young Sultan, as of right belonging unto him; but the Council anſwered hereunto, That their Maſter was already in better Hands than thoſe into which they deſired to transfer him; and that his Grandmother, and the Divan, wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wiſdom nor Fidelity to direct his Affairs: with which anſwer the Tartar being forced to remain ſatisfied, was able to revenge himſelf no farther, than by exciting the Coſſacks to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Seas; which gave ſome diverſion to thoſe Arms, which otherwiſe had all been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt the Venetians.</p>
                     <p>But theſe Deſigns from <hi>Tartary</hi> did little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Council, in compariſon of that Spirit of Diſcord which was ariſen between the Spahees and the Janiſaries; for both Parties being emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of each others Greatneſs, endeavured on all Occaſions to elevate their Chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the higheſt and moſt profitable Places of the Epire: which Diſſention touching the principal Miniſters of State, who were all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on the one ſide or the other, adminiſtred great Troubles, and retarded the execution and ſucceſs of all the grand Deſigns of the Empire. Nor was it of leſs importance and diſhonour to the Divan, that their Fleet was hindred paſſage by the Venetians, who blocked up the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles;</hi> whereby all intercourſe with <hi>Candia</hi> was interrupted: but being reſolved to remove this Obſtacle, they commanded the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Paſha to force his Paſſage; which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly performing, was ſo warmly received, that he quickly loſt two Gallies, and after much Blood, and loſs on both ſides, was forced at length to retire again within the Streights. But what was of worſe conſequence to the Turks, was the inveterate Diſcord between the Spahees, and Janiſaries; who having been unadviſedly embarked promiſcuouſly together, came often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Words, and then to Blows; which ended not without the Bolld and Death of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of each party. Theſe miſchiefs increaſed the rage which the Turks at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt the Venetians; who were all thereupon (not excepting the Bailo <hi>Soranzo,</hi> nor his Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi>) interdicted the Territories of the Grand Signior; and ſent back into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Captain-Paſha, that he might be in a capacity to make a ſecond Attempt to force his paſſage, ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for new Recruits: when News came that the Siege of <hi>Candia</hi> was raiſed, and that the Turks had loſt the Fort of St. <hi>Theodoro;</hi> which ſo angred the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Queen-mother againſt the Vizier, that ſhe immediately depoſed him from his Charge, and therewith had taken away his Life, had not hte Faction of the Janiſaries protected him in this Extremity.</p>
                     <p>The Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> was introduced into his place, a Perſon of a turbulent and ambitious
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:39539:45"/>Spirit, who to increaſe his Favour with his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs the Sultana, evidenced his Heat and Zeal againſt the Venetians, and to that end ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately expreſs Orders to the Paſha of <hi>Boſna,</hi> to inveſt <hi>Cliſſa</hi> with all the Power he was able; and therewith he preſented him with a Cimeter, and a Halter; the former to be his Reward in caſe of good Succeſs, and the latter to be his Puniſhment in caſe of Misfortune. But this furious Vizier continued not ſo long, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience the Iſſue of this Command; for he was in a few days laid aſide, and <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, the General of <hi>Candia,</hi> was placed in his ſtead; howſoever his Orders were to remain with the Army, by which means, much Emulation and Conteſt was prevented, which might otherwiſe have happened between the Spahees, and Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, at the Election of a new Vizier; and thereby all excuſes taken from the Souldiery of abſence from the War, who could now pretend nothing of Reaſon to withdraw themſelves, on ſcore of attendance on the Vizier's Perſon; and to ſupply his Authority at the Regal Court, a Chimacam was ſubſtituted to adminiſter Juſtice in place of the Vizier, which is uſual on ſuch Occaſions.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, Affairs ſucceeded not extraordinary well for the Turks in <hi>Candia;</hi> for being ſtraitned for Proviſions in <hi>Canea,</hi> by the near approach of the Chriſtians, the Turks were forced to make a Diverſion, by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great Troops before <hi>Candia;</hi> which they were enabled to do, by the Supplies they had lately received, with the arrival of their Fleet of Gallies; for the Winter Seaſon approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Venetians were conſtrained to abandon their ſtation before the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> and to leave the Paſſage open for the Enemy.

                     <p>So that now it was no time to talk to the Souldiers or People of a War in <hi>Candia;</hi> For the firſt thought themſelves engaged to contrive a Settlement and Determination of Diſputes at Home: and the latter being irritated with a new Tax laid on them, for want of Mony in the Treaſury, exclaimed, and talked loud, and at length, inſtead of paying, broke out into open Rebellion; which by aſſiſtance of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, was appeaſed, under no leſs Terms than the Death of ſeveral principal Miniſters of State.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Diviſions, the Venetians had time to arm out a very conſiderable Fleet for defence of <hi>Candia; Foſcolo,</hi> who had been Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> being ſent thither with title of <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> in the place of <hi>Mocenigo:</hi> But theſe Diſſentions amongſt the Turks, according to their uſual Cuſtom, laſting not long before they came to a Concluſion, by the entire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of one of the Parties; the Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters began to reaſſume again the thoughts of proſecuting the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> and to ſend Recruits to reinforce the Army under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, who was returned with new Forces and Courage to aſſault the City of <hi>Candia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time a certain Greek, pretending to be a Perſon of Quality, and diſcontented with the Turks, fled from them to the Chriſtians, where being received with all kind and obliging entertainment, he had thereby liberty of ſeeing and viſiting all the Fortifications of the Place. After he had obſerved and diſcovered as much as he deſired, this traiterous Fugitive fled again to the Turkiſh Camp, where he revealed what places were moſt ſtrong or beſt fortified, and where the Town was weakeſt, and moſt eaſily to be aſſaulted. The Venetian General being awakened at this Diſcovery, and conſidering the numbers of his People to be few, in reſpect of the Enemy, and that the Outworks could not be maintained without a more numerous Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he reſolved to deſtroy ſome of thoſe Forts; and accordingly blew up with Mines four Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which being at a diſtance could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved without much danger. The Turks here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by making conjectures of the weakneſs of the beſieged, cheerfully aſſaulted the Fort of St. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrio,</hi> thinking to carry it without much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but contrary to their expectation, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred ſo bold a reſiſtance, that they loſt three thouſand Men on the Place.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> they were ſtill ſo intent to carry on this War, that having prepared, and laden on the Fleet great quantities of Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, Bomboes, and Mortar-pieces, with other Fire-works, the Captain-Paſha, with hopes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his Force, ſet forth to Sea, with eleven hundred Sail, conſiſting of Gallies, Ships, Galleaſſes, Saiques, Brigantines, and ſmaller Veſſels, with reſolution to engage the Venetian Fleet, whoſe Commanders alſo were equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and ready to conſent with them to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Venetians being at an Anchor in the Port of St. <hi>Ermina,</hi> diſcovered the Turkiſh Fleet, to which, as they were much inferiour in number, ſo they were ſuperiour to them in the agreement and experience of their Commanders. The Turks having paſſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on their way, the Venetians purſued them, and the better to draw them to a Battel, <hi>Moce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigo</hi> ordered two Ships, commanded by <hi>Barbaro</hi> and <hi>Dolphino</hi> to croſs the Turks at the point of the Iſland; and his Vice-Admiral, <hi>Bataggio,</hi> with four Ships to engage the main Body of the the Turkiſh Fleet; to whoſe aſſiſtance many other Veſſels coming in, he ſo rudely treated ſeveral Gallies, that they were forced to ſeek harbour in the Port of <hi>Chios,</hi> now <hi>Scio,</hi> with the loſs of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Paſha of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> who was ſent to ſucceed in the Office of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, the General of <hi>Candia;</hi> but Night coming on, the reſt of the Fleet retreated to the Iſles of <hi>Naxia</hi> and <hi>Paros.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the tenth day the Turks having watered their Fleet, gave a ſignal of defiance to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, by diſcharge of two pieces of Cannon; and the Venetians accepting the Challenge, both Fleets gave a furious charge one to the other; but the Turks were not able to withſtand the Courage and Skilfulneſs of the Venetians; for the Captain-Paſha having loſt many of his Men, and the Poop of his Gally being carried
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:39539:45"/>away with a Cannon-ſhot, the whole Fleet was put into Diſorder, and then unto flight, ſo that the Gallies began to employ themſelves in toaing the Ships. But one of their Mahones being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the reſt, was aſſaulted by two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſſes, and ſome Ships, and finding none to come in for Succour, the Captain was killed, with four hundred Souldiers, and two hundred were taken Priſoners.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> the General, gave chaſe to the Gallies, which two to a Ship were toaing the heavier Veſſels as faſt as they could; but being hardly purſued, were forced to caſt off the Hauſer, and ſhift for themſelves as well as they were able.<note place="margin">A great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans over the Turks.</note> The Turkiſh Ships ſeeing themſelves thus abandoned, fired whole Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides upon the Enemy; but the Venetian Gallies leaving their own Ships aſtern, that they might purſue their advantage, <hi>Querini</hi> boarded a Great Galleaſs, called the <hi>Soltana,</hi> upon which were three hundred Souldiers, who offered to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon promiſe of Quarter for their Lives. But the Chriſtian Souldiers heated with fight, and not then underſtanding any thing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, deſperately boarded the Veſſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Turks being reduced to an extremity of deſpair, gave fire to the Powder, and therewith carried, as well the Vanquiſhers, as the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, into the other World.</p>
                     <p>According to this example four other Veſſels burnt themſelves, one of 60 braſs Guns, and three others of 40 to 44. Fifteen Veſſels of the Starboard Wing ſaved themſelves by good ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Of the Larboard Wing, Captain <hi>Nicolo,</hi> a Renegado, with his Ship, was taken by the Admiral of the Galleaſſes, likewiſe another Great Veſſel by <hi>Lazaro Mocenigo,</hi> and another by Proveditor <hi>Melino.</hi> In ſhort, there was not one Veſſel which remained in ſight of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, which was not either taken, ſunk, or burnt. Notwithſtanding all which, conſidering the Veſſels which were eſcaped, and the 3 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men which the Turks had landed at <hi>Naxia,</hi> in order to their being tranſported unto <hi>Candia,</hi> the Victory ſeemed to be very imperfect; wherefore the Venetians attending another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the Turkiſh Fleet, did happily meet them in a few days after; and being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with the late Succeſs, as the Enemy was low in their Spirits and Reſolution, they bravely attaqued the Turks, and took 39 Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, 23 Ships, three Galleaſſes, together with the three thouſand Souldiers which were then embarked from <hi>Naxia:</hi> Thoſe which eſcaped took Refuge in the Port of <hi>Rhodes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After this great loſs, the Turks entertained no great Deſigns of the Conqueſt of <hi>Candia;</hi> but only to conſerve <hi>Canea,</hi> and the footing that they had won in that Iſland: nor did ever the Turks after this, dare to ſtand a formal Battel with the Venetians at Sea, but rather contriving to eſcape than to fight, did ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter build light Gallies, for tranſporting of Men and Ammunition, with intention to wage their War only at Land, and not at Sea; it being a ſaying ever after common in their Mouths; <hi>That God had given the Sea to Chriſtians, and the Earth to the Turks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To theſe ill Succeſſes abroad, were added great Diſſentions at Home; for the mutinous Spahees in <hi>Aſia,</hi> having united into a ſtrong Body, marched towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to join with their other Brethren in thoſe Parts. The Janiſaries on the other ſide, not leſs diligent to oppoſe their Enemy, to revenge the Outrages committed on their Brethren, whom the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees had ill-treated, having cut off the Noſes and Ears of ſeveral of them; beſides all which, they proceeded to that height of Inſolence, as to demand the Heads of the Great Vizier, and of the Aga of the Janiſaries; and being now by their numbers rendered formidable to the Court, it was judged agreeable to the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture, to ſatisfy in ſome meaſure theſe Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, by diſcharging theſe two Officers of their employment, which did in ſome degree for the preſent quallfy and appeaſe theſe Tumults.</p>

                     <p>BUT theſe Troubles being with time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, the Grand Vizier deſired greatly the Conqueſt of <hi>Candia,</hi> which being by experience proved to be with difficulty guined by the Sword, he endeavoured to win it by fairer Terms; and to that end wrote a Letter to the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> in Letters of Gold; wherein he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it ſeemed ſtrange to him, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate had not diſpatched their Ambaſſador to him with the ſurrender of <hi>Candia,</hi> in regard that thereby they might aſſure themſelves to purchaſe a certain Peace, which they vainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded by ſuch delays. Howſoever in theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters no mention was made of the Cauſes, or Reaſons, why Signior <hi>Capello,</hi> who was an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Perſon, being Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and ſent thither for Bailo, was ſo ill treated with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment at his Arrival, notwithſtanding the permiſſion and encouragement which was given for his kind reception, obtained at the inſtance of the French Ambaſſador; but this Reſtraint continued not long upon him, before he was releaſed with a daily Allowance (which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for ſome time) of 1200 Aſpers a Day; and afterwards the Court returning from <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he was permitted to lodg in the Palace which belongs to the Bailo's of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Venetian Fleet being Victorious at Sea, made it their work to keep the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles</hi> always blocked up, whereby they hindered all Succours from <hi>Candia:</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which diligence, the Venetians being ſometimes forced, for the ſake of Water and Proviſion, to abandon that Station; the Turks took hold of the opportunity to eſcape forth; but being eagerly purſued by the Venetians, they were forced to take Sanctuary in <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where being again blocked up, the affairs in <hi>Candia</hi> ſuffered much, and the Complaints from thence were loud at the Court. So that Orders were ſent, and often repeated unto the Captain-Paſha, that he ſhould ſpend no longer time in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:39539:46"/>
                        <hi>Rhodes,</hi> but that in deſpight of all Difficulties, he ſhould immediately proceed to <hi>Candia,</hi> and fight through the Venetians in caſe they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way to interrupt his paſſage; but the Captain-Paſha notwithſtanding theſe Orders, and Menaces which accompanied them, could not perſwade himſelf to the Hazard of a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; till at length, the ſeaſon of the Year ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and being wearied in the Port of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> he reſolved to adventure abroad; but inſtead of going to <hi>Candia,</hi> he plundered the Iſlands as he paſſed, and returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with 40 Gallies, where he hoped with the Booty he had plundered to appeaſe the anger of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van againſt him: but this Sacrifice did not much avail, for he was not ſooner arrived, than his Perſon was ſeized, and Goods ſealed up for the uſe of the Grand Signior; the which Seal his Sons broke open, and taking with them the richeſt and moſt conſiderable part of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eſtate, laded it on one of the Gallies, and fled therewith into Foreign Parts, little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding that danger in which they had left their Father to periſh. During which time the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netions ſtill maintained their Guards on the Coaſts of <hi>Candia,</hi> not ſuffering any Recruits of Men, or Proviſions for War, to be tranſported thither; ſo that if the Turks deſigned to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute this War, it muſt be by new Forces, and ſuch as were able to encounter the Marine Power of the Enemy; the which being reſolved upon by the Council, a heavy Tax was laid on the people to carry on the Deſign, which they not willingly ſupporting, made a publick Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in the City; and at the ſame time alſo the ancient Quarrel between the Spahees and Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, began again to ferment; which Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles being added to a Rebellion raiſed by the Paſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who increaſing in ſtrength and number, came marching towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> put that great City into a horrible Fear and Confuſion.</p>

                     <p>THE Venetians judged that theſe Troubles would naturally produce ſome Advantage to them, and much facilitate the Peace which they had long deſired: but as Seditions amongſt the Turks are always too violent to continue; ſo theſe Diſcontents evaporated in a ſhort time, and new Reſolutions were taken to proſecute the War in <hi>Candia;</hi> for notwithſtanding that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de Ventelay,</hi> Son to the French Ambaſſador, mediated with agreeable prudence to compoſe Matters in order to a Peace, yet his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were all inſignificant; for neither had Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Capello</hi> Audience granted him, nor that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which was promiſed before his Arrival; the Turks ſtill inſiſting on the Surrender of <hi>Candia,</hi> would not underſtand any Terms which did not entirely inveſt them in that Conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>To effect which by Force, which could not be performed by Compoſition; the Paſha of <hi>Buda</hi> was Elected for Captain-Paſha, or Commander in Chief of the Seas; and Orders given to equippe a new Fleet of Ships, and Gallies, for tranſporting the Succours of Men and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to <hi>Candia:</hi> where <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, being wearied with his long Siege of the Town, withdrew his Men at ſome farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for their better refreſhment; for they wanting all Conveniencies in their Trenches, began to Mutiny, and to refuſe the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their Duty, until the General ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Pay, and diſpenſing liberally Largeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to the Officers, gave them new Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Satisfaction; with which, being a little enlivened, <hi>Chuſaein</hi> ſent a Herald, with a defiance to thoſe in the City, challenging them to fight a pitcht Battel with him: but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians refuſed the Offer, thinking it more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence not to accept, than loſs of Honour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an Anſwer to the Challenge. Then the Turks ſought ſome means to effect their Deſign by Treachery; to which end, they treated with a certain Captain for delivery of one of the Gates of the City; which he promiſed to do unto the Turks, but gave Advertiſement unto the Governour. The Paſha the night following advanced with ſome Troops, hoping to find one of the Gates opened to him; but inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Defendants having prepared a Mine to receive them, ſprang the ſame ſo opportunely, that it carried away the moſt of thoſe who were engaged in the Deſign, and therewith their hopes of becoming Maſters ſpeedily of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortreſs. Wherefore they reſolved for a while to repoſe, and attend thoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours which were now preparing at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Fleet being put into a readineſs, the Souldiery departed with their uſual hopes of Succeſs; but meeting with their Enemy again at the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> the Fight was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and hot for a long time between them, but concluded to the diſadvantage of the Turks, who there loſt 6000 Men, two Gallies, three Ships, and a Mahone: howſoever they broke through the Venetians, and landed 12000 Men in the Iſle of <hi>Candia.</hi> The News of this defeat, and the Confirmation thereof, by the wounded Men which were landed at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made a great noiſe amongſt the people. Howſoever the Turks perſiſting conſtant to their Intentions of proſecuting the War, ſent Orders to the Captain-Paſha again to fight the Venetians ſo ſoon as the Fleet was refitted, and reſtored to a condition to engage in another Battel; but the Venetians ſcarce gave them the leiſure to repair, before they attacked them again, whereby they put them to ſuch diſorder, that they were forced to take refuge in the firſt convenient Port; where having attended a favourable Wind, they haſtned to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and from thence were diſpatched into the Black Sea againſt the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, who very much infeſted thoſe parts.</p>
                     <p>The Captain-Paſha being arrived, extolled his own great Services and Adventures, and on the contrary vilified the Great Vizier, diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all his Actions, as mixed with weak Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and proſecuted with Cowardiſe, or want of true Reſolution: the which took ſuch deep impreſſion in his abſence, having none to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for him; that all being given for granted which was alledged againſt him, Orders were diſpatched to <hi>Candia</hi> by an Officer to take off his Head, in whoſe place this Captain-Paſha ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt of all theſe Combuſtions of War, the mediation of Peace was carried on by the French Ambaſſador: For though Signior <hi>Capello</hi> was actually Reſident on the Place, qualified with the Character of Bailo for the Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> yet the Turks would ſcarce vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to Treat perſonally with him; and indeed his ſufferings by Impriſonment, and other bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Uſages, had affected him with ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, as rendred him uncapable for ſome time of adminiſtring publick Affairs; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt his Reaſon, by giving way to ſad and black Thoughts, he laid violent Hands on

                     <p>THE Great Vizier after all his evil Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, fell very ſick and infirm; ſo that the Court conſidering him as a Perſon uncapable of farther Service, caſt their eyes on the Paſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who being a daring Martial Man, was eſteemed to be the better Chief in ſuch a hazardous War, which for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sea, was unuſual and diſpleaſing to the Turks. Againſt him nothing could be objected beſides his Rebellions and Contrariety to the Government; but hereunto it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwered, that the extravagance of his humour proceeded only from his Ambition of being Great Vizier; which when he had attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that thirſty deſire of Glory, which he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd for acquiring this Office, would be buſied in thoughts to advance and improve his Honour in Actions beyond his Predeceſſors.</p>
                     <p>Letters being arrived at this Paſha's hands, which called him to Court to accept this Charge, did ſecretly pleaſe the humour of his haughty Spirit; howſoever, he remained for a while in ſome ſuſpence and irreſolution, not being aſſured whether ſome Deceit might not be concealed under this ſpecious appearance of Preferment: But conſidering, that the way unto Gains and Advantage was by daring Adventures, he reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely accepted the Proffer, and put himſelf in his March towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Equipage of forty thouſand Men, thinking therewith to make good his Retreat, and ſecure his Perſon in caſe that Deceit were diſcovered which he rationally ſuſpected. Being arrived near unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he received from the Great Signior ſeveral Meſſages of Kindneſs, and a good welcome; and was accordingly received into the City, and inveſted in the Office, with all the Circumſtances of Favour and Honour imaginable.</p>
                     <p>Having thus taken poſſeſſion of his Charge, he promiſed the Grand Signior that he would employ all his Endeavours to reſtore the decayed Eſtate of Affairs, and reform the Government. And as an earneſt thereof, he began to remove ſuch Miniſters from the Court which were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by him; and to render himſelf the more Abſolute, he cut off ſeveral others, whom he imagined might in any wiſe diſturb or controul him in the management of his Affairs.</p>
                     <p>After which he diſpatched his Orders to all Maritime Towns of the Empire, to fit and make ready what Gallies and Ships were poſſible to be provided, intending thereby to ſet out the greateſt Fleet that ever was ſeen in the <hi>Levant:</hi> but to compleat this Work, two great Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties aroſe; The firſt was, to find a wiſe and well experienced Commander: and the next, was in what manner to perſwade the Spahees and Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries to embark; for they having heard and ſeen in what manner their Companions had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in this miſerable War, abſolutely refuſed to go; and though the Animoſities of theſe two orders of Souldiers were irreconcileable one to the other, yet in this common Cauſe being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they raiſed ſo horrible a Sedition, that they aſſaulted the Mufti in his very Houſe, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him within the Gates of the Seraglio with a thouſand reproaches and injuries, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of evil Counſels, and a Diſturber of the common Peace and Quiet of the Empire. Nor was it poſſible to appeaſe this Tumult, but by anticipating to them four months Pay; with which their Minds being made more pliable, they gently yielded to Obedience, and ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be embarked for <hi>Candia.</hi>

After having remained three days at the mouth of the <hi>Dardanelles</hi> near the Caſtles, they went out in this Order; The Bey's Gallies were the firſt, then followed the Ships, next the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hones, and the Rear conſiſted wholly of the Grand Signior's Gallies. The Van of the Fleet being the Bey's Gallies, which are always the beſt manned, and provided, were ordered to attack the main Body of the Chriſtian Fleet, for that, being ſeconded with the Ships, they would be able to ſuſtain the Shock until the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hones could come up, which were directed againſt the Starboard Wing of the Enemy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of Galleaſſes. The Venetians, though much inferior in Number, yet as great in Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, gave evident Signs of their deſire to fight, with hopes, by God's Bleſſing, to obtain a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Venetians whilſt the Turks paſſed, remained ſtill with their Anchors apique, which the Turks interpreting as a token of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Boldneſs, were ſo daunted, that they began to ply toward the Coaſt of <hi>Greece;</hi> but being forced to paſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                     <p>In ſhort, the Chriſtians boarded the Turks with ſo much Vigour and Reſolution, that they took ſeveral of their Ships, and mixing with the thickeſt of their other Veſſels, they put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Aſhore, and others eſcaping in their Boats, left their Slaves and Gallies to the diſpoſal of the Enemy; ſo that the Venetians obtained that day a hundred braſs Guns, with a ſignal Victory, having had no other important Loſs, unleſs the Ship called the <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> which being overpowered, was burnt by the Turks.</p>
                     <p>The People of the Turks, who were in daily expectation to receive intelligence of a Succeſs, agreeable to ſo great Preparations, were much troubled to hear the News of the Defeat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their Naval Forces; of which Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the World dividing it ſelf into different Conjectures, the moſt part, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> attributed the Misfortune of all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:39539:47"/>to the ill Government, and want of Experience in the General. Wherefore to appeaſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially the Merchants, who were weary of this Marine War; from whence they reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but Loſſes of their Ships and Goods; It was thought fit to enter into a Treaty with Signior <hi>Capello,</hi> the Venetian Bailo, concerning a Peace; but he having his Commiſſion taken from him, for the Reaſon before related, his Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi> ſupplyed his Office; and in Order to an Accommodation, had two Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences with the Great Vizier, to whom, and to others of the Divan, he made Preſents of rich Pieces of Cloth of Gold, in the Name of the Republick. Howſoever the Turks thinking it diſhonourable to accord unto other Terms, than the intire Reſignation of <hi>Candia,</hi> proceeded in their Preparations as formerly; at which the Merchants and Tradeſmen at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch matter of Diſcontentment, that in Tumults they cryed out for Peace at the Gates of the very. Seraglio; and behaved themſelves with that Inſolence, that the Janiſaries were called to drive them from thence by force of Arms; howſoever this Tumult and Riot of the People ended not without the Life of the Great Vizier, to whoſe fury he was made a Sacrifice. And though his Son appeared at the Gates of the City with forty thouſand Men, to demand Juſtice on the Murderers of his Father, yet the People were ſo far from being diſmayed thereat, that their Fury and Rage encreaſed to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er height, and required the Authority of the Divan to keep things from running into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a Civil War.</p>

                     <p>THeſe Diſorders induced the chief Miniſters to enter into another Treaty with <hi>Ballari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> propoſing to withdraw their Forces from <hi>Candia,</hi> and make a Peace, upon the paiment of ten Millions for the Charge of the War: And to incline the Venetians hereunto, the Turks gave ſevere Orders to their People living about <hi>Corfou,</hi> to moleſt the Inhabitants of that Iſland with all Acts of Hoſtility imaginable: and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publiſhed, That their Intentions were to ſet out a more numerous and ſtronger Fleet, than any which from the beginning of this War had ſailed on the Seas; and in order therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, great Numbers of Slaves, conſiſting of Coſſacks and Moſcovites, were bought of the Tartars, and tranſported to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>

                     <p>The Venetians were not in the leaſt affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at theſe Boaſtings of the Turk, but on the contrary, knowing that their Affairs in <hi>Candia</hi> were well ſecured and provided, gave Orders to <hi>Ballarino</hi> to deſiſt from farther Treaties, and to procure his Licence to depart. And the Turks, to evidence their intentions to proſecute the War, entered into <hi>Canea</hi> with twenty eight Sail, laden with Arms and Proviſions, on which alſo were fifteen hundred Men. By this convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was ſent a Janiſar-Aga with Orders from the Grand Signior, to conſtitute <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha in the place of Captain-Paſha, or Admiral of the Seas; but he judging this to be a Deſign, or Lure, to draw him from his Poſt, or Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was more ſtrong and ſecure, acknowledged the Honour of the Employment, but framed Excuſes to continue his Seat and Place of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which the Chief Miniſters were forced to accept; it being a Conjuncture more ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to diſſemble, than to reſent his refuſal.</p>

And to ſo great a height their Rebellion proceeded, that they propoſed even to dethrone the Grand Signior himſelf. And having thus caſt off all Reſpect and Duty to their Prince, they entred the Imperial Palace, and forcing the Guards, broke up the Treaſury, and carried two millions from thence.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt of this horrid and affrighting Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Merchants and well-meaning Citizens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the moſt aſtoniſhing apprehenſions imaginable; for all Laws being broken, and Juſtice unregarded; the whole City laid open to be pillaged and ſacked by the licentiouſnefs of an unbridled Souldiery. For ſeveral days the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both of the Mufti, and Great Vizier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained vacant, by reaſon that the two Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Janiſaries and Spahees could not agree upon the Election. At length the moſt ſeditious amongſt them wearying out the others with Quarrels and Conteſts, advanced a Fellow of no Underſtanding or Reputation to the eminent degree of Great Vizier; in which condition he remained not long. For the Fire of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude being with time quenched, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Heat abated, this new Vizier was diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, all things returning to their uſual Channel, and Authority to its Fountain.</p>
                     <p>And that Matters might more eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to their ancient order, the Grand Signior called for the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to receive the Dignity of Great Vizier; for he being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of eighty Years of Age, and of long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in Affairs, having managed the moſt weighty Charges of the Empire, was looked on by all as the moſt proper Perſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and heal theſe great Diſtempers in the State; and this was that famous <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> who was Father to him who ſucceeded him in this Office.

                     <p>And now the bright Beams of Juſtice and Government having diſſipated the Storms and Fury of popular Sollevations; the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior in Perſon mounting his Horſe, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his principal Miniſters of State, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited all the Parts of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Inquiſition for the principal Leaders and Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of this Rebellion, he ſeized on ſome, and without further proceſs, boldly executed them in the Face of the People.</p>

                     <p>Far having again Equipped a moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Fleet, conſiſting of ſixty light Gallies, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Ships, and nine Galleaſſes; they attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to make their way for <hi>Candia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to fight the Venetians in caſe they ſhould oppoſe them in their Voyage, to which they were the more encouraged upon ſight of the Venetians, who appeared at the Streights of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> with no more than twenty nine Gallies, and ſome Boat, or Brigantines; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Turks were not ſo confident in their numbers, but that they judged it requiſite to fortify themſelves with two Batteries; one on the Coaſt of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and the other on the European ſhore; whereby they imagined, that they might cauſe the Venetians to give way, and open a Paſſage to their Fleet.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding the continual ſhot which the Turks made upon them,<note place="margin">Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Turks and Venetians.</note> they ſtill kept their Station from the <hi>23d</hi> to the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> when the Wind coming about to the North, which was favourable for the Turks to Sail out, and to bring them nearer to their Enemies, they began gently to approach; and the like the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians endeavoured, being deſirous to join Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; at which firmneſs of Reſolution, the Turks being a little ſtartled, became willing to avoid the Fight, and to creep under the ſhelter of the point of <hi>Babiers,</hi> which locks in one of the Bayes between the Caſtles and the Mouth of the <hi>Dardanelli.</hi> But the Wind on a ſudden turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing favourable for the Venetians, the Prior of <hi>Rochelle</hi> with his Squadron, and <hi>Mocenigo</hi> with three Ships under his Command, made up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſtles, with deſign to cut the Turks off from their Retreat; the others valiantly aſſailed the Turks, who defending themſelves like thoſe, whoſe chief ſecurity conſiſts in their Arms, there enſued a moſt miſerable ſlanghter on one ſide,<note place="margin">The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans obtain the Victory.</note> and the other; at length the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Victory happened to the Venetians, who were animated by the couragious Example of their General <hi>Marcello,</hi> though he having Boarded, and become Maſter of a great Ship called a <hi>Soltana,</hi> with the Gally which attended her, was ſhot in the thigh with a Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and thereby gained the glory to die Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering, and Triumphant.</p>
                     <p>After whoſe Death, the Proveditor taking upon him the Command of the Fleet, proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Victory ſo cloſe, that excepting four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies which eſcaped with the Captain-Paſha, and four Gallies of the Bey's; all the whole Flect was either taken, ſunk, or burnt. The Venetians not being able to man all the Veſſels that they had taken, ſet many of them on fire in the Night, excepting only twelve Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, four Ships, and two Galleaſſes, which they reſerved for a Demonſtration or Evidence of their Victory. With this glorious ſucceſs five thouſand poor Chriſtians obtained their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and had their Chains and Shackles knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off. What number the Turks might have loſt is uncertain; but as to the Venetians, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that beſides their General, there were not above three hundred Men in all killed and wounded.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians being encouraged by this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, attacked the Iſland of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> and in the ſpace of four days became Maſters of it; as alſo in a ſhort time afterwards of <hi>Stalimene,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called <hi>Lemnos;</hi> the which ſhameful Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Overthrow, ſo irritated the Mind of the Grand Signior, that he gave Orders to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the War into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> intending the next Summer to go thither in Perſon; and in the mean time Commanded by the Paſha of <hi>Boſna,</hi> that the City of <hi>Raguſa</hi> ſhould be put into a readineſs to receive his Troops, being judged a convenient Place for the Seat and Magazine of Arms for thoſe Countries.</p>

                     <p>This unſeaſonable rigour rather provoked the Spirits of diſcontented Men, than abated them; and the continual Prizes which the Venetians made on the Turks, and ſtoppage of Proviſions, which did uſually ſupply <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> from the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> raiſed the price of Bread, and of all Victuals in that populous City; ſo that the People murmured and exclaimed, as if they had been reduced to their laſt Extremity.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Vizier conſidering that the loſs of <hi>Tenedos</hi> was the cauſe of all theſe Inconviences; promiſed the Inhabitants of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that he would regain it in a ſhort time; in order to which, he ſet forth a very numerous Fleet to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege that Fortreſs; but contrary Winds, and bad Weather, forced them into a Neighbouring Port, where they attended the conjunction of the Bey's Gallies with them.</p>

                     <p>This and other Loſſes augmented the Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſo that the Grand Vizier, to hold up the Spirit of the People, reſolved to go in Perſon to <hi>Tenedos;</hi> and accordingly equipped a Fleet of eighteen Ships, thirty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ten Galleaſſes, with an innumerable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Saiques, and other Veſſels, whereon he embarked twenty thouſand Horſe, and eighty thouſand Foot; with which Army the Vizier ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> having firſt received Intelligence, that <hi>Mocenigo</hi> was not returned from the <hi>Morea,</hi> where he had been for ſome time in chaſe of certain Ships.

The Admiral and Vice-Admiral of the Turks, with five other great Ships, charged the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Admiral, who defended himſelf ſo bravely, that for three hours they lay Board and Board; the reſt of the Turkiſh Fleet aſſailed the other part of their Enemies Fleet ſo cloſe, that the Fight became terrible and bloody, both for one and the other, until at length the Turks being worſted, were put to flight, and in the purſuit, a great Turkiſh Sultana was put aſhore near <hi>Troy;</hi> one of their Galleaſſes was diſabled, two of their Ships ſunk, and the reſt were chaſed as far as <hi>Metylene,</hi> being put by the Iſland of <hi>Tenedos.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe two important Places being regained by the Turks, were the Subject of great Joy to the Court, and of Courage and Satisfaction to the Inhabitants of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> So that the Grand Signior apprehending that by theſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the Seditions and Mutinies of the City were appeaſed, he took his Journey to <hi>Adriano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> where to evidence his Grandeur to the Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo <hi>Capello,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Ballarino,</hi> he made his entry with an Army of twenty thouſand Men, beſides the ordinary Attendance of the Court, and uſual Concomitants of the Ottoman Train.</p>
                     <p>After which Oſtentation, the Grand Signior encharged <hi>Ballarino</hi> to write to the Senate, That though he was able to over-run all their Country, and take from them their Capital City, yet ſuch was his Clemency, that he was contented to grant them Peace, on Conditions that they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred to him all the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> with the Fortreſs of <hi>Cliſſia</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and paiment of three Millions of Gold for the Dammages of the War.</p>

                     <p>NOtwithſtanding the Deſigns of the Turks againſt <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> they were not leſs intent to their Affairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> deſigning to try their Fortune once again in the Siege of the principal City of that Name, for that falling into their Hands, the whole Iſland would quickly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and with that Conqueſt an end would be put unto the War.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians, on the other ſide, attended to their Buſineſs with all diligence, not neglecting any Proviſions which might ſecure their Intereſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:39539:48"/>in that Country; and that they might regain what they had loſt, they held Intelligence with ſome Perſons in <hi>Canea,</hi> hoping by their means to ſurpriſe the Town; but the Turkiſh Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, being very vigilant, reinforced his Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with five hundred Men: and <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha coming to his Aſſiſtance with thirty Gallies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed the Venetians of landing at that place.</p>
                     <p>The Rendezvous of the Army which was to march into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> was ordered to be at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople,</hi> where the Brother-in-Law of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who was Commander of the Forces of that Place, arriving later than the day prefixed, was for that reaſon put to death by the Great Vizier.</p>
                     <p>This Severity ſo enraged the Paſha, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he raiſed an Army of forty thouſand Men, and marched towards <hi>Scutari,</hi> threatning <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf, unleſs the Head of the Great Vizier were given him by way of repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal for that of his Brothers. The Divan being ſtartled hereat, returned him a gentle Meſſage, neither denying nor granting his Demand, as if they intended to amuſe him with Hopes: But he interpreting this Delay for a Refuſal, did not only perfiſt in requiring the Head of the Vizier, but of four other principal Counſellors, whom he judged to have concurred in the Sentence for his Brother's Death; and in farther proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, he burnt and ſpoiled all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and the Plague raging at the ſame time in the City, affected the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants with ſuch Sadneſs and Diſcontent, that the chief Miniſters apprehended more Evil from thence, than from the Enemy without.</p>
                     <p>The Army of the Paſha daily increaſing, and being grown from forty to ſixty thouſand Men, cauſed the Vizier to abandon all other Thoughts and Deſigns but thoſe which tended to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Paſha, and his Complices; ſo that there neceſſarily followed a Revulſion of the Forces from <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> the Vizier himſelf diverting them from thence and <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> marched with the whole Army towards <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet before the Great Vizier departed from <hi>Adrianople,</hi> he perſwaded the Grand Signior to ſet the Bailo <hi>Capello,</hi> and the Secretary <hi>Ballarino</hi> at Liberty, that thereby he might give ſome jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy to the Rebels, as if he deſigned to make a Peace with <hi>Venice,</hi> to have more Power, and better leizure to make his War againſt them. This Counſel, though prudently given, had yet little Influence on the Humor of the Paſha, who continued his March, fortifying himſelf in the moſt advantageous Paſſes of the Country: But what was moſt bold of all his Actions, and rendred his Pardon beyond the Clemency of his Soveraign, was the proclaiming a Youth of twenty Years of Age, then with him in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to be the Son of Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the lawful Heir of the Crown; and that in right of him, he had taken poſſeſſion of a great part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and was marching towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with reſolution to diſpoſſeſs Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Mehmet,</hi> and exalt this lawful and undoubted Heir on the Throne of his Anceſtors.</p>
                     <p>This and other Rumors from <hi>Perſia,</hi> that that King taking the advantage of theſe Diſorders, was making Preparations to regain <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> and revenge himſelf of all thoſe Cruelties which the Turks had inflicted on his Subjects and Country, increaſed the Fears and Cares of the chief Miniſters of State.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding which, <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted his Buſineſs no leſs in <hi>Candia</hi> than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in hopes to put an end to the War there before the end of the Summer; and in order thereunto, he received a Recruit of five and twenty thouſand Men from the <hi>Morea.</hi> But the daily increaſe of the Paſha's Forces, and his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as it was a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the higheſt Conſequence, ſo it required the moſt prudence and caution in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore by <hi>Fetfa,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve from the Mufti, the Paſha was declared a Rebel, and guilty of High Treaſon againſt the Sultan; notwithſtanding which, a Chaous was diſpatched with Letters of Pardon, if now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of his Fault, he would disband his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and return to his former Obedience, he ſhould be received into Grace and Favour. The Paſha received the Chaous with the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Honour, as if he had been an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, being willing to conſider him under that Character, rather than under the Notion of a Purſuivant, or Officer ſent to affright him into his Duty; and in Anſwer to the Meſſage, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, That it was not in his power to condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to any Conditions, for that ſince he had aſſumed the Cauſe of this Youth, who was the Son of Sultan <hi>Morat,</hi> concealed to that Age by his Mother, for fear of the Power of his Uncle, he could not aſſent to any Terms or Conditions leſs than the Exaltation of him to the Ottoman Throne. And ſo carrying this Young Man with him, as a Property, whereby to cover his Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion with the Guiſe of Juſtice and Duty, he maintained a Court for him after the Ottoman Faſhion; and cauſing the Tagho, or Standards, to be carried before him, he permitted him to give Audiences, ſend Diſpatches, and to take on him all the Royal Marks of Empire.</p>
                     <p>The Army of the Paſha was by this time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to ſeventy thouſand Men, one part of which he ſent towards <hi>Scutari,</hi> and another to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which alarm'd all the Countries round about, and gave the Grand Signior ſuch cauſe of Apprehenſion, that he tried divers Means, and made many Propoſitions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Benefits to the Paſha, whereby to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure him to Obedience: One while he offered to him the Government of <hi>Grand Cairo:</hi> but that being rejected, he endeavoured to raiſe Men in <hi>Aſia</hi> to oppoſe the progreſs of his Arms; of which ſome numbers being got into a Body, and perceiving the formidable Force of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, revolted, and joined themſelves to his Party.</p>
                     <p>This Extremity of Affairs, cauſed the Grand Signior not only again to proclaim the Paſha a Rebel, but to give liberty to his People to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him and his Souldiers in any parts where they ſhould encounter them. In purſuance of which Licenſe, a Village in <hi>Aſia</hi> having killed twenty five or thirty of the Paſha's Men, which came thither to refreſh themſelves; the Paſha was ſo enraged thereat, that he cauſed his Souldiers to put Man, Woman, and Child to the Sword throughout the Village. And in this manner the Affairs of the Turks remained in the greateſt Confuſion imaginable through the whole courſe of this Year 1658.</p>

                     <p>NOR did this Year begin with better Omens of Succeſs, for to the other Dangers, was added a Report, that the Perſian had taken the Field with two hundred thouſand Men, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:39539:49"/>of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was the ancient Patrimony of his Forefathers; ſo that the Grand Signior being rendred thereby more willing to agree and accommodate Affairs with the Paſha, proffered to him the Government of the Province of <hi>Soria</hi> for ever, paying only a yearly Homage of an hundred thouſand Sulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees, in lieu of three hundred thouſand, which that Country always yielded. But the Pride of the Paſha ſcorned a Proffer of ſo mean a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, having nothing leſs in his Thoughts than the entire enjoyment of the Empire, or at leaſt to partake an equal ſhare thereof with the Sultan.</p>
                     <p>For the Hopes of the Paſha encreaſing with his Army, which was now grown to eighty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, he took up for ſome days his Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters near the Fortreſs of <hi>Tocacaia,</hi> within the days march of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and thence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters concluded, that there was no other Safety but in their Arms; and that the Paſha was not to be reduced to any terms of Gentleneſs or Moderation. Accordingly the Great Vizier paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into <hi>Aſia</hi> with a numerous Army, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily joined Battel with the Paſha, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for ſome Hours with great ſlaughter on one ſide and the other; but at length the fortune of the Day turned in favour of the Paſha; and the Vizier's Army being routed, he loſt all his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Baggage, and he himſelf was forced to ſave himſelf in the Neighbouring Countries; where not being purſued by the Paſha, he had time again to collect his torn and ſcattered Troops. The News hereof multiplied the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Confuſions at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to which being added the Motion of the Perſians, and that they were to join with the Paſha; as alſo ſome Troubles in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> cauſed by the unquiet Spirit of <hi>Ragotski,</hi> together with the ill Humour of the Male-contents in the City, made all things appear with equal or greater Danger at Home than Abroad.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, as the ultimate Remedy of theſe imminent Dangers it was reſolved, that the Grand Signior ſhould go in Perſon to the War, on ſuppoſition that Reverence to his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would produce that awe on the Spirits of his Subjects, which was not to be effected by Violence, or force of Arms. According to this Reſolution the Grand Signior paſſed into <hi>Aſia,</hi> and joining his Forces with thoſe of the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, compoſed an Army of ſeventy thouſand Foot, and thirty thouſand Horſe; with which marching boldly towards the Enemy, the Heart of the Paſha began to fail him; ſo that calling a Council of his Officers, he propoſed his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations towards Terms of Agreement, rather than to hazard all on the Uncertainties of a Battel; the Spirits of the Souldiery being now become tractable by the appearance of ſo great a Force, aſſented to the Propoſition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Articles being ſpeedily drawn up, were ſent to the Grand Signior for his Approbation; who, though he would not ſeem to refuſe any thing therein contained, yet declined a perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Treaty, as being a Matter too mean for his Imperial Perſon to capitulate with his Vaſſals; and therefore ordered, that <hi>Mortaza</hi> Paſha ſhould Treat in his behalf, promiſing to confirm whatſoever Act <hi>Mortaza</hi> Paſha ſhould conclude in this Matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mortaza</hi> being thus made Plenipotentiary, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to treat with the Paſha, until ſuch time as he had retreated with his Army at a diſtance of ſome days March from the Grand Signior's Camp; which being performed near a Town called <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he fooliſhly ſuffered himſelf to be ſeparated in a private Place from his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, on pretence that Peace was more aptly concluded in a free Retirement, than under the conſtraint and force of the Souldiery. Here <hi>Mortaza</hi> meeting the Paſha, forcibly ſtrangled him, with ſeventeen of his Complices, whom he had brought with him for Witneſſes to his Capitulations with the Grand Signior. With the news hereof the Army of the Paſha ſoon disbanded, every one with ſhame and ſilence ſhifting for himſelf, retired to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Home. And herewith eaſily ended this Civil War almoſt in a moment, which but now threatned the Extirpation of the Ottoman Race.</p>
                     <p>The cruel Vizier retained his thoughts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which we ſhall ſhortly hear in what manner he vented on the great Spahees and rich Men in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who had joined themſelves with the Paſha in this Rebellion. This good Service promoted <hi>Mortaza,</hi> and rendred him more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable to the Grand Signior; ſo that he was employed in the Aſſiſtance of the Tartars, againſt <hi>Ragotski</hi> in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and afterwards preferred to the important Charge of <hi>Bagdat,</hi> or <hi>Babylon,</hi> of whoſe Succeſs, and Fate, we we ſhall hear in the Sequal of a few Years.</p>
                     <p>But as yet the Commotions of <hi>Aſia</hi> were not ſo wholly extinguiſhed, but that the Nephew of the Paſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> in revenge of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Death of his Uncle, took up Arms, and was followed by the People of the Territories depending on <hi>Aleppo.</hi> To his Aſſiſtance came in alſo the Son of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, late General in <hi>Candia,</hi> whom the cruel Vizier had put to death, notwithſtanding the merit of his late Services, which might ſeem to atone for his former Misfortunes, and make ſatisfaction for non-compliance with Inſtructions; but this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, who never pardoned any Perſon, would not begin with an Act of Clemency towards one who was none of his Creatures or Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents depending on him.</p>
                     <p>To theſe joined the Bey of <hi>Torgue,</hi> who caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off his Obedience to the Paſha of <hi>Cairo,</hi> entred into the Cabal with ten thouſand Horſe; ſo that a formidable Army being compoſed by this Union, gave a new ſubject of Fear and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier ſo dextrouſly managed his Affair, by ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſſention between the Chiefs, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Largeſſes on the Souldiery, that the Army unſenſibly mouldred away, leaving their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and Commanders to ſhift for themſelves, and expoſing them to the Juſtice of a Vizier, who was unacquainted with Mercy, and never pardoned any who was either guilty of a Fault, or ſupected for it.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of this Year, the Vizier built the lower Forts, which are ſcituated at the entrance into the <hi>Dardanelles,</hi> commonly called by the name of the Queen-Mother's Caſtles. And diſpatched a Chaous to the Paſha of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> to put all things in a Readineſs for the Siege of <hi>Candia;</hi> Orders were alſo given to the Paſhaws of the Inland Countries to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the Wars againſt <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania.</hi>

                     <p>THE Rendezvous of the Army being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the Vizier haſtened thither in Perſon to quicken the Preparations,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:39539:49"/>and March of the Souldiers, which were flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither from all parts. This Vizier <hi>Kuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> though aged, was yet very active and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, by which he created ſo much confidence of himſelf in his Maſter, that he acted nothing in all the Government but by his Counſel and Direction: which being always jealous and bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy towards thoſe who had any Power in the Empire, he for that Reaſon cut off the Caſir of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who though he was a good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and a faithful Servant, yet becauſe he was a Favourite of the Queen-Mother, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the State of his Affairs in a laudable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, he grew jealous of his Power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſacrificed his Blood to his own Security and Bloody Diſpoſition.</p>
                     <p>The which act of unjuſt Cruelty ſo enraged the Queen-Mother, that ſhe for ever after bore a mortal hatred to this Vizier, and continued the ſame to his Son, which was the famous <hi>Kuperlee;</hi> but his Moderation and Diſcretion was ſo well tempered with reſpect towards her, that She at length not only pardoned the Sin of his Father in him, but became his Friend, and reliſhed the Services which he performed for his Maſter.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians having about this time received conſiderable Succours, namely four thouſand French Foot, which his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, after the Concluſion of Peace at the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, had moſt generouſly Spared to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, were enabled to attempt ſome notable Enterpaize; and thereby ſo hardly preſſed the Paſha of <hi>Canea,</hi> that he earneſtly wrote to the Grand Signior for Succours; aſſuring him, that without preſent Relief, he ſhould be forced to ſurrender his Town to the Mercy of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Grand Signior promiſed him ſpeedy Relief, and for his better encouragement ſent him the Preſent of a Sword and a Veſt of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; in the mean time the Venetians took three Forts, <hi>viz. Calamo, Calegro,</hi> and <hi>Epicarno,</hi> and proceeded to lay Siege to <hi>Canea;</hi> but the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my having received a Supply of three thouſand Men into the Town, the Chriſtians quitted this enterprize in hopes of beating the Turks out of new <hi>Candia;</hi> which was lately built near to the old <hi>Candia,</hi> with deſign to keep that Town ſtraitned by perpetual Alarms, and by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of ſo bad a Neighbourhood.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Vizer being very Aged, was ſubject to many Infirmities, and falling ſick at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> he was adviſed by the Phyſicians to change the Air, as the beſt Remedy for his Diſeaſe; and indeed they were all careful to give him the beſt and ſafeſt Counſels, for that he often threatned them, if he died of that Sickneſs, he would ſend them all to the next World before him. The Vizier following the Advice of his Phyſicians, returned to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a good meaſure recovered his Health, he ſent Orders to <hi>Hali</hi> Paſha, then General of the Forces in <hi>Hungary,</hi> to haſten the Siege of <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> being eſteemed by the Turks an advantagious Fortreſs for carrying on their Conqueſts in that Country; of the taking of which Town, and of all the Trouble in <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> cauſed by the ambitious humour of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> we ſhall treat at large in the following Hiſtory. For being come to that time, in which Providence allotted me a charge at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> I was thereby ſomewhat elevated on a riſing Ground, whereby I could with my own Eyes ſurvey the Tranſactions of that great Empire; and for that Reaſon I call them my Memoirs; which for being Matters tranſacted in my own Time, I have thought fit to introduce them with a ſhort Advertiſement to the Reader.</p>

My latter time, which was that of being Conſul, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me to an attendance on matters relating to the government of our Trade; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not to be expected, that at that diſtance from the Court, I ſhould lay down Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſo poſitive, and particular, as in the preceding Years; yet the acquaintance, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence I afterwards continued at Court, and the care I took to inform my ſelf of what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, qualified me in ſome meaſure for an Hiſtorian; at leaſt put me into a condition to make a Breviate, or Collection of certain Obſervations occurring in the Turkiſh Court.</p>
                  <p>When I firſt entred on this work, I was carried with a certain emulation of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Writers, of whoſe Miniſters few there were employed in the parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> but who carried with them from thence, Memoirs, Giornals, or Hiſtorical Obſervations of their times. In which our Nation hath been ſo defective, that beſides ſome ſcattered and abrupt Papers, without coherence, or method, adjoined to the end of <hi>Knoll</hi>'s Hiſtory of the <hi>Turks</hi> (which is an excellent collection from divers Authors.) one ſhall ſcarce find five ſheets of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wrote by our Countrymen in way of Hiſtory. At which omiſſion having often wondred, I reſolved from my firſt entrance in thoſe Countries, to note down in a blank Book what occurred in that Empire, either as to Civil, or Military affairs; with what Caſualties and Changes befel our Trade, that ſo both one and the other might ſerve for Examples and Precedents to future Ages; the which after ſome years afforded me materials to compoſe and frame this following Diſcourſe. In which, having by Gods aſſiſtance thus far proceeded; As it may be an Example to my Succeſſors, to ſpin and draw out the thread of this Hiſtory through Ages to come; ſo it will be a good part, and office, of thoſe who reſide there at preſent, by a more diligent enquiry to correct, and amend what I have miſtaken, or miſunderſtood.</p>
                  <p>For next to the immediate attendance to the Charge and Truſt impoſed upon me, I judged it a chief duty towards my Country, to denote and Record certain Tranſactions relating to Trade, which is the grand Intereſt that hath engaged <hi>England</hi> to a Communication and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with theſe remote Parts: nor doth the World perhaps expect much leſs from me, than that I ſhould add ſomething to the Hiſtory of the <hi>Turks</hi> in our time; which howſoever imperfectly I may perform it, yet the Offices which I have exerciſed, and the impartiality with which it is wrote, may gain it ſome credit and reputation in the World. For in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereof, I cannot be taxed with animoſity to any perſon; nor am I to be eſteemed as poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with affection, or partiality to any ſide; which is a point of ſobriety, and good temper, neceſſary for all Hiſtorians: For we who lived in thoſe parts, were little concerned for the Houſe of <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> or for the Favourites of the Court; nor was it of any moment to us, whether the Faction of the <hi>Spahees,</hi> or <hi>Janizaries</hi> prevailed; or whether the Courtiers, or the Soldiers, ruled the Empire: only we eſteemed it our duty, to ſpeak beſt of that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under which our Trade thrived moſt. And tho the times of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim</hi> were the golden days for Merchants, which employed our Navigation beyond the memory of any times, either before, or ſince; and conſumed of our Manufactories (tho not in greater quantities yet) perhaps with better advantage and profit to our Nation: Yet I ought not to be ſo injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or ungrateful to <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, as to accuſe his Government of Oppreſſion, or Violence towards us, or of any breach of Articles, and Priviledges, which he had granted to his Majesties Subjects; but ſhall rather applaud, and be ready to own that Justice which our Complaints have found, and met at the Ottoman Court, under the protection of thoſe worthy Ambaſſadors ſent by his Majesty to stand Centinel on the Guard of their Country.</p>
                  <p>For whereas in the time of <hi>Sultan Morat,</hi> when the Military men bore the ſway; Injustice and Violence, which mingled in all the actions of Rule, had an influence alſo on the Engliſh
<pb facs="tcp:39539:52"/>affairs: And when in the time of <hi>Sultan Ibrahim,</hi> that the Female Court had gained the predominancy, and that vaſt Treaſures were expended in Riot and Luxury; the prodigality of great perſons made it neceſſary to be rapacious and unjuſt: But in theſe more moderate times of this preſent Sultan, when neither exceſſive Wars abroad, nor Luxury nor immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate expence at home, exhauſted the Coffers; We may eaſily imagine, that the diſorders of State did not drive the Rulers to a neceſſity of exerciſing unjuſt Arts, which are always moſt certain Symptoms, either of a bad Government, or a vicious incliuation in the Prince.</p>
                  <p>The Engliſh Trade, according to the Chronicles of Sir <hi>Richard Baker,</hi> was firſt introduced into the Country of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in the Year 1579. but <hi>Sagredo</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> Writer, accounts only from the Year <hi>1583.</hi> perhaps before that time Overtures were only made for a Trade, which might be ſo inconſiderable, as that until then it was not eſteemed worthy to be adorned with an Ambaſſador, or to be oppoſed by the Miniſters of Foreign Princes. For ſo ſoon as an Ambaſſador from <hi>England</hi> appeared at the Ottoman Court, with Credential Letters from Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetian</hi> Miniſters took the Alarm, and oppoſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, eſpecially the <hi>French,</hi> who (as <hi>Sagredo</hi> reports in his Hiſtory of the <hi>Turks</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented unto the G. Vizier, how much this new Friendſhip with the Engliſh would obſtruct that ancient Alliance which was made with his King, and would impeach and leſſen the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges and Trade which they enjoyed in thoſe parts: To which the Vizier anſwered, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their uſual phraſe and ſtile; That the happy Imperial Seat where his Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, was called the <hi>Port,</hi> becauſe it was free and open to all ſuch who deſired to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and ſanctuary therein, and therefore the Engliſh without juſt reaſon ought not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. That the Sultan ought not to be denied that freedom of love and hatred, which was common to all Mankind; and that he was as well reſolved to chuſe and cheriſh his Friends, as to proſecute and deſtroy his Enemies. Whereunto the French Ambaſſador urged, That ſince it was the pleaſure of the Grand Signior to admit the Engliſh; that at leaſt they ſhould be obliged to enter <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under the French Colours. But the Engliſh Ambaſſador replied, that his Miſtreſs who was ſo potent, ſcorned all Dependencies on other Nations, and would rather abandon the Friendſhip of the Sultan, than admit the leaſt diminution of her own honour: And embelliſhing his Diſcourſes (as <hi>Sagredo</hi> proceeds) with the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that advantage and profit, which the Engliſh Trade would bring to the Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; he ſo enſnared the hearts of the Turks, that they preferred the admittance of new Gueſts, before the Alliance of ancient Friends. Since which time our Commerce and Trade with the Turk hath been in its increaſe, and being governed by a Wiſe and Grave Company of Experienced Merchants, hath by Gods bleſſing brought an ineſtimable Treaſure and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the Engliſh Nation, which that it may ſtill continue, increaſe, and flouriſh in all Ages and times to come, is the hearty deſire, and Prayer of him, who is a true, and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to that worthy Society, and a ſincere Wellwiſher to his Country.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>IT was now the beginning of this Year, when the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the firſt Embaſſadour ſent abroad from His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain, Charles</hi> the Second, after his happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Glorious throne of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, to <hi>Sultan Mahomet,</hi> the Thirteenth Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of the Turks; it being judged fit, that amongſt other Alliances which were to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with Foreign Princes, and States, this of <hi>Turkey</hi> ſhould not be omitted, but rather in the firſt place conſidered: In regard, that as the flouriſhing Eſtate and Proſperity of <hi>England</hi>'s richeſs depends abſolutely on her Foreign Trade, ſo on none more particularly than on that of <hi>Turkey,</hi> which conſumes great quantities of her moſt ſtaple and ſubſtantial Manufactures, and makes returns in whatſoever Employs, and gives Bread to the poor and induſtrious of the Nation.</p>
                     <p>But before we come to treat of the Succeſſes of this Ambaſſador, and the various Tranſactions in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Affairs; we ſhall relate ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents which befel us in our Voyage by Sea to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> and his Lady, with a numerous Retinue being embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Frigat, commanded by Sir <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> and accompanied with a Catch and two Merchants Ships, the <hi>Proſperous</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> Factor for <hi>Turkey,</hi> ſet ſail from the <hi>Downs</hi> on the Twentieth of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1660. And proceeding with a favourable Gale, and fair Weather, until we were come to the heighth of the Norward Cape, or Cape <hi>Finiſterre;</hi> we then contended with ſo ſevere a ſtorm, that we were forced to bring our Ship under a main courſe, to faſten our Helm, and lye, and drive. In the Twenty nineth about Five in the Morning, our main Tack flew, which ſhook and ſtrained our Maſs ſo violently, that it was ſhivered in two places between Decks: The danger hereof might have proved of ill conſequence, had the Maſt gone by the Board; for in all probability it would have carried up our Decks, unfixed both our Pumps, and laid us open to the Sea; but the Providence of God, and the diligence of our
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:39539:53"/>Seamen was ſuch, that we ſoon ſtruck our Top Maſt, boared our main Yard, and ſo fiſhed the Maſt it ſelf where it was defective, that with the help of our ſore-Sail, and the benefit of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Weather we ſafely arrived on the Thirty firſt in the Port of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lisbon.</note> The Match being then in Treaty between <hi>Charles</hi> the Second our Dread Soveraign, and <hi>Catherine</hi> the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugal,</hi> now our gracious Queen; all the concernments of <hi>England</hi> were extreamly acceptable to the Court of <hi>Portugal;</hi> and particularly the Perſon of the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> a Peer of <hi>England,</hi> qualified with the Character of Ambaſſadour Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Port. For at our firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val there, I being then Secretary to the ſaid Earl, was employed to carry a Letter to the King, which was received by the Councel of State then ſitting: After the Letter had been read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, I was called in, and an anſwer given me by the <hi>Marquis de Niſſa,</hi> and <hi>D. Gaſper Faria de Sevarin</hi> then Secretary of State, to this purpoſe. That they were glad, ſo grateful an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preſented, whereby they might Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate their warm and real affections towards the King of <hi>England,</hi> by ſerving his Ambaſſadour in ſo neceſſary a piece of Service as that which was required: That Orders were given to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Ship with a Maſt, and what ſhe wanted, out of the Kings Stores; and that both his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and Lady, with all their Retinue ſhould be welcomed a ſhore, with due regard to their Quality and Condition. The Day following his Excellency was complemented from the King, by a <hi>Maeſtro de Campo</hi> ſent to him on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board; and being come aſhoar, and lodged at the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul, he was viſited by <hi>D. Franciſco de Melo,</hi> (who had beſore, and was afterwards employed Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour into <hi>England</hi>) and by <hi>D. Antonio de Saouſa</hi> and others. After Eight days his Excellency had Audience of the King, and the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and was received by both, with many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of a hearty deſire to contract a firm Alliance with <hi>England.</hi> He was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards invited by the <hi>Conde de Odemira</hi> Governour of the young King, and Chief Miniſter of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> to a <hi>Quinta,</hi> or Garden-houſe at <hi>Bellain:</hi> where were preſent the Duke of <hi>Calaval,</hi> the <hi>Viſconde de Caſtel Blanco,</hi> and <hi>D. Franciſco de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo;</hi> the entertainment was very ſplendid, with variety of Diſhes, and Wine, correſponding ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the inordinate Tables of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than with the frugality, and temperate Diet of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards.</hi> Our Ship being in this interim refitted, we returned aboard on the Twelſth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi> the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> being preſented by the King, with ſeveral Hampers of ſweet-Meats, Veſſels of Wine, and other Proviſions for his Voyage; and his lady by the Queen Mother, with a Jewel of conſiderable value, and with diverſe boxes filled with Purſes of perſumed Leather, and Amber Comfits.</p>
                     <p>On the Thirteenth we ſet Sail, being deſign'd by Order of his Majeſty for <hi>Algier,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Algier.</note> to ſettle a Peace with that unſetled People; where arriving on the Tewenty ſecond day about Three a Clock in the Afternoon, we came to an Anchor about Two Miles diſtant from the Town, which we ſaluted with Twenty one Guns, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived none again in anſwer thereunto; it being the cuſtome of that People, not to acknowledge Civilities, but to repay injuries, and not requite benefits. We found that they had already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to break the Peace: Having brought in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, which lay between hope and fear of freedom, or ſeizure: So ſoon as we had dropt our Anchors, a Boat came from that Ship, acquainting us of the State of <hi>Algter,</hi> and how near Matters were to a Rupture with them; by this Boat my Lord Ambaſſadour ſent a Letter to the Conſul, appointing him to come aboard; who the next Day, being the Twenty third, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared accordingly; to whom his Excellency imparted the Inſtructions and Orders from his Majeſty to renew the Peace on the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and particularly to inſert a Caution, That the <hi>Algerines</hi> ſhould on no terms ſearch our Ships, but that the Paſſengers, and goods there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether of <hi>Engliſh</hi> or Strangers, ſhould be free and exempted from all ſeizure, and Pyracy whatſoever. I being appointed to aſſiſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul in this Treaty, accompanied him aſhoar, and in the firſt place we applyed our ſelves to <hi>Rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Bullock-baſhee,</hi> then the Chief of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, and Head of their Government; whom we acquainted, that on the Ship in the road, was an Earl of <hi>England,</hi> ſent Ambaſſadour by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty our King to the Grand Signor; and in his way thither was appointed to touch at <hi>Algier,</hi> and to inform the Government of that place of the happy Reſtoration of his Majeſty to the Throne of his Father, and to confirm the ſame Peace which was before concluded with uſurped Powers, and ſo delivered him the Letters from his Majeſty, which were ſuperſcribed in this manner:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>To their Excellencies the Aga, Jiabaſhees, and reſt of the Honourable Council of State and War, in the City and Kingdom of</hi> Algier.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ramadam</hi> anſwered us, that he was well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Propoſal; that there was a Peace already with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that they were Brothers; that the next Day was appointed for a general Divan of great and ſmall, at which we might freely open our breaſts, and declare whatſoever was committed to us by our King and his Ambaſſadour.</p>
                     <p>But for the better underſtanding of the State of <hi>Algier,</hi> at this time, we muſt obſerve, that for many years before, this government was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a Divan, the Chief and Head whereof was a Paſha ſent every Three years to preſide there, and had ſo continued, until that ſome few Months before this time one <hi>Halil</hi> a poor Fellow, who had no better Eſtate than the Sixteenth part of a Veſſel, but bold and deſperate, complained one Day in open Divan againſt the Paſha, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him of many miſcarriages, with which he ſo affected the Divan; that he rudely threw him from his Seat, drubbed him, trampled on him, and plucked the Hairs out of his Beard, which is the greateſt mark of ignominy and contempt that any Perſon can offer to another; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving committed him to Priſon and Chains, he with the Divan took upon himſelf the unlimited Power of an Arbitrary Government: And thus for the ſpace of Six or Eight Months this Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creant tyrannized, and ruled without controul: Until an obſcure and contemptible Moor, an ordinary Jerbin or Countryman, inſtigated (as was ſuppoſed) by the Aga, or General of the Souldiery, approaching near him in the Streets, under pretence of kiſſing his Veſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Halil</hi> killed by a Moor.</note> ſtruck him with a long Knife between the Ribs; which bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Moor ſo aſtoniſhed the Attendants which were about him, that none had power to lay hands on the Murderer, but ſuffered him to depart, and fly unpurſued: Of this wound <hi>Halil</hi> dyed in Two days, in which time be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>Ramadam</hi> his Kinſman to be the moſt Proper, and fit Perſon to ſucced him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:39539:53"/>and this recommendation ſo prevailed on the Divan, that he was elected for their Chief: A Perſon of a moſt ſordid, and Mercenary Soul, immerſed in Covetouſneſs, and Gluttony, guided by his Luſt and Intereſt, unleſs ſome times reſtrained by the Authority of the Divan, and the fear of popular Inſurrection.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Ramadam</hi> according to his Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited, ſummon'd us the day following, being the Twenty-fourth to the Divan;<note place="margin">The <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier</hi> Divan.</note> which conſiſts in all of Twenty-four Bulluck-baſhees, who are Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Souldiery, each commanding Twenty-four Souldiers under him,<note n="*" place="margin">Jiaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhees are of another degree; it may be in good <hi>Turkiſh</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabaſhees, or Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries.</note> Twenty-four Jia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhees, and Eighteen Ancients or grave Seniors: Though for that preſent, there appeared no more than Forty-five, the others being at Sea, or abroad; <hi>Ramadam</hi> was placed in the Chair, or in a Seat at the upper end, and the Aga ſate by him, the others ſtood on their feet, and put themſelves into Two Files, or Ranks; and then <hi>Ramadam</hi> began with a loud Voice to cry, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> are come to treat a Peace with you, and have brought Letters from their King, and from their Ambaſſadour now aboard going for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> which very words every one diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pronounced, and repeated them, carrying the Voice from the lower to the upper end; I fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, that it was after the manner of our repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Syllogiſms in diſputations, that ſo no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake might be, and that the Reſpondent might have time to conſider and weigh the argument. Then <hi>Ramadam</hi> demanded, whether they were pleaſed to enter into Treaty with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> which words being repeated as before, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Affirmative, the Letters were read in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tranſlation; with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace propoſed, which were as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:

                     <p>Theſe Articles being read, were all approved except the firſt; for they declared, that they would have a Liberty to ſearch our Ships, and take out the Goods and Perſons of Strangers; for that otherwiſe, we having this priviledge, might carry away the Trade of the whole World in our Shipping; and that <hi>French, Spaniards, Italians, Dutch,</hi> and all other Nations, had no need of other protection and ſafeguard for their Perſons and Goods, than to put them under the <hi>Engliſh</hi> colours: And that then their men of War might rove the Seas to no purpoſe, their City become poor, and their Souldiers ſtarve, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home. We on the other ſide, being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how prejudicial and diſhonourable ſuch an Article as this would be, and how ruinous to our Navigation, and having his Majeſties Command to the contrary, abſolutely refuſed to aſſent, or agree thereunto. Whilſt we were thus arguing, a great fat <hi>Turk</hi> appeared with two young men his Slaves, one a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and the other a <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> requeſting <hi>Ramadam</hi> to recommend him to us for paſſage to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and having performed his requeſt to him by kiſſing his Hand, <hi>Ramadan</hi> made it his requeſt to us in behalf of that his Kinſman, recommending him to our care and protection, and conjuring us thereunto, by that Sacred league of Peace that was between us: We readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto, and at the ſame time took hold of the Example to repreſent the reaſonableneſs of that Article on which we inſiſted. For ſhall we (ſaid we) protect your People, and will you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and impoſe it upon us as a matter Juſt and Sacred? And ſhall not the greatneſs of our King have a Liberty to diſpence the like Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge to other Nations, his Neighbours, and Allies, governed by Kings and Princes, who are Chriſtian, and of his Kindred, and near Relations? But neither this, nor any other argument was Reaſon, or Sence to them; nor did they care to anſwer it by other arguments, than that of their own diſadvantage thereby; and that if they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented thereunto, their Ships might better rot in the Mould, than to venture them out at Sea with expectation of booty. They told us alſo ſtories of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships which had delivered ſome <hi>Algerines</hi> to their Enemies; and one particularly, who had ſold a Hundred <hi>Turks</hi> to the <hi>Venetians.</hi> In anſwer hereunto, we aſſured them, that upon complaints and proofs made hereof to our King; his Juſtice was ſuch, as that he would not ſuffer a piece of ſuch Treachery to eſcape unpuniſhed. And as to that argument, which they urg'd, that in this Caſe none would be employed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhips; we largely repreſented the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of employing <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the Ships of other Nations. But theſe People being Deaf and Blind to any Reaſon, but that which agrees with their intereſt, we concluded nothing; for after a long and loud diſcourſe, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame things over and over again, we at length told them, that it was not in our Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to conclude on theſe terms; but that we ſhould inform the Lord Ambaſſadour of their deſires, and reſolution, and that we would return the next Day with his peremptory Anſwer; not but we knew, that the Inſtructions from his Majeſty extended not ſo far; but that we might have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to leave matters, as it were in ſuſpenſe, and part fairly from them, at the preſent. For
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:39539:54"/>as to my own particular, I did not like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with ſuch Company, not knowing how far the perfidiouſneſs of that People might tranſport them to a Barbarity againſt the Laws of Reaſon and Nations.</p>
                     <p>The wind blew all this day ſo hard at Weſt, that our Ship drove, and a great Sea went; ſo that there was ſome difficulty for me to get aboard; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in regard it was neceſſary to render his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency an account of the proceedings of that Day, I eaſed the Pinnace of all Proviſions, and unneceſſary Company, and ſo by God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence got ſafe, though wet, aboard that Evening. I did not fail immediately to render an account moſt exactly, how every thing paſſed, to the Lord Ambaſſadour, letting him know, what fruit was to be expected by a farther Treaty with this People. Wherefore it was thought fit rather to keep the buſineſs in ſuſpence, than to come to an open rupture with them; and rather than to uſe long diſcourſe to them, or perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to little purpoſe, to write them this ſhort Letter, the ſuperſcription of which was to <hi>Ramadam</hi> their Governour in Chief, and to the reſt of the Divan.</p>

This is an Article which the King my Master did not think you would have inſiſted Uſurpers, and his Subjects, and therefore did not impower me to conclude with you in it. Howſoever, I ſhall acquaint the King my Maſter of your earneſt Deſires, and Reſolves in this Buſineſs, and doubt not, but what is Juſt and Reaſonable, will be aſſented unto.

                     <p>Upon delivery of this Letter, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the former Articles ſhould ſtand in force; only that difference about ſearching our Ships ſhould remain in ſuſpence, and be ſpecified, as not fully agreed on: Howſoever they would ſearch our Ships, and it ſhould not be accounted a breach of our Capitulations, until the King ſhould intimate his diſlike thereof. And that when Notice ſhould come from his Majeſty to <hi>Algier,</hi> that he approved not thereof, then it ſhould be lawful for both ſides to break into Acts of Hoſtility. This moderate courſe we thought to be leſs prejudicial to us for the preſent, than an open, and ſudden War: For by this means we gained the releaſement of two ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships which their Men carried in thither, and had time to give notice to our Merchants in all Ports and places, of the true ſtate of our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with <hi>Algier.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the Twenty-ſeventh of <hi>November,</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the bay of <hi>Algier</hi> with a proſperous, and ſteddy Gale, ſteering N.E. and N.N.E. for <hi>Meſſina,</hi> from whence we intended to diſpatch Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters unto all places, rendring advices to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and the Merchants, of the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Affairs, and Negotiation at <hi>Algier:</hi> And whilſt we pleaſantly ſail'd with a proſperous wind, on a ſudden a cry was made of Fire, in the Ship, which aſtoniſhed us all with a great amazement. For the Cooper it ſeems, going into the Steward's Room to ſtave a Cask which formerly had ſome Brandy in it, by chance a Snuff of the Candle fell in at the bung, which put the whole Veſſel into a Flame: But the ſame Man immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſtopping the Bung, ſoon ſmothered the Fire, and therewith extinguiſh'd thatand our fears. As to other Matters,<note place="margin">Meſſina</note> our Voyage to <hi>Meſſina</hi> was ſpeedy and happy, for we arrived there on the Second of <hi>December.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Some Days paſſed before we could get pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; for having touched at <hi>Algier,</hi> a place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpected for the Plague, great ſcruple was made of admitting us to free converſe in the Town: Until the Lord Ambaſſadour gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Hand and Seal an aſſurance of the Health of our Ship; on confidence of which we received Pratick, and the Palace called Paradiſe, where commonly the Vice-Kings are lodged, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to receive his Excellency and his Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and the Furniture thereof ordered by <hi>D. Franciſco de la Villa Padierna,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was <hi>Stratago,</hi> which is as much Commander in chief of all the Caſtles and Forts in and about <hi>Meſſina.</hi> So ſoon as his Excellency landed, this <hi>Stratago</hi> made him a Viſit, and at his departure left his Guard with him in a Complement, but in the mean time the <hi>Jurati,</hi> who were ſix in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, choſe (as I think) every year, or every third year by the Citizens for Government of the City, were wanting in the like civility towards our Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador; four of which are choſen out of the Burgers, and two out of the Gentry, for they took no notice of him, nor ſent him any meſſage until the hour that he was about to depart, when his Excellency refuſed to receive their viſits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing his neglect of attendance to matters of Ceremony, at a time when buſineſs urged his departure: whence this omiſſion on the Jurats ſide proceeded, may in probability be deriv'd from the antipathy they have to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and their Government, always running contrary to that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they find the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. During our abode at this place his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency having returned his Viſit to the <hi>Stratago,</hi> accompanied with <hi>D. Joſeppe de Luna</hi> a Cavalier of <hi>Maltha,</hi> and having wrote a Letter to the <hi>Conde de Ayala</hi> then Vice-King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> reſiding at <hi>Palermo,</hi> he gave advices unto all places of the doubtful ſtate of our affairs with <hi>Algiers,</hi> that ſo Ships might be cautious of that people, and how they adventured themſelves abroad without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy; and having compleated theſe Diſpatches, we again returned aboard on the ninth of this Month; when the <hi>Stratago,</hi> abounding in all points of civility, ſent an honourable preſent of all ſorts of freſh proviſions aboard Ship, and ſoon after came himſelf in perſon to bid Farewel to his Excellency. At his coming aboard we gave him nine Guns, and at his going off fifteen, and ſo ſoon as our Anchors were away, and our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top-Sail filled, we bid adieu to the Town with twenty one Guns more, which they returned by firing all the Guns of the five Caſtles, under command of that <hi>Stratago,</hi> which is an honour they ſeldom pay to any other, than the <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Vice-King, and the Popes Admiral.</p>
                     <p>We had ſo fair a Wind, and ſo proſperous a paſſage, that we arrived at <hi>Smyrna</hi> on the 14th of

                        <hi>December,</hi> where we found the <hi>Proſperous</hi> and <hi>Smyrna</hi> Factor, the Merchants Ships which we had loſt in the Storm,<note place="margin">Smyrna.</note> happily arrived. Here we remained for ſome days to order and ſettle ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affairs according to Inſtructions given by the <hi>Turky</hi> Company.

                        </gap>er of that Iſle: All this night the wind ſo increaſed one hour more than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that in the morning it was grown to a perfect ſtorm, and the Sea into a breach; the sky was ſo black, and thick, and the Sun ſo red, and louring, as ſignified the continuance of it; and the ſpray of the Sea was ſo forcibly carried by the wind over the Ship, that Maſts, Yards, and Decks were querned with a white Salt. This extremity of weather made us think of ſome Port, or Harbour, wherein to ſecure our Ship. The Iſland of <hi>Ipſera</hi> lying <hi>S. B. W.</hi> about eight Leagues from <hi>Mytilene,</hi> was judged by our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be the moſt convenient and ſafe place, wherein we might ſpend the fury of this ſtorm; wherefore putting before it with our Foreſail, and our Mainſail in the Brailes,<note place="margin">A miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from ſhipwrack</note> the wind was ſo forcible, that it carried away our Foreſail like Paper from the Yard; and bringing another in the place thereof, it had the misfortune to be ſoul of the ſlook of our Anchor, and ſo became as unſerviceable as the former: being thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the benefit of our commanding Sails, we ſet our Spritſail, and Main-courſe, and ſo ſteered in between the two Iſles of <hi>Ipſera</hi> the greater; and the leſs. Being ſhot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and keeping as near aluff as we could to the ſhore, we on a ſudden ſtruck upon a Rock, which aſtoniſhed us all with a ſtrange amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the Ship fetched five Sallies, or Seeles upon it with ſuch violence, that we expected to ſink immediately into the deep; and indeed if we conſider the forcibleneſs of the wind, the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Sea, and the weight of our burden, having four hundred perſons aboard, and ſixty Guns mounted, it will appear little leſs than a Miracle, that the Ship brake not into more pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces than our numbers were aboard. I ſtood then by the Mate, when he fathomed our depth of water by the Lead and Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>; and we had then ſeventeen foot and a half by the ſide, but the Ship drawing eighteen foot, we began to fear a total ruin, and ſhipwrack, and with caſt-up eyes, and ſtretched out arms, thought now of no other than of our laſt and ultimate Port. But in the midſt of this horrid conſternation and diſtreſs, it pleaſed God, who was our beſt Pilot, and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to the edg of the Rock, to bring us clear of it; when we ſoon eſpied ſome of our ſheathing to ſwim upon the Sea; and running down to the Well of our Pumps, we perceived a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of water, but not ſo much but that Pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping once every half hour, we kept our Ship in a condition of ſafety. Being thus by Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence come to a convenient place of Anchorage, being well furniſhed with ground-Tackle we rode for two days in a ſtreſs of wind, with two Anchors a head, of which our ſheet-Anchor was one, and with our Top-maſts and Yards ſtruck. Afterwards the wind abating ſomething of its late fierceneſs, though continuing in the ſame quarter, we had opportunities to go aſhore and to make ſome Proviſions of Wine, of which that Iſland yields an admirable ſort, and as rich as any in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> though the people are as poor, or rather more miſerable than their Neighbours.

                     <p>On the Seventeenth Day about Noon, being juſt Three months ſince the Lord Ambaſſador with his Family embarked, we came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor near the Seven Towers, from whence we gave notice to St. <hi>Thomas Bendyſh</hi> of our near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and having given Two hours ſpace for to carry the intelligence, we weighed our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and ſtood in for the Port of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> At this time, a <hi>Boſtangee,</hi> one belonging to the Grand Signior's Garden, came aboard, ſent by the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtangee</hi>-baſhee or Head of the Gardeners, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, and know what Ship it was of ſuch Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, and greatneſs; adviſing us alſo, that the Grand Signior was ſeated in a Chiosk or Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe on the corner Wall of the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Having thus our Anchor aboard with a freſh and favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablegale, our Flags and Enſigns diſplayed, and a Streamer at every Yard-arm, our Guns and Waſt-clothes out; and being near the Wall of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> the ſame <hi>Boſtangee</hi> came again aboard, acquainting us, that it was the Grand Signior's pleaſure, that we ſhould rejoyce with Guns, (which was his expreſſion;) the Ship having her Sails ſwelled out with a gentle Gale, and the ſwiftneſs of her motion retarded by the current, gave the Turks an opportunity to take a full proſpect of her, the decks being full of men; we fired Sixty one Guns, as we paſſed,<note place="margin">Salutation of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio.</hi>

He anſwered, not well, but with an envious Eye, as he ſuppoſed; let them burſt with malice, replied the Vizier. Of late years ſince the glory and greatneſs of <hi>France,</hi> their Ambaſſadors have been always tranſported up to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the Kings Ships.

All which before they entered <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made a ſtop about the Seven Towers, capitulating firſt to have a re-ſalute from the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> before they would paſs their Complement to that place; which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, as a thing never practiſed; the <hi>French</hi> Men of War have of late paſſed with ſilence, without giving, or receiving a ſalute: Howſoever, as things ſtand now, I ſhould ſcarce adviſe, that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men of War ſhould inſiſt upon the like, for we having once done it, a cuſtom may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that may give a beginning to ſuch a diſpute which a new Ambaſſador ought ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly to avoid, the preſent circumſtances of <hi>France</hi> not ſuiting exactly with the ſole Intereſt of Trade which is exerciſed by <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>His Excellency being thus lodged at his Houſe at <hi>Pera,</hi> he was immediately ſaluted from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Reſident by his Secretary; and ſoon after by Signor <hi>Padavino</hi> Secretary to their Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <hi>Balarino</hi> and <hi>Capello,</hi> of whom we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have occaſion to name, being thoſe who negotiated the Affairs of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick.

                     <p>Three days after, the Grand Signior ſent a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Excellency of Ten Sheep, Fifty Hens,<note place="margin">The Grand Signiors preſent to the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> a Hundred Loaves of Bread, Twenty Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaves, Twenty Wax-candles, Ten whereof were white, and Ten yellow. This we mention particularly, becauſe it was a Gift anciently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed in the times of the firſt Ambaſſadors; and though it had not been of late years pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, yet being found in the Old Regiſters, the cuſtom was again revived, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:39539:55"/>were in an humour to gratifie, and ſhew all the Honour they could to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</p>
                     <p>On the Twenty eighth of this Month of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary,</hi> his Excellency had his firſt Audience of the Great Vizier;<note place="margin">His firſt Audience with the Vizier.</note> and being attended thither, ad met by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers on <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſide, (in the ſame manner, as when he firſt landed) he was conducted to the Viziers Palace; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held up under the Arm by Two of his Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (that being the faſhion of great men amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi>) he was introduced to the Preſence of the Vizier; who being aged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, was ſitting on Cuſhions in a little Room with a Fire, and his Feet covered, ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaws, Pages, and other Officers ſtanding by him. His Excellency and Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh</hi> were ſeated on Two Velvet ſtools; where firſt the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> having preſented the King's Letters to the Vizier wrote in Parchment, and put into a Bag of Cloth of Gold; Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh</hi> began to inform the Vizier, that this was that honourable Perſon, of whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted him, was coming to reſide for Ambaſſador in his place: That he was of that Nobility, and relation to our King, that had not his Majeſty intended highly, and in an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner to Honour, and oblige the Grand Signior, he would not have expoſed his Kinſman, and a Perſon extraordinary, to the hazard of a Voyage ſo long and dangerous as this. Then the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi>-began to ſpeak, and relate the happy reſtauration of the King his Maſter to the Throne of his Anceſtors; extolling his Power, Greatneſs and Clemency in pardoning all, but ſuch, who were engaged in the Blood of his Father. That in his paſſage to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> he had by Command of the King touched at <hi>Algier,</hi> endeavouring to renew the former Articles of Peace, and releaſe an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord (meaning the Lord <hi>Obryan</hi>) taken Captive by them contrary to the Articles of Peace, but without ſucceſs, not being able to reduce them to any Terms of Reaſon, or Juſtice: And enlarging in his Complements with aſſurances of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which the King his Maſter deſired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and maintain with the Grand Signior, as a token thereof, he acquainted him, that he was the firſt Ambaſſador ſent abroad by his Maſter, ſince his happy return, before he had deſigned, or appointed any to Chriſtian Princes. The Vizier readily anſwered: <hi>That it was but Reaſon it ſhould be ſo; ſince the Grand Signior was an Emperor, and they but Kings; and he the greateſt, and moſt Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Potentate of the World: And that as to the Buſineſs of</hi> Algier, <hi>he would take care of it, and do him Juſtice.</hi> This having paſſed, Two <hi>China</hi> diſhes with Sherbet were brought forth, and given to the Two Ambaſſadors, and Two larger bowles of the ſame to their Attendants: Then the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent was brought forth, and laid before the Vizier, conſiſting of Twenty Veſts; Four of them were of fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth of ſeveral colours; Four of ſeveral coloured Velvets; Fourof ſeveral flowred Stuffs with Gold and Silver; Four of watred Tabbies, and Four of Sattins: In recompence hereof both the Ambaſſadors were veſted, with Six others, which Veſts are of no great matter of uſe, or value, more than that they are evidences and badges of the Vizier's favour. After this his Excellency with Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh</hi> aroſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, wearing theſe Veſts, until they were paſſed without the Gates of the Viziers Palace, and then they delivered them to be carried by their Servants, as the others did; and ſo his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency returned to his Houſe at <hi>Pera,</hi> with an appearance of a fair Correſpondency, and with aſſurances that the Capitulations and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be maintained, and conſerved with a ſtrict and inviolate Faith.</p>
                     <p>The day of giving pay to the Janiſaries draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near, the Ambaſſador's Audience with the Grand Signior was deferred until that time, for with that occaſion the Court would appear in the moſt ſolemn manner, and the attendance of the Soldiery would render all things more great and powerful: In the mean time the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior often took a view from his <hi>Seraglio,</hi> of the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Frigat, and frequently rowed round her in a Boat; and ſome ſay, he once came <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito</hi> aboard to ſee her; at length he was ſo pleaſed with her, that he fancied her to be a very proper Veſſel to carry Soldiers and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for <hi>Candia;</hi> but propoſing his Thoughts and intentions to the Vizier, he was diſſwaded from the demand, or conſtraint of the Ship, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed, that this was a matter unpracticable, and uncivil towards a Prince, who on confidence of Amity and Alliance with him, had adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Ship within his Port.</p>
                     <p>The Twenty ſixth day of <hi>February,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Audience with the Grand Signior.</note> being Pay-day of the Janiſaries, the Lord Ambaſſador had Audience of the Grand Signior, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in this manner. His Excellency, with Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh,</hi> departing from his Houſe, with his retinue on Horſe-back, by break of day in the Morning, was met on <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſide by the Chaous-Baſhee, and his Chaouſes, and by them conducted to the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> We rode through the firſt Court which was very ſpacious, and then we alighted from our Horſes, and walked through another Court leading to the Divan, or place of Judicature; at the upper end of which the Great Vizier was ſeated; on his right Hand ſate Five Viziers of the Bench, of which the Captain-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, or Admiral of the Seas, was one; on the left were the Two Kadileſchers or Chief Juſtices, one of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and the other of <hi>Romelia,</hi> and by them the Tefterdar Paſha or Lord Treaſurer, with Three other Paſha's: The floar of the Divan was covered with Carpets, and on them a richer covering of Bags of Money, for payment of the Janisaries. The Two Ambaſſadors with about Six or Seven of their retinue (amongſt which I was one) being admitted in, and placed at the lower end, their Excellencies approached toward the Vizier, and were ſeated near unto him on Two ſtools co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Crimſon Velvet, and ſome Diſcourſe and Complement having paſſed between them, they retired to another part of the Room, that they might give way to Buſineſs. In the mean time the payment of the Soldiers went forward, every Churbagee, or Captain, taking from the heaps, the Pay of his Soldiers, and laying the Bags on their Shoulders, made up to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, and having kiſſed the Hem of his Veſt on his Knees, he retired with great Humility and haſt from him, paſſing away with his ſide towards him, it being very unſeemly amongſt them to turn their backs to Perſonages of that Dignity.</p>
                     <p>The Payment being over, Three ſmall Tables were brought in; the firſt of which was covered with a silver Voyder, at which the Two Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors ſate with the chief Miniſters; but the Great Vizier by reaſon of his Age and Weakneſs retired into another Room. The other Two Tables were covered with a mixed Mettal, which ſerved in the place of a Table-Cloth, at which the others ſate: We had no Knives, Forks, nor Plate; but only Wooden Spoons were laid for us, which was ſufficient in that manner of eating, for their Meats are moſt boyled, and conveniently received by the Spoon; or are ſo well roaſted, that they are eaſily parted with the Fingers. The
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:39539:56"/>diſhes were ſerved in by one at a time, but ſo faſt, that we had ſcarce taſted of one, before it was ſnatched away to make place for another; and I think there might be about Twenty ſeveral changes, in this manner; at the end of all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude our Feaſt, a great Bowl of Sherbet was brought in, and we drank of it, as large draughts as we pleaſed. Being riſen from the Table, Eighteen Coftans, or Veſts, being the uſual num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber given to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour, with one extraordinary in favour to the New Ambaſſador, were brought forth, and beſtowed; and in the mean time, the Preſent from our King to the Grand Signior, provided at the expence of the <hi>Turky</hi> Company, conſiſting of Fifty Veſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Ten of Velvet, Ten of Sattin, Ten of Cloth of Gold, Ten of Tabbies, and Ten of fine <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cloth, were brought forth and diſplayed in the open Court by Fifty men which carried them, and Four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Maſtiffs, which were more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to this Grand Signoir than all the reſt. The whole body of Janiſaries then payed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about Five thouſand, were drawn up in a body, and ranged on one ſide of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; amongſt them there was that ſilence, that the leaſt whiſper, noiſe, or motion was not heard; and as their Janiſar Aga, and other Commanders paſſed, the bowings they made in ſalute were ſo regular, and at the ſame time, as may well teſtify the exactneſs of their Diſcipline, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable obedience, which hath in a great meaſure contributed towards their Conqueſts and Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Empire.</p>
                     <p>Being thus Veſted, and ranked in Order, the Great Vizier entered into the Preſence of the Grand Signior; and then Two Capugi-baſhes or Chief of the Porters of the Gate, with long Silver Staves, took the New Ambaſſador under each Arm to conduct him to the Chamber of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; thoſe permitted to accompany him were Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi>'s Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sir <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> Captain of the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Frigat, the Interpreter, and my ſelf, who then being Secretary, carried the Credential Letters made up in a Purſe of Cloth of Gold. We gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knocked at the firſt Gate, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet wide open to us, in the Porch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Forty white Eunuchs attended, clothed in Veſts of Sattin, and Cloth of Gold of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and ſtood with their Hands before them with marvellous ſilence, and modeſty. Coming near to the Preſence-door, where the Kapi-Aga or Chief of the white Eunuchs attended, we made a pauſe in the Porch, and trod very ſoftly, ſo as not to diſturb with the leaſt motion, the greatneſs of that Majeſty; and ſo profound was the ſilence, that nothing was heard beſides the murmurings of a Fountain adjoining hereunto. Juſt at the entrance of the Chamber, hung a gilded Ball ſtudded with divers precious Stones, the Floar was covered with Crimſon Velvet; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with Golden-wyre. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior himſelf ſate in a Throne raiſed a ſmall heigth from the ground, ſupported with Four Pillars plated with Gold; from the top hung ſeveral gilded Balls twined with Maſſes of Pearl; the Cuſhions he ſate upon, and thoſe alſo that lay by, were richly embroidered, and beſet with Jewels, and on his right hand ſtood the Great Vizier. And having made a conſiderable ſtop at the Door, the Two Capugibaſhees, who held his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under each Arm, brought him to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Room, and laying their Hands upon his Head, made him bow, until he touched the Carpets with his forehead; and then raiſing him again, they retired backward with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fartheſt part of the Room; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they took all the others ſingly and in order, placing them behind the Ambaſſadors. The Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Letters from our King were then preſented, and appointed that they ſhould be delivered to the hands of the <hi>Reis-Efendi,</hi> or Secretary of State.</p>
                     <p>Then the Druggerman or Interpreter, by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Lord Ambaſſador, read a Paper in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language to this Effect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Declaring how the King of Great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> our Soveraign Lord and Maſter, was reſtored to the Throne of his Anceſtors without War, or any Conditions: And the great Clemency of His Majeſty in pardoning all, but thoſe who had a hand in the Murder of his Father.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Recommending the Merchants and their Intereſt to the continuance of his uſual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Protection.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Begging the freedom of all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Slaves, as a particular Teſtimony of Favour, and Grace to this New Ambaſſador.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Ceremonies being performed, and the Paper read, we immediately departed, paſſing to our Horſes by the ſame way which we came: And being mounted, we drew up a little out of the paſſage to ſee the Soldiers march by us, which indeed appeared to be a very flouriſhing Militia of young Men, robuſt, and well clothed; many of them running with Bags of Money on their Shoulders, and all of them chearful, and glad of the charge they carried with them; after them followed their Commanders exceedingly well mounted: And laſt of all came the Great Vizier attended with many Paſhaes, and a goodly Equipage: And then his Excellency, with Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bendyſh,</hi> and attendance, proceeded forwards, and returned to their home. After this Two viſits were made: Namely, to the Captain-Paſha or Admiral of the Seas, and the other to the Muſtee; at the firſt, Six Veſts were preſented; and at the latter, Five; and both were perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and accepted with ſuch mutual kindneſs, that never did the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Miniſters caſt more ſerene countenances on the Trade and Concernments of <hi>England,</hi> than on this conjuncture.</p>
                     <p>And thus the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea</hi> being very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully, and with fignal Demonſtrations of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and a good correſpondence, ſeated in the uſual reſidence of Ambaſſadors, the Grand Signior, as a particular Note and mark of his favour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with Three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Slaves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a kind and friendly anſwer to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Letters, by Sir <hi>Thomas Bendyſh,</hi> who embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the <hi>Plimouth</hi> Frigat, and departed the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>March.</hi> And thus having given the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Relation of the State of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>Turky:</hi> Let us view and conſider the Condition of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Affairs amongſt themſelves.</p>
                     <p>At the arrival of this Ambaſſador, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affairs of this vaſt and ſtill growing Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, were governed by the Great Vizier <hi>Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlee;</hi> a Perſon decrepit and infirm in body, by reaſon of his great Age, but of a ſolid and ſubtle judgment; by Nature cruel, and by Years fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; which diſpoſition was ſingularly well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to do ſervice to his Maſter, againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous ſtorms of the Faction of thoſe times, in which the Paſhaws, and Chiefs of the Soldiery (as often it happens in Empires, whoſe Body is grown too vaſt to be ruled by a weak Head) became rich and powerful, and by the long Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Peace, inſolent and wanton; for as then the Wars with <hi>Venice</hi> were carried on faintly, only by ſending forth an Armata of Gallies in the Spring; and the preparations became rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary, returning with the Year, and made
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:39539:56"/>for exerciſe of the Arſenal, and amuſement of the People, than deſigned with any probable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of ſucceſs or Victory, proportionable to that Treaſure and Trouble which maintained them. So that to encounter ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and predominancy of Ambition and Avarice, the Prince himſelf being young, the Fortune of his Empire had more than urgent neceſſity of ſuch a rough and cruel diſpoſition as was found in <hi>Kuperlee;</hi> who ſo ſeaſonably made uſe of it, to the deſtruction of all ſuch, who might either endanger his Prince, or himſelf; that in two or three Years time he became Maſter of the Lives and Eſtates of the Grand Mutiniers; confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their richeſs and fortunes to the uſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his Maſter; having in his time put to Death thirty ſix thouſand perſons, whom he proſcribed in ſeveral Countries, and privately ſtrangled in the City, by vertue of his abſolute and uncontroulable Authority, without giving the Offenders liberty of Proceſſes, or Pleas for their Lives, or the ſolemnity of Scaffolds, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of a Funeral Oration at the Gallows, whereby to win the affections and compaſſions of the vulgar, but went through with his bloody and tragical buſineſs, without noiſe, or rumour, or knowledge almoſt of the Souldiery, or the people; whilſt the great Perſonages, whoſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and pride had contracted them envy and hatred from their inferiours, ſtood confuſed and amaſed, not having power to rebel, nor San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to fly unto.</p>
                     <p>Such is the effect of an abſolute, and arbitrary power, which is Maſter of times and affairs, and rather fits and ſquares Enterprizes to Counſels, than Counſels to Enterprizes. <hi>Reges Hercule non liberi ſolum impedimentis omnibus, ſed Domini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, temporun<expan>

The Grand Signior in the mean time applauded the diligence and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of his Miniſter; and though yet trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with the memory of late ſollevations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Janizaries; yet being young, and active, addicted himſelf wholly to the delight of Hunting, and to follow the Chace of fearful, and flying Beaſts; whilſt his Vizier ſo cloſely fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his game of Bloud, that he left no Perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the Empire, who was not a Creature made by, or depending on him; unleſs the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyabei, or Lieutenant General of the Janizaries; <hi>Mortaza</hi> Paſha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> now called by the <hi>Turks Bagdat,</hi> and the Paſha of <hi>Magnaſia;</hi> Men, whoſe bravery, and generous Juſtice, or elſe their Guards, or Fortune, had only ſeated beyond the reach and Sword of this Tyrant. This was then the State of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Affairs amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; As to Foreign, and Chriſtian Princes; the Emperor, the King of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> had their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors and Reſidents at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, with whom as yet paſſed a fair and amicable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, excepting with the <hi>French;</hi> whoſe Embaſſadour had then lately obtained his releaſe from Impriſonment, to which he was confined contrary to the Law of Nations, and the Cuſtom of the wiſeſt, and moſt generous People of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; and compelled to return into <hi>France;</hi> an Agent being there ſetled by the Merchants, to Negotiate their Affairs; the occaſions and grounds whereof we have at large ſignified in another place: which unlawful treatment of a Perſon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, none will much admire, who conſiders the humour of ſupream Miniſters that judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under no reſtraint or limits of Law, either Civil, or National.</p>
                     <p>This Embaſſador from <hi>France</hi> was call'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>le Haye,</hi> the Father, a Perſon excellently well qualifi'd, having with ſucceſs paſs'd in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity for the ſpace of 25 years until ſome miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings paſſing between him, and this Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Vizier, he ſuffered many indignities from him, which being added to the extream torment of the Stone, under which he laboured, made him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on any terms to return to his own Countrey.</p>

No Meſſage could arrive more grateful to ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> who by ſo deſired a proffer, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to arrive to the Zenith of his Proſeperity; which like the Land of Promiſe, being only ſhewed to his Father in a long Proſpective, ſeemed now as it were, by Inheritance, to devolve upon his Son; in order unto which, many days of Treaty and Conferences were held between <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> and the Poliſh Miniſters;<note place="margin">

This <hi>Ragotski</hi> enjoyed a State moſt happy, large, fertile, and populous, in Power inferior to few, ſuperior to many; ſo that he might have paſſed peaceably and honourably with all, could his great ſpirit have bowed to, and complied with his Potent Neighbours.<note place="margin">The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of <hi>Ragotski</hi>'s Affairs.</note> For on the one ſide the Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant power of the <hi>Turk</hi> threatned him, to whom the leaſt Ombrages of diſpleaſure adminiſter oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of War; On the ſide of <hi>Hungary</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour over-awed him: On the ſide of <hi>Valachia,</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> he lay open to the incurſion of the <hi>Tartars.</hi> So that a man might rationally expect, That this Prince ſhould have eſteemed it honour enough to have conſerved his own without ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring himſelf obnoxious to the jealouſie and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of his Neighbours.

                     <p>But how vain and deceitful are humane hopes, whoſe foundations are Ambition and Violence! For <hi>Leopold</hi> ſucceeding in the place of his Father to <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Empire, immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the deſign in favour of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in the firſt place beſieging <hi>Turone,</hi> one of the chief Cities of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> taken by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> forced it to a Surrender.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ragotski</hi> perceiving the face of things thus changed, and being by Command of the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Port abandoned by his Moldavian and Wala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian Forces, began to turn his face towards <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania,</hi> where now he wiſhed himſelf and Army lodged in ſafety.

Nor did theſe misfortunes end here; but the <hi>Tartars</hi> commanded by the <hi>Turks,</hi> in revenge and chaſtiſement of <hi>Ragotski</hi>'s Enterprize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their conſent, entered into his Principality with conſiderable Bodies of Horſe, againſt whoſe ſudden Invaſion, an Army under the Conduct of his General <hi>Kemenius</hi> could not be ſo ſoon colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and diſciplined, as to be able to reſiſt that fury of <hi>Tartars,</hi> who at their pleaſure burned the Towns and Villages, and carried away mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of people of both Sexes, and all Ages for Captives into their own Country, amongſt which ſome were of Quality and Condition.

                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe Extravagancies ſo exaſperated the minds of the <hi>Turks,</hi> that whereas before they began to entertain tender thoughts towards <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> they now meditated its entire Ruin and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and ſo laying aſide Arguments and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, they made Levies of Horſe and Foot both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.

                     <p>In the Tranſaction of all theſe Paſſages, <hi>July</hi> was well entered, when both Armies met in open Field; and tho the Forces of the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> were much inferior to thoſe of the <hi>Turk,</hi> yet <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotzki</hi> full of his wonted Courage and Heat, ſo vigorouſly aſſailed the Enemy, that he quickly broke and diſordered their Ranks, put them to flight, and killed three thouſand upon the place. But little did this advantage benefit poor <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> for the Great Vizier ſoon after following with the groſs of his Army, conſiſting of little leſs than an 100. thouſand Men, provided accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with Artillery, and all other Military Ammunition; ſeconded by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by the <hi>Moldavians</hi> and <hi>Valachians,</hi> and a Rout of other barbarous Nations; laid Seige to the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Janoua;</hi>

The Nobles of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> ſenſible of theſe imminent and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Miſchiefs, diſpeeded three Perſons of conſiderable Quality amongſt them, in an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to the Vizier; viz. <hi>Francis Daniel, John Lues,</hi> and <hi>Acatius Berclay,</hi> who greatly laboured by their Oratory to perſwade the Vizier, that they were in no wiſe conſenting to the diſobedience of their Prince, but did always readily ſubmit to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Servitude; imploring his Clemency and Commiſeration of their diſtreſſed and ruined State. The Vizier inclining his Ear to their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſtopped the Progreſs of his Arms, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their Tribute to ſuch an exceſſive rate, that the burden of it became inſupportable, and appointed <hi>Berclay,</hi> one of the Embaſſadors,<note place="margin">

It is uncertain whether <hi>Berclay</hi> deſigned the Principality to himſelf by any inſtance he made to the <hi>Turks,</hi> or whether his Election proceeded meerly from the Vizier himſelf; yet this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that returning home, <hi>Berclay</hi> applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to eſtabliſh his own Dominion, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint the deſigns of his Predeceſſor, and his party.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> being ſatisfied with this Submiſſion, with the Subjection of ſeveral places of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with depoſing of <hi>Ragotzki,</hi> and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a new Prince, began to disband a great part of their Forces; and the Great Vizier, with the remainder, returned towards <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> ſuppoſing the Fire of this War to be totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</p>

The <hi>Turks</hi> immediately touched with the Senſe hereof, Iſſued out Orders to <hi>Ciddi Ahmet,</hi> the new Paſha of <hi>Buda;</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him without delay, to gather what Forces he could to interrupt the deſigns of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania;</hi> and to put matters unto a ſtand, until a greater Army could ſecond him, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, appointed General for this Expedition.

                        <hi>Varadin</hi> therefore is ſeated in a Plain, on the Banks of the River <hi>Chryſe;</hi> to the Eaſt it is envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with ſuch craggy and rough Mountains, as render it almoſt on that ſide unacceſſible; to the South the Town extended it ſelf moſt; to the North it is waſhed with the River, over which ſome ſmall, yet fruitful, Hills raiſe themſelves; it is encompaſſed with a Wall filled with Earth, after the faſhion of Modern Fortifications, and ſtrengthened with five main Bulwarks, and a very deep Ditch filled with the River Water: It was well provided both of Victuals and Ammunition, and armed with Ordnance both great and ſmall, as was ſufficient to have repulſed a puiſſant Enemy, &amp; have ſuſtain'd a long &amp; ſtrait Siege. But the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon within conſiſted only of 850 Soldiers, an inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number, both in reſpect of the Circuit of the Fortreſs, &amp; of that groſs Army which encompaſs'd it.</p>
                     <p>The Enemy being now, as it is ſaid before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Counterſcarp of the Wall, they perceived that the Ditch was ſo deep, and filled with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that though their great Guns had made open Breaches in the Walls, yet there was no poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to ſtorm them, or bring the Soldiery to ſcaling Ladders, or handy blows. The beſieged alſo made ſuch continued Sallies, with ſucceſs and ſlaughter of the Enemy, that after Three and Twenty days of vain labour to few the Ditch, <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha was at length almoſt reſolved to have raiſed his Siege, and given over the Enterprize; upon which whilſt he conſidered and ruminated (as ill Fortune would have it) a certain Maid, which formerly had been a ſervant to the Governour of the Gariſon, then a Captive in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, having obſerved how on occaſion the Citizens uſed to empty and drain the Ditch, revealed the ſecret to the <hi>Turks,</hi> hoping thereby not only to purchaſe her Liberty,<note place="margin">Two ill accidents to the Gariſon.</note> but with that alſo a Sum of Money for price of her Treachery; ſo that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering where another Ditch was to be opened, the courſe of the Water was ſoon diverted, and the Walls of the Town laid dry and open to the Aſſailants. As this happened without, ſo another accident within, equally dangerous, befel the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; for one day an Officer of the Ammunition going into the Stores with a lighted Candle, by chance dropped a ſpark of fire from his Lanthorn into the Powder, which taking fire, blew up the Powder, Granadoes, Fire-works, and all other military Stores, with the neighbouring houſes, and above a hundred men; which loſs alone was ſufficient to have dejected the minds of frail men; yet they ſo valiantly bore up their courages, that they ſeemed not in the leaſt abated, but rather animated with the height of anger and deſpair. The <hi>Turks</hi> having now free acceſs to the Walls, undermined ſome ſmall Forts, which they blew up, and thereby made ſo great a Breach, that with facility hoping to gain the Town, if they made uſe of the occaſion, they poured in ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People as the Beſieged were ſcarce able to withſtand; and the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Soldiery being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo weary of their ſufferings, and irkſomneſs of their tedious leagure, reſolved now or never to put an end to their labours; ſo that advancing with their open Breaſts to the top of the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without fear either of Cannon, or Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, they entered within the Walls, and planted the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Banners on the Works; but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards received by a reſolute Company of the Defendants, they were again thrown from the Walls, and tumbled back into the Ditch with an incredible Slaughter. It is impoſſible here to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the anger, the courage, the deſpair which was apparent in the faces of the Beſieged, enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the love of their own country, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the <hi>Turks;</hi> ſo that three or four ſuſtained ſometimes the Aſſault of a Troop; and a ſmall number united, oppoſed a whole Sangiack of the Enemy. The Women alſo forgetting the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity of their Sex, renewing in themſelves the Courage and Vigour of the Ancient Amazons, expoſed themſelves without fear upon the Walls, throwing ſcalding Water, Stones, burning Pitch, and whatſoever came next to hand, upon the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants; whom they ſo valiantly repulſed from the riſing of the Sun till twelve at Noon, that after much ſlaughter on both ſides, the <hi>Turks</hi> growing faint, retreated, and took breath a while within their Trenches. And now the Soldiery conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Obſtinacy of the Chriſtians, began to mutiny, and reſolving not to caſt away their lives in vain, motioned to raiſe the Siege, and be gone; which when the General oppoſed, they threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſacrifice his Life to the Ghoſts of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Brethren. But ſee, how many times the Devil ruines the fortune of the Chriſtians! for whilſt they were in this deliberation to depart, behold, a certain, <hi>Thracian</hi> one of the Gariſon Soldiers, advis'd the <hi>Turks</hi> that there were not above Three hundred found Men remaining in the whole Gariſon,<note place="margin">A <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the weakneſs of the Town.</note> that they were now reduced to their ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <hi>Criſis;</hi> ſo that if they appear'd only before them, and would but terrifie them with another aſſault, the Town was their own, without the leaſt doubt of Surrender. This advice retarded the haſty depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Camp; inſtead of which they again mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd themſelves before the Walls, and prepar'd to aſſault the Breach, reſolving to put all to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond extremity. The Chriſtians within percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſolution of their Enemy, and being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how much they were infeebled by the laſt Convulſion, and loſs of blood, and as yet ſore of their wounds, immediately ſpread a white Flag of Treaty, which was as readily accepted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and all Articles agreed on the <hi>17th.</hi>

                        <hi>Ali</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> General perceiving the ſtrength and reſolution of the Chriſtians, thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for a while to detract from Engagement, and temper the uſual mettle of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> fury with cooler Counſels of advantage, which delays and opportunities of time would adminiſter: for obſerving that the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> were divided into Factions, he humoured the diſſenting party,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</note> by conſtituting <hi>Michael Apafi</hi> their Prince; a perſon in the flower and ſtrength of his Age, of great parts and abilities; and one who violently

In this manner <hi>Apafi</hi> paſſing from his Priſon and Chains, to the glory and trouble of a Throne, poor <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> remained divided, and taking Arms againſt her ſelf, went daily working and contriving her own ruine.

                     <p>The time of this great Mortality was no ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for us to move in buſineſs or action, we and all other Chriſtians avoiding common converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, every one conſulting his particular ſafety. Howſoever two buſineſſes brought our Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to Town from his Country Retirement. One was to obtain juſtice from the Vizier, on two miſcreant <hi>Turks</hi> who had committed a Robbery on his Page and Steward, as they were drinking at a Fountain near a place called <hi>Bauchaſarai,</hi> a Village inhabited by <hi>Greeks;</hi> the Steward by the ſwiftneſs of his Horſe eſcaped, but the Page being ſickly and weak fell into their hands, and was grievouſly wounded by them.<note place="margin">The G. Viziers ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.</note> Complaints hereof being made to the Grand Vizier, he ſeemed much concerned at the evil treatment of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors ſervants; and therefore ſent the Nayp of the Kadi of <hi>Galata</hi> to take notice, and write down the Wounds which the Page had received; and at the ſame time diſpatched Officers into all parts adjacent, to take the Thieves, and to examine, and torment the people in places where it might be ſuſpected only that they were harboured, and that nothing ſhould be neglected in order to this diſcovery. It is incredible with what diligence, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and violence this command was executed, the people in the Villages where they had lodged or been, or but paſſed through, were all ſeized; and the men examined under the Cudgel, with Drubs on their feet; the men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Baucha-ſarai</hi> were carried, and ſome of them in Chains, to our Ambaſſadors Houſe at <hi>Pera;</hi> and all the Countries round were ſo ill treated, that their common ſafety was concerned in the taking of theſe Thieves, and the allarum was by this time ſo far ſpread, that it was more preſſing and urgent than our <hi>Hue-and-Cry;</hi> in ſhort, one of the Thieves was taken, and he diſcovered the abode of his Companion, and both were brought to our Ambaſſadors Houſe, and there put into the Stocks, laden with Chains, and guarded by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers. The next day they were carried before the <hi>Stambol-Efendi,</hi> or Recorder of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> they confeſſed the fact, and Hoget or Sentence paſſed upon them, which by Law could reach no farther than to the Gallies; but being brought before the Vizier, he had a mind to ſtretch the Law, and their necks to a farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſo without other demur calling the Hang man, ordered him to put Ropes about their necks, and to carry them to the Lord Ambaſſador, following his directions for their execution; and ſo accordingly one was hanged by the Fountain, and the other on a Tree at the entrance into the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Bauche-ſarai.</hi> This Exemplary juſtice raiſed the reverence, and fear of the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people towards our Ambaſſador unto that degree, that during the time of the Earl of <hi>Winchilſea,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature ever paſſed again, but on the contrary, the Paiſants, and the people in the Countries round, honoured and feared him like one of their Paſha's, or great men.</p>
                     <p>The other buſineſs was of a different nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Emin, or Cuſtomer of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> who being diſmiſſed of his Employment was now come to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> before his departure from <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he had demanded of our Merchants there 16000 Dollars for Arrears of Cuſtom due to him, on Silk and other Goods; his pretence was falſe and unjuſt, howſoever it being uſual for <hi>Turks</hi> upon every demand to gain an advantage, the matter was compounded with the Sum of 2500 Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſo the Cuſtomer departed with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of perfect ſatisfactation; notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which coming to <hi>Constantinople</hi> he renewed his pretenſions again, and by the favour of the <hi>Reis-Efendi</hi> or Secretary of State, ſo proceeded in his buſineſs, that the Lord Ambaſſador was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make a ſecond compoſition with 2000 Dollars.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior and Vizier, as we ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being now at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> the Viziers Deputy, called by the name of the <hi>Caimacam,</hi> governed <hi>Constantinople,</hi> to whom our Ambaſſador, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to cuſtom made a viſit, preſenting him with eight Veſts.</p>
                     <p>Likewiſe in abſence of the Vizier, it being uſual for the Ambaſſador to make a Viſit to the <hi>Boſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee-Baſhee,</hi> or Head of the Gardiners; his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency paſſed that Complement on him, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with four Veſts. This perſon though entitled Head-Gardiner, is yet of great power, making a conſiderable figure at Court; for he not only commands all the Gardiners belonging to the many <hi>Seraglio</hi>'s of the Grand Signior, which are very conſiderable in number, but his Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction reaches all along the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Villages, Woods and Countries at a far diſtance, ſo that he may in <hi>Engliſh</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to the chief Ranger.</p>

The old Man acknowledged the favour with all humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and thankfulneſs, declaring, that he had now ſerved his Majeſty faithfully for the ſpace of five years, a longer proportion than commonly Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers had managed that Office, in ſuch tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous and diſtracted times, who either for their own offences, or want of Providence, or good Conduct, have made ſhipwrack of their own lives, and the Charge they pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loted: But he had lived in the worſt of times, when the ſpirits of men with diſcontent were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed round about him, and threatned the ruine of their Prince and Empire; and yet had reduced things to compoſure, and to the obedience of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoke, that now he that was the Sultan might incline his Head to reſt with ſecurity, and enjoy his paſtimes and pleaſures, without being interrupted by thoſe Conſpiracies, which deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Father, and endangered him in his years of Infancy. And becauſe the continuance of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Glory depended on the execution of certain Maximes, which he had framed to himſelf, he was chalking out to his Son ſuch undoubted Rules and Doctrines of Government, as would certainly tend to the glory and proſperity of the Empire, being abundantly ſatisfied that his Son was faithful, prudent, and active.

In like manner the <hi>Kayah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begh,</hi> an ancient, prudent, and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, beloved by the Soldiery, and ſecured by the Priviledge of his Office, (for a <hi>Kayah-begh</hi> cannot be cut off during his Command, without infringement of the honour and order of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries) preſerved ſtill his Station, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in deſpight of the Viziers hate and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours.

                     <p>During the Tranſaction of theſe affairs in divers parts, the Wars againſt the <hi>Venetians</hi> were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on faintly; the Gallies had no other deſign, or employment, than to tranſport recruits of Men and Ammunition to <hi>Canea,</hi> that ſo the <hi>Turks</hi> might rather keep the ground that they had gained in that Iſland, than add thereunto by new Conqueſts, until ſuch time as that being freed from other Wars, they might have leiſure and opportunity to attend unto that alone.

                     <p>AT the beginning of this Year the People of <hi>Algier</hi> ſent Meſſengers and Preſents to the Grand signiors Court, then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining againſt the Actions His Majeſties Fleet, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Earl of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> had done againſt their Town and Caſtles, pretending thoſe Forts to be the Grand Signiors, and the Affront offered to him, as willing to intereſt him in thier Quarrels and Piracies. And that thier Addreſſes might be more graciouſly received, they brought with them certain Preſents, which tho in former time swere Yearly, were now only as their Affairs required, and on this occaſion were doubled: for beſides their Preſents to the Miniſters and Officers of State; they brought to the Grand Signior a Ship made in Silver, beſet with Emrods, Rubies, and other Stones; fourteen young and hanſom Boys, and a neger Eunuch for the <hi>Seraglio.</hi> But the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> His Majeſties Embaſſador there Reſident, being then at Court, had ſo well prepoſſeſſed the Vizier with the Ground and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the War, that the complaints of <hi>Algier</hi> were judged in no wiſe touching the <hi>Ottoman</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or the breach of Peace, any Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the good Correſpondence and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which then intervened between the King of <hi>England</hi> and the Grand Signior. But their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to ſearch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and take out Strangers Goods, was objected as an Argument of their Diſobedience and Rebellion, contrary to the Grand Signiors Capitulations, which alſo was aggravated by their ill Treatment of the Grand Signiors Paſha, whom they had beaten, impriſoned, and caſt out of all Power and Authority; which ſevere Reprehenſions ſo terrified and diſcouraged them, that they not only deſiſted from their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but began to fear, leſt the Power and Intereſt of the Ambaſſador at Court, ſhould contrive ſome miſchief to their own Perſons.</p>
                     <p>Soon after this the Vizier eſteeming it neceſſary towards his better eſtabliſhment to gratifie the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

Howſoever the Vizier had ſo far entered into his Affection and Eſteem, that his Perſwaſions were ſtronger than his own abſolute Dominion; and prevailed ſo with him againſt the force of his own Fancy, that about the Equinoctial he began his Journey
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:39539:62"/>towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the great Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of his People: But by the way lingring out his time in Hunting and other Paſtimes of the Woods and Fields; it was the <hi>30th</hi> of <hi>March</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made his Entry, for never was Prince ſo great a <hi>Nimrod,</hi> ſo unwearied a Huntſman as this; never was he at quiet, but continually in the Fields on Horſeback, riſing ſometimes at Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, to ride up the Mountains, that he might more early diſcover the Sun in the Morning; by which extravagant courſe of Life, he wearied out his Court and Attendants, who began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the amorous humour of the Father more ſupportable, than the wandring Vagaries, and reſtleſs Spirit of the Son.<note place="margin">The Gr.

                     <p>The Vizier being thus weakned by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of his faithfulleſt Friend, his Condition was given over as deſperate by the generality of the World, and ſeveral appearances of Troubles ariſing from the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Weſtern</hi> parts, gave occaſion to the Queen Mother, and her Party, to diſparage his Abilities in the eſteem of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan: Wherefore they exhorted him to imitate the Example of his Renowned Predeceſſors, who made uſe of their Viziers only to eaſe them from the troubleſom part of their Government, but did not entirely throw off the Knowledg and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the important Tranſactions and State Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the whole Empire. This Leſſon awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Grand Signior a little, ſo that he declined ſome days his Sports abroad, and Exerciſe on Horſe-back, and inſtead thereof paſſed much of his time in a <hi>Chiosk,</hi> or Garden-houſe on the Wall of the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> juſt oppoſite to the Viziers Gate, where his chief Buſineſs and Concernment was to obſerve ſuch as went in, or came out; and when at any time he eſpied thoſe enter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for their Attendance, or difference of Habit, he would ſend to know of the Vizier, what occaſion drew thoſe People thither, what their Buſineſs was, and the like, by which he gave himſelf that Satisfaction as to believe that he had now found the true way of inſpecting his Affairs, and taking care of his Empire.<note place="margin">The Queen Mothers Enmity to the Vizier.</note> The Vizier was not inſenſible from whence this humour of the Gr.

                        <note place="margin">That is, of the <hi>Hazo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> or Royal Chamber.</note> inſtigated by the Queen Mother to diminiſh ſomething the Power of the Vizier, put often the Grand Signior in mind, as a matter agreeable to his Dignity, to have a regard to his Government, which cauſed him more frequently than his humour ſerved, to betake himſelf to his <hi>Choisk</hi> over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Viziers Gate, to make his uſual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and perceiving ſome Chriſtians to enter the Court with red Calpacks or Caps, and yellow Shooes (prohibited to Chriſtians by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of inferior Magiſtrates, but never until now thought worthy the Imperal Obſervance) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately called for the Subaſhee or Conſtable of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and from the Window command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with great Fury to enter the Viziers Court, and ſuch Chriſtians as he ſhould find there with yellow Shooes and red Caps he ſhould firſt beat, and then ſend uncovered and barefooted home. The Subaſhee armed with a Power in this matter as high as the Viziers, entered the Houſe without Complement or Licence, and encountring firſt the <hi>Kapikahya</hi>'s or Agents of <hi>Moldavia</hi> and <hi>Valachia</hi> negotiating the Affairs of their Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he rudely layed them down, and without Reſpect to their Perſons or Office, beat them on the Feet, tore off their red Stockins and Caps, and ſent them home with their Heads and Feet bare, derided by the People,<note place="margin">The Gr. Signiors ſevere Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhoes, and red Calpacks to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> and lamenting the Affliction of that Tyranny to which they were ſubjected. This inhumane Treatment of Perſons in a manner ſacred, was ſeconded by publick Proclamations, ſtrictly prohibiting all Chriſtians from wearing red Caps, yellow Shooes, ſcarlet Veſts, and the like; and <hi>Janizaries</hi> from the uſe of Hanjars or Daggers, and ſilk Turbants, upon pain of Death; which Order was ſo ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, that the Corners of every Street were furniſhed with Officers to obſerve, and puniſh ſuch as were found to offend. The Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Rimſelf judged alſo the Execution of this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that importance, as to deſerve his own proper Care and Inſpection; wherefore walking abroad, as his manner was, in diſguiſe, with his Executione at hand, encountred in the Streets an unfortunate Bridegroom, an Armenian, who that day, on priviledge of his Eſpouſals, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to dreſs himſelf with yellow leathern Soks: nothing was, or could have time to be pleaded in his behalf, before the fatal Blow was ſtruck, which ſent him to his Grave inſtead of his Nupital Bed. This fury continued ſome few days with much rigour, and ſtrict obſervation, but afterwards growing cold again, all care was neglected, happening herein, as commonly it doth in all things, which have no other foundation than humour and fancy.</p>
                     <p>But this inſpection into petty matters did not ſo much diſturb the thoughts of the Vizier, as did the power and greatneſs of <hi>Mortaza</hi> the Paſha of <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Turks called <hi>Bagdat,</hi> a perſon of an undaunted Courage, and greate Conduct, whom he had hitherto ſuffered to live, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the true knowledge of his intereſt, and the Rules his Father had left him: wherefore he reſolved to renew his deſign and attempts againſt his Life, one I remember was in <hi>December</hi> of the paſt Year, when in our Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> we met a Meſſenger on the way, who amongſt other Diſcourſes informed us, that he was then going to <hi>Bablyon</hi> for confirmation of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> and as a teſtimony of the G. Signiors favour and good will towards him, he carried him a Sword, and a Veſt of Sables: we immediatly, and that truly, gueſſed for what Preſent the Sword was ſent; for in ſome Months after the Chaous-baſhee, or chief of the Purſuivants, returned without delivery of his Preſent.<note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier ſeeks to cut of <hi>Mortaza</hi> the Paſha of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                        </note> For the wiſe <hi>Mortaza</hi> was ſo juſtly Jealous, that he would not ſo much as admit him to his Preſence, but returned him again with his Sword and Sables for thoſe who were more eaſy and credulous, and who believe to dye by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Sultan to be Martyrdom, and the only Crown of all their Merits and Deſerts: and knowing that he could not long ſubſiſt in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to ſo great an Enemy; he contracted an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance by Marriage with a Daughter of one of the <hi>Gordean,</hi> or <hi>Curdean</hi> Princes, and in Dowry had one of the ſtrongeſt Forts of thoſe Mountains delivered into his hands.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier finding himſelf thus foiled in his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Artifices, began publickly to profeſs his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and therefore in the firſt place perſwaded the Grand Signior, that the long continuance of <hi>Mortaza</hi> in that Government, beyond the uſual term, ſo Opulent and Powerful, and of a Spirit ſo Ambitions and Rebellious, could not but prove dangerous to himſelf, and in time give him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Competition for the whole Empire; which hazard to prevent with moſt prudence and advantage, (there being a preſent occaſion of good Soldiers for relief of <hi>Candia</hi>) <hi>Mortaza</hi> and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:39539:63"/>his Complices could not be better beſtowed than upon that Employment. The Grand Signior readily conſented to his Counſel, being naturally very apprehenſive of Danger, and in his place conſtituted the <hi>Aga,</hi> or General of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> poſting him away with all ſpeed-poſſible to his Government; who did not run ſo faſt in his Journey, but that the advices of the coming of a new Paſha, arrived timely the Ears of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who judging it an unequal match to contend with the whole Empire, gave way to his Succeſſor, but withal, kept himſelf ſo on his Guard, that his Adverſary could not reach his Head, and ſend it as the firſt-fruits and Tribute of his new Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. For yielding up his command as in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner of Retreat, he gave out, that with his Army (reported to conſiſt of Forty thouſand Men) he was on his March to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> but ſoon after his deſign was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be otherwiſe; for believing his own Force unable to contend with his Maſters, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired with his richeſs, and ſome of thoſe moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to him, unto his Fort on the Mountains, and to the Protection and Country of the King of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> whoſe Daughter he had Married, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in Epectation of time and opportunity, to take his revenge on the Vizier, hoping that with time this ſtorm would blow over, and that the Beams of his Princes Favour would again ſhine upon him.<note place="margin">Curdi.</note> Theſe <hi>Curdi</hi> are called by ſome Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>Cordiaei,</hi> from whence the Province had the name of <hi>Gordiene,</hi> bordering on <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom once of <hi>Zabienus,</hi> who ſiding with <hi>Lucullus</hi> againſt <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> was by <hi>Tigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> murdered with his Wife and Children. Theſe People inhabit the Mountain <hi>Amanus,</hi> dividing <hi>Syria</hi> from <hi>Cilicia,</hi> which by reaſon of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult acceſs thereunto, was never yet ſubjected to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoke; they are ſaid in former times to have worſhipped a black Dog, and dare not ſpeak ill of the Devil, not for love, but fear. But ſome report, that have lately been amongſt them, that they have left off that helliſh Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and embrace a certain ſort of Religion mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Chriſtianity and Turciſm; but yet without Baptiſm or Circumciſion. In brief, they are a bad ſort of groſs People at the beſt, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with little Religion, addicted to Blood and Robberies. Theſe <hi>Curdi</hi> or <hi>Gordeenes,</hi> being a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple retired, keep within their Mountains, are ſhy in their Converſation and Diſcourſe, and afford us little ſubject, or opportunity of knowing with any Satisfaction, their Religion or Manners; but from ſuch of our Country-men, as have lately entertained Society with them, we have this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. They are ſeated on thoſe Mountains, as we have ſaid before, which of old are called <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaei</hi> or <hi>Gordiai,</hi> beginning near <hi>Aleppo,</hi> but run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out as far as <hi>Perſia;</hi> they make ſhew of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion for fear, but have in reality ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their own, which permits them to eat Swines Fleſh, and drink Wine, as the <hi>Druſes</hi> and <hi>Kalbeenes;</hi> Bacon being eſteemed by them a particular Cordial, or Reſtorative for the Sick. The chief Country and City of thoſe near <hi>Aleppo,</hi> is called <hi>Jeumee,</hi> where they have a Convent of twelve Prieſts with a Superior over them, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the like ſort near <hi>Moſul</hi> or <hi>Nineveth.</hi> The two Chiefs of theſe Monaſteries meet at fixed times to conſult for the good of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal. Their Devotions are private in a Cave; they tell us of but one Book, which contains both their Law and their Rituals; being asked what they thought of our Saviour, they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he was their Breath, and their Soul; at the name of <hi>Mahomet</hi> they Spit, and with <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his Circumſpection and Aſſurance of Secrecy, they declared, themſelves and Chriſtians the ſame, which they would make appear ſo ſoon as they were delivered from their fear of Bondage to the <hi>Turk.</hi> They ſay that they worſhip God, and will not curſe the Devil, to which no Force or Power can compel them partly, perhaps becauſe they have heard of our Saviours Precept, <hi>Bleſs, and Curſe not,</hi> but rather, becauſe they hold, that the Devil and his Followers ſhall one day be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their former ſeats of Bleſſedneſs and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. When their Prieſts are together, and Wine brought in amongſt them, the Superior makes a ſign for Silence, and afterwards a ſhort Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Wine is the Blood of God. I have heard that a <hi>Capuchin</hi> Fryer was once invited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, with Promiſe to give him a ſight of their Book of Rituals, and being come to <hi>Jeumee,</hi> was detained a day or two in a Cave, on pretence that the other Superior of <hi>Moſul</hi> was then amongſt them, who being a ſevere Perſon, if he knew of his being there, would certainly put him to Death, as one who came to alter their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; upon which Suſpicion the <hi>Capuchin</hi> forgetting his Curioſity, fled for ſafety, with all ſpeed poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Their Prieſts are ſaid to be Grave, wearing black throughout; their Garments plaited or quilted; the Veſtures of the Commonalty are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to Mountainiers, whoſe Natures are Rough and Boiſterous, addicted to Blood and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, the common Vice of thoſe People. I have heard, that the Son of a <hi>Gourdeene</hi> Widow being killed by ſome of that Country, She aſſembled her neareſt Kindred, and required them to bring her the Windpipe of the Murderer, which when they had done, She together with her Friends, eat in it Revenge. In fine, their Religion may have ſome ſmall Reliques of Chriſtianity, but mixt with the dregs of other Religions. 'Tis poſſible they may be of the <hi>Manichee</hi> Race. Their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Devils Reſtoration, was once held in part by <hi>Origen:</hi> that of Wine (that it is the Blood of God) was the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> conceit of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Prieſts. Their whole Nation, if well united, may compoſe an Army of thirty or forty thouſand Men.</p>
                     <p>But to return to our purpoſe. The news of the Flight of <hi>Mortaza</hi> to this Ignoble Prince, troubled the Grand Signior, who ſtill retained ſome Impreſſions of kindneſs to his Perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Generoſity, Valour, and former Deſerts, the memory of which was encreaſed alſo by the Friends of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who wanted not in the Court to repreſent them with ſome Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, arguing that his flight was not of Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Contempt to his Maſters Protection, but an effect of natural Preſervation; which worked ſo far on the Grand Signior, that he immediately ſent for the Vizier to enquire of him the State and Condition of <hi>Mortaza.</hi> The Vizier to defend himſelf, and make good what before he had counſelled his Maſter, aggravated his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's Crimes, and his Diſobedience and Flight to an inconſiderable King; with which, and ſome other light Excuſes and Perſwaſions, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of ſuch a Perſon was agreeable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Affairs, and conducing to his own Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, eaſily pacified the Mind and Affections of the Grand Signior; but no ſooner was he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Houſe, but advice was given him, that the <hi>Emaum</hi> of <hi>Mortaza,</hi> or his Prieſt or Chaplain, was then at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom the Vizier im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly ſent for, and without any Plea or Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtruck off his Head, and threw his Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to the Sea, on pretence that he was ſent thither, as a Spy for his Maſter, and to give Intelligence, and a
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:39539:63"/>beginning to Rebellion: Theſe were his colours and allegations for his deſerved Death; for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours though never ſo wicked and ſo abſolute, and that have no need to render any other cauſe to the World of their actions, than their own will, yet eſteem it neceſſary to act under the ſpecious guiſe of juſtice, and in the good opinion of the multitude. The Aga of <hi>Babylon</hi> encountred the ſame Fortune; for <hi>Mortaza</hi> giving place, he thought it fit for himſelf to do the like; reſolving for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but being intercepted in his Journey by the new Paſha, his Head was ſtruck off, and his Journey ſhortned.</p>
                     <p>But that which again renewed the trouble and fears of the Vizier, was a report that the late <hi>Kahya-begh</hi> degraded at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was ſecretly returned to the City, and lived concealed, giving ſuch Orders to the Janizaries as tended to Mutiny and Inſurrection, and that the pretences and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of his being gone to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and thence in his holy Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> were but all falſe ſtories to conceal his Reſidence at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi> This ſet the Vizier all on fire, and made him tremble with the thoughts of it; wherefore ſearch was made for him day and night, but not found; for in reality he as gone on his deſigned Journey, only it was the misfortune of his Kahya, or Steward, as before it was of <hi>Mortaza</hi>'s Emaum, to fall into the Viziers hands, who being beaten to confeſs where his Maſter was, died afterwards of the blows.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding that <hi>Mortaza</hi> was fled, yet the Vizier laid not aſide his fears and thoughts concerning him, not knowing how ſoon he might be recalled home, and ſeated in his place; of which various Examples are extant in <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory; and therefore he ſent orders to <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha, his late Kahya, now Paſha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral (with the knowledge and conſent of the Grand Signior) and to the Paſhaws of <hi>Aleppo, Erzirum</hi> and others near adjacent, to prepare and aſſemble what Force was neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the King of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> to ſurrender <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> into their hands: But whilſt theſe matters were in agitation, ſome unexpected troubles in <hi>Georgia</hi> diverted their Arms, and held them for ſome time in ſuſpenſe, not knowing what the iſſue might be. The Original and Ground thereof was this:<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Georgia</hi> in diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</note> After <hi>Sultan Solyman</hi> had taken <hi>Erzirum,</hi> it was agreed in the Capitulations between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> that of the ſeven Provinces of <hi>Georgia</hi> (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently called <hi>Iberia,</hi> but now as ſuppoſed to have received the Denomination from St. <hi>George,</hi> the Cappadocian Martyr, there had in great eſteem and reverence) three ſhould be tributaries to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and three to the <hi>Perſian,</hi> all govern'd by <hi>Achic-baſh</hi> as head and ſupream Prince, to whom the Seventh ſhould alſo be ſubjeſted, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment to either; in payment of which Tribute, they continued moſt willingly, leſt for default thereof, the importation of Salt, of which their Provinces afford none, ſhould I be hindred either from the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> or <hi>Perſian</hi> Dominion. And now it happened that <hi>Achic-baſh</hi> dying, his Wife married again, who to gratifie her new Lover, was contented to have the eyes of her Son put out, who was the lawful Heir to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Fact was ſo hainouſly received by the Princes of the three Provinces under the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> that with common conſent, they elected one to ſucceed <hi>Achic-baſh,</hi> and extorted the power out of the hands of the Amorous Traitor. The Princes of the three Provinces under the <hi>Turk</hi> alarm'd hereat, made inſurrection, reſolving rather than any Foreigner, to ſet up one of the Kindred of <hi>Achic-baſh,</hi> which the <hi>Perſian</hi> Provinces better underſtanding, approved likewiſe, and for confirmation, and maintenance of their choice, aſſembled an Army of Threeſcore thouſand men. The Paſhaws tending towards <hi>Curdi,</hi> were ſurprized in their March with the news of theſe diſturbances in <hi>Georgia,</hi> and not rightly apprehending the cauſes of theſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den commotions, gave an arreſt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of their Arms, inclining towards the parts of <hi>Georgia,</hi> to be in a readineſs to ſuppreſs all deſigns againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, ſo that the thoughts of War againſt the <hi>Curdi</hi> was for ſome time laid aſide. The news of theſe troubles did alſo alarm the Port, with which alſo came a report, That ſix hundred Tents of the <hi>Kuzilba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhees</hi> (which are the beſt ſort of <hi>Perſian</hi> Horſemen) were pitched nigh the Confines of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Territories; ſo that Orders were diſpatched to the aforeſaid Paſhaws to watch the motion and iſſue of thoſe Affairs, but thoſe ſtorms blowing over by the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Achic-baſh,</hi> the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Forces proceeded on their firſt deſign againſt <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taza,</hi> marching to the paſs of the Country of the <hi>Curdi,</hi> which is very ſteep, aſperous and rough. The whole Kingdom being, as it were, one Mountain of dangerous and difficult acceſs, hath hitherto preſerved the Inhabitants from the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. The entrance thereunto being ſtrong by Nature, is alſo fortified with ſeveral Caſtles, the chief of which, poſſeſſed by <hi>Mortaza,</hi> is called <hi>Zizri,</hi> and the People there abouts <hi>Zezidi.</hi> The <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army being arrived at this paſs, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Paſha of <hi>Darbiquier,</hi> appointed General, as we have ſaid before, ordered five hundred of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect men to enter within the paſs, which the <hi>Curdi</hi> perceiving, with little oppoſition, put to flight, being ſo commanded by the General; the unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed <hi>Curdi</hi> eagerly purſuing the enemy, left the paſs naked, and undefended, ſuppoſing their whole victory and ſucceſs to conſiſt in the Rout of thoſe few: Whereupon the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army wiſely poſſeſſed the paſs, and got between the <hi>Curdi,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Curdi.</hi>
                        </note> and their place of Retreat, and laying the Siege to the Caſtle, required them either to ſurrender them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe <hi>Mortaza</hi> and his Complices into their hands.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Curdi</hi> perceiving themſelves thus hardly beſet, and in a manner defrauded, their Gariſon which poſſeſſed the paſs without the Confines, the Enemy gotten poſſeſſion of the Gate which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Country, their Caſtles beſieged, and in danger to be gained, and an inlet made to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation by their Enemies, cauſed them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt a three days truce for Conſultation, which being granted, they began to conſider, whether it were better to hazard the welfare of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a dangerous War, of which the <hi>Turks</hi> having already compaſſed the paſſage, had made half the Conqueſt; or to ſurrender up <hi>Mortaza</hi> to his own King, one in whom they had no part, no intereſt, nor relation. The latter Counſel was moſt generally pleaſing; wherefore they ſeized <hi>Mortaza,</hi> promiſing at firſt to conduct him through the Mountains to the <hi>Perſians;</hi> but afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Horſe-back, and about a Mile diſtant from the Camp, they bound his hands behind him, and with his Steward, the Maſter of his Horſe, and a Page, delivered him into the hands of the <hi>Turks,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of <hi>Mortaza</hi> into the <hi>Turks</hi> hands, and his death.</note> who immediately ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:39539:64"/>And thus ended this famous <hi>Mortaza,</hi> who had in like caſes, by order of this Viziers Father, been an active Executioner of other Paſhaws, and now included in the ſame Fate, by means of the Son, being proſcribed (as we have ſaid before) by Teſtament, and the moſt likely of any Paſha in the Empire to ſtand in competition for the Office of Vizier.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier upon this ſucceſs began to ſhew a more cheerful Countenance than formerly, ſuſpecting leſs of danger upon removal of ſo ſuſpicious an Enemy. And truly it was now hard to ſay where in the whole Empire was a generous, bold, or ambitious ſpirit remaining, who had Reputation and Authority enough to attempt a priority, ſuch havock was made by this Viziers Father of all hopeful and daring diſpoſitions, and ſuch an Addition made to the ſlaughter by this man in preſent Office, that whether mens ſpirits were vanquiſhed, and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with former Examples, or that the Age really afforded not ſuch Heroes, it is hard to ſay: None now appearing other than obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious to this Vizier, and to fear, and court him.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier having thus ſucceſsfully contrived his Eſtabliſhment, and ſecurity at home, had time to confirm it by his Wars abroad, well judging that foreign Wars allay Civil Diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Proſperity thereof doth both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce reputation and terrour of his Perſon amongſt his Enemies, as well as reconcile affections, and increaſe Authority amongſt his ſubjects at home. Wherefore he meditated on a War againſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, and was glad to embrace the occaſion from the late Diſturbances made in <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> by <hi>Kemenius,</hi> as we have related in the former Year. But yet like a crafty Politician, who looketh one way, and ſteers another; ſo the Vizier, that he might the better lull the <hi>Germans</hi> into a ſleep, and apprehenſions of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, he diſſembled his inclinations to Peace, and to hearken to ſuch propoſitions as were ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him by the <hi>German</hi> Reſident, namely, that the Fort of <hi>Serini</hi> ſhould be demoliſhed; being built againſt the intention, and without the knowledge or conſent of his Imperial Maſter; that the Gariſons of <hi>Zechelhid, Coloſwar,</hi> and other places ſhould be removed, with other over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the faireſt Propoſitions imaginable, which might give the <hi>Turks</hi> ſatisfaction, and by ſome means or other reconcile the differences, if poſſible.<note place="margin">The reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of War un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> To which counſel the Emperor was the rather inclinable, in regard that a Treaty at that time was on foot between the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> for <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult might prove prejudicial to the Empire, ſhould he at the ſame time be engaged in a War againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> whilſt as dangerous a friend as the other was an Enemy, crept eaſily into a ſuſpected Neighbourhood.

The <hi>Turks</hi> penetrating rightly into this Affair, preſſed hard to have a ſpeedy Peace, or War; wherefore the <hi>Reis Effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> or Secretary of State, did at a private Conference with the <hi>German</hi> Miniſter in name of the G. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and in few words declare, That three months were allotted to demoliſh the Fort built by the Count <hi>Serini,</hi> and for coming of an extraordinary Ambaſſador to confirm the Articles: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the Grand Signior unmindful of the time, and of the Conditions he had given, and prefixed for Peace, ordered the Vizier im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to prepare for the War, declaring that he would in Perſon accompany him in part of his March, and remove his Court to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> for this being a Country, champian, and plain, full of Game of all ſorts, ſo drew the heart and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of the Grand Signior, that his Seraglio at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſeemed as a Cage, or Priſon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe deſired Plains of <hi>Thrace:</hi> His Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were no paſtime or recreation to him, in whoſ Apartments he ſpent little time: For this exceſſive humour in Hunting made him daily to preſs the Vizier to depart for <hi>Adrianople,</hi> not that he had ſo real a deſire to the War, as he had to his Game; which gave occaſion to that ordinary Saying amongſt the Turks, <hi>That the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior had left ſome Hares behind him at</hi> Adrianople, <hi>and would return to ſeek them.</hi> At length the Vizier not longer able to reſiſt his importunity without his diſpleaſure, ſummon'd a Council of all the Viziers of the Bench, where alſo the Janiſar Aga was preſent, to conſult concerning the time of their departure, at which they unanimouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that for divers Reaſons, it was moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to defer this expedition until the next Spring.

Thirdly, Becauſe the Souldiers which were abroad could not have timely notice to repair to their Colours. Fourthly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many Souldiers had begun to rebuild their houſes deſtroyed by the late Fires, which by the Spring they might ſee finiſhed. And laſtly, That the Summer being now almoſt ſpent, was not ſo fit for action, as the Spring, which gives new life and blood to men, as well as ſap and moiſture unto Vegetables. Theſe Reaſons being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with all humility to the Grand Signior, he ſeemed to reſt ſatisfied, and his heat of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting <hi>Adrianople</hi> for the preſent allayed. And in the mean time, that the deſign againſt <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> might be the more covertly carried, it was given out that the preparations were intended againſt the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territories in <hi>Dalmatia, (viz.)

                     <p>This Letter was received by His Majeſties Ambaſſador with that humanity as was agreeable to his Noble Nature; and with that ſenſe of the Chriſtian Cauſe as became a Religious Miniſter of the Faith's Defender, and an Anſwer returned thereunto full of affectionate Piety and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But it was feared that the time was elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Diſeaſe proceeded too far to admit a gentle Cure; for it could not probably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that the Vizier ſhould, upon fair words or perſwaſions, or by the force of paſſionate and Rhetorical expreſſions, be induced to let ſlip the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:39539:65"/>fair opportunity of an intire and total ſubjection of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> And the truth is, herein lay the ground of the great Quarral between theſe two Emperors; for ever ſince the Defeat of <hi>Chimianus</hi> (or as the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> call him <hi>Kemenius</hi>) the <hi>Turk</hi> ſwallowing in his thoughts the intire ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Country, deſigned to reduce it to the Government of a Paſha, rather than of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Prince, though elected at the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Port; and in order thereunto, advanced beyond the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the ancient bounds, and pitched his Camp in the very Bowels of the Country. Theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings giving matter of jealouſie to all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the bordering Chriſtians; the Count <hi>Serini</hi> firſt haſtned the finiſhing of his fort, as much as was poſſible; and next, according to his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> in all parts of the Borders for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified their Towns and Caſtles, and reinforced their Gariſons; which was anſwered by the <hi>Turks</hi> in the like preparations. And thus mutual fears and jealouſies effected that ill Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in which the State of Affairs then remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>And ſince <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> is the preſent Scene of Action, it will not be much from our purpoſe to digreſs a little in declaring the ſtate of that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Principality, and by what ways and means the <hi>Turks</hi> encreaſed their Tribute, and encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Liberties; the which Relation I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from one of the <hi>Tranſilvanian</hi> Agents, to this effect.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>Sultan Solyman,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Hiſtory of <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian</hi> Miſery.</note> 
                        <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> was governed by her own Laws, and her natural Prince, paying then only Thirty Thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of yearly Tribute. After which <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha taking <hi>Varadin</hi> on the Frontiers, had ſome part of the Country alloted him for maintenance of his Gariſon, and at that time ſolemnly ſwore, That beyond thoſe Limits allotted to <hi>Varadin,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould not farther enter into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> but that Oath being little regarded, they have ſince that time poſſeſſed themſelves of ſix Provinces, <hi>(viz.) Bichar, Doboka, Halnock, Colos,</hi> in which is <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diopolis,</hi> and of the beſt part of <hi>Zarand.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Turks</hi> ſatisfied herewith, but in the year 1658. the Vizier <hi>Kuperlee</hi> entered <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and by force of Arms took the ſtrong Town of <hi>Janova,</hi> and demanded the Surrender of <hi>Lugas</hi> and <hi>Karanſebes</hi> into his hands. Nor could the allegations of the Oath of <hi>Sultan Solyman,</hi> or of <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, or any other perſwaſions or ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on induce him to moderate any part of his ſevere demands, until firſt having miſerably deſtroyed the whole Country, and ſatiated himſelf with blood, he was contented, upon the ſad and humble ſupplication of the ambaſſador from that Prince, to withdraw his Army out of <hi>Tranſilva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> on condition that Fifty thouſand Dollars of yearly Tribute ſhould be added to the former Thirty thouſand, and that <hi>Lugas</hi> and <hi>Karanſebes</hi> ſhould be wholly abandoned by the native Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and deliverd into poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turk:</hi> And as a mark of his abſolute Dominion over that Country, he forced one <hi>Achacius Barcley,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed before as Ambaſſador to him, to take on him the Government, threatning that if he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted not of the Charge, he would inveſt a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Principality: Notwithſtanding all this Treatment; and though the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with all the propoſitions offered them by the <hi>Turk,</hi> yet not long after the <hi>Tartar Han</hi> paſſed twice through the Country, miſerably harraſſing, ſpoiling, and killing, or making Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives all he met, whoſe departure alſo from this Country was purchaſed with a conſiderable Sum of Money. And this was the ſtate of the miſery of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> when the troubles raiſed by <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotzki</hi> and <hi>Kemenius</hi> added to the other diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and adminiſtred farther occaſion to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing War.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt the thoughts of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court were intent on their preparation for the next years War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> advice came that the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, conſiſting of Seventeen Ships, and Thirty ſeven Saiques, lately departed from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> bound for <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and convoyed by ſix Gallies, which met them at <hi>Scio,</hi> very rich with Money, and other goods, (whoſe returns are yearly for the moſt part made in Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, Coffee, Rice, and other Commodities) were encountred near <hi>Rhodes</hi> by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata, and ſuch ruine and prize made of them,<note place="margin">The <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi> Fleet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi>
                        </note> that of the Threeſcore Sail, Twenty eight Saiques, &amp; 4 Ships were ſunk and taken: <hi>(viz.)</hi> 18 Saiques taken, &amp; 10 burnt, 3 Ships taken, and one burnt, and thereon Two hundred and ſeventy Slaves, among which there were of note, <hi>Arnout Aſan Aga,</hi> Eunuch of the Seraglio, <hi>Mahomet Aga, Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut Agaſey</hi> of <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> and <hi>Emin Reis,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of a Ship. When this news arrived, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be at the Viziers Court, and perceived a ſtrange diſturbance and alteration in the faces of all then preſent; but more particularly the Grand Signior ſeemed to be heated with fury, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſolution of revenge; ſo that he had almoſt forgotten his deſigns againſt the Emperor; and quitting his paſtime in Hunting, he began to talk of tranſporting his Arms into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſent Orders to one <hi>Beco</hi> a Begh of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> to cauſe a ſurvey of the High-ways, Paſſages, and Bridges towards <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> as if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended immediately to march, and either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his <hi>Hungarian</hi> War, or wage both at the ſame time. But his graver, and more ſober Council mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated his heat with Reaſon, knowing that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Princes, though never ſo abſolute, muſt be ſubject to times and ſeaſons, until their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can extend to Omnipotency, which never yet could exceed the abilities of a mortal man, though ſome have affected Divine Honours, and by Flatterers have been ranked after death in the number of the Gods. The <hi>Venetians</hi> loſt Seventy men only, or thereabouts, and amongſt them <hi>Giacomo Semitecolo,</hi> a noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> with other Braves and Souldiers of Fortune. The <hi>Turks</hi> hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly touched with this loſs and diſgrace, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Grand Signior, who had an Intereſt in the <hi>Caravana,</hi> had a mind to vent ſome of their fury on Signior <hi>Ballarino,</hi> the <hi>Venetian</hi> Miniſter to the Port, like thoſe (as we ſay) who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beat the Horſe, will beat the Saddle; ſo that they intended to impriſon him again in ſome dark Cell, or obſcure retirement, of which, or of ſome other rigor Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> was ſo ſenſible, that he wrote this enſuing Letter to the Senator <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Contarini,</hi> which may ſerve to explain the anguiſh and ſorrowful apprehenſions of his Soul.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>IF my Mind were capable of Comfort, I could not in the midſt of ſo much anguiſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a more efficacious Motive thereunto, than thoſe obliging Expreſſions which your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency uſes towards me, who like a Terreſtrial Deity is pleaſed to protect me. But alas, I am too much overwhelmed with Grief to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Subject which may cauſe me to dry my Tears. I find no ſhelter againſt that Storm which I foreſaw. Nor is it ſufficient for me to diſcover the Tempeſt before it arrives: It is
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:39539:65"/>not ſufficient in this darkneſs to loſe my Sleep, diſturb my Quiet, tire my Body, debilitate my Health by a ſlender Diet, whilſt toſſed in the Boſom of an inexorable Element, I am denied the enjoyment of a ray of Light. I hold the Helm of the Ship as direct as I can, but the adverſe Waves of my Fortune drive me into the midſt of thoſe Storms where I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the greateſt Dangers: I am here in the midſt of the Sea, which is the Neſt of Extravagancies, the grand belief of unthought of Accidents, the ſpacious Theatre of Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, a fierce Giant, a horrible Monſter, who with gentle <hi>Opiates</hi> endeavonrs to lull aſleep, and lead thoſe to Deſtruction who have too great a confidence in their own Strength. I reproach my ſelf for not having been able to make it ſufficiently underſtood, how one ſtroke of adverſe Fortune is capable to put all into Danger, who are imbarked in the ſame Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; And as little able am I to inculcate into the minds of Men, that whilſt the Waves of the vaſt Sea are ſmooth and calm, the nearer is the raging of the Waters, and the fury of a Tempeſt. It was therefore neceſſary that there ſhould have been ſome more skilful Pilot than my ſelf to conduct this Veſſel. I was long ſince acquainted with my Imperfections, and therefore called aloud for the aſſiſtance of an abler Pilot, to direct me in this tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Region; but ſince I was not heard, I glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at leaſt to be alone in this Gulf, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſwallowed up by a final Ruin, my Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be a means to ſave the reſt. Rains and Lightnings do not affright me, but rather ſerve to quench that fire of Diſdain which I conceive againſt my ſelf, for not knowing how to perform better, and ſerve to enlighten me daily to find out that Compaſs or Cart which may direct me to a courſe or path of Security. I fear Thunders and Tempeſts, becauſe the violence of one, and the hardneſs of the other is able to render a cold Sweat mixed with Blood altogether unprofitable. This miſerable School, tho of eleven Tears continuance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me to ſtudy the Diſpoſition of the Stars, the Signs in the Air, the Ebbings and Flowings of the Waters, concealed Rocks, the Dangers of a long Voyage, and the neceſſity of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Port. I have ſtudied indeed, but I fear I have not well learned this profound Diſcipline; for where there is the greateſt ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, there I have gathered the leaſt Fruit; for ſince the Aſpect of the Spheres are become more inauſpicious, I am doubtful that I ſhall ſee the Ship beaten with ſwelling Surges, and being full of Water, it will be ſo far from being eaſed by thoſe opportune Remedies which I bring, that it will rather be encreaſed by my Tears. God grant by his miraculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, the Tranquillity which we deſire, and which by humune means will be difficult to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I had not the underſtanding to take Opportunity by the Foretop when She preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf unto me with gentle and benign Appearance, ſhowing me the means to ſave this floating Veſſel, and ſpare our inſidious rewards. For this Reaſon my dejected, but not conquered mind, makes my very Bowels feel an unuſual anguiſh of an over-troubled Eſtate. May it pleaſe the Divine pity, that theſe my Afflictions may prove the Off-ſpring of my own vileneſs, but not the means of my Ruin. I truſt therein, I confeſs, and yet frail hope, amidſt this Gulf of Sin, induces me to expect doubtful Succeſſes; Yet certainly I will endeavour to avoid a ſhipwrack on thoſe Rocks of Deſpair; And ſo imploring the Patronage of your Excellency here on Earth, I confirm my ſelf.</p>

                     <p>This Letter ſeems to be wrote in the ſtile of a deſpairing Perſon; yet if it be well conſidered, the meaning is no other than what the Iſſue of Affairs ſome years afterwards did evidence; and his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were no other than to deſcribe the ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Miniſters, and their obſtinacy of continuing a War, until they had wearied out the <hi>Venetians</hi> into an Humour of ſurrendring the whole Iſland of <hi>Candia</hi> unto them. I had the Honour to be well acquainted with the Perſon of Signior <hi>Ballarino,</hi> and I always eſteemed him in his external Behaviour accompliſhed with the Exceſſes of <hi>Italian</hi> Civility; he was endued with great fluency of Language, both in Diſcourſe and Writing; he was Jealous, Acute and Wary; and in ſhort, was a proper Miniſter for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, well practiced and verſed in the manner of Treaty with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court. He at firſt was ſent from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in quality of Secretary to the Excellentiſſimo <hi>Capello,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> a Perſon eminent for his Office, and the ſeveral great employments which he had exerciſed in that State; he was ſincere, and of a generous Soul; his comely Looks, and grave Habit ſpoke him to be a Gentleman, and a Senator. In ſhort, he was ſo well eſtemeed of at <hi>Venice,</hi> that he was thought worthy to be imployed in this Embaſſy to the Grand Signior, which is commonly granted to Perſons after they have run through all Services of the Commonwealth, as a Conſummation of their Honours and Richeſs. This Gentleman then had the misfortune to be inveſted in this Honour in the worſt of Times, when the War was broke forth, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by expoſed to their cruelty, he was put into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, where paſſing for ſome time a Life of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and Sadneſs, he fell into a Melancholly, which repreſented all things to him in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt manner; ſo that, I know not why his fancy ſuggeſted to him, that he was not only miſerable in his Impriſonment and Reſtraint amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> but that he was fallen alſo into diſgrace, and diſpleaſure of his Prince at home. I will not ſay that Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> did nouriſh the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this black humour in him; but I have heard that he did not adminiſter that comfort to him, as might ſerve to diſpel the thickneſs of that Vapour which obſcured the generous temper of his Soul. In ſhort, he gave ſuch way to this melancholly, that he laid violent hands upon himſelf (as we have ſaid before); but afterwards by the Care of his Friends and Servants, being cured of his wounds, he lived ſome years after, by his Sorrows and Repentance for it, to give Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God and the World. Howſoever, the Senate being informed thereof, and judging this Act to be the effect of a violent Phrenſy, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39539:66"/>
                        <hi>Ballarino</hi> to take on himſelf the intire manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Affairs, reſerving only the Title and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Signior <hi>Capello. Ballarino</hi> now manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Affairs, <hi>Capello</hi> looked on himſelf as neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and laid aſide, howſoever comported his Condition with Submiſſion and Gentleneſs, never openly reſenting the Honours of <hi>Ballarino,</hi> or to ſee him preferred before himſelf; Howſoever, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly nouriſhing an inward Diſcontent, his ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtious Nature, upwards of eighty years of Age, was forced to give way to its final Diſſolution; and falling Sick, he ſent to the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> then Ambaſſador for his Majeſty at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to acquaint him of his Diſtemper, deſiring him to ſend me, who was then his Secretary, unto him. At theſe Summons I was eaſily perſwaded to go, having always had his Perſon in great Reverence; and being come to his Bed-ſide, he raiſed himſelf upon his Pillows, and embracing me in his Arms, I fancied my ſelf to receive the Benediction of one of the Ancient Patriarchs. He began with a weak Voice to ſay to me, Sir, I am near my end, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting every Minute to render up my laſt Breath, and therefore as a dying man, I deſire of your Maſter, the Ambaſſador, that ſo ſoon as I am dead, he would be pleaſed to deliver this poor Carcaſs of mine from under the covering of this accurſed Roof. For Anſwer whereunto I did not ſtand to expoſtulate the Reaſons with him, well knowing the cauſe of his diſcontent; but that I would communicate his deſires to my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and ſpeedily return with my Anſwer to him. Accordingly I departed from him, and quickly brought from my Lord a Promiſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his utmoſt to comply with his requeſt; at which he ſeemed to be much ſatisfied, and commanded his Servants then preſent, eſpecially one called Sig. <hi>Tomaſo Gobbato,</hi> his great confident, to be Witneſſes thereof. The next day he expired his laſt Breath, and the day following his Body being embalmed, his bowels were buried, and the Funeral Rites performed with ſuch order and decency as was ſeemly in a Country where he lived rather like a Priſoner than an Ambaſſador. All things being thus prepared, the Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſea,</hi> according to the Will of the Deceaſed, ſent for his Body, already embalmed, which was immediately without oppoſition or ſcruple ſent to his houſe; where it remained for ſome months, in expectation of a conveyance for <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi> At length a Dutch ſhip, being bound from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> thither, it was deſigned that the Body ſhould be thereon imbarked; but I know not for what reaſon, the Cuſtomer refuſed to ſuffer it to paſs; though it may well and rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be conjectured, That <hi>Ballarino,</hi> who was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly touched to have the care of the Body of his Maſter, his Countryman and Colleague taken from him, did with Preſents prevail with the Cuſtomer to put difficulties in the way which he ſuppoſed might vex thoſe who were thought worthy of this employment. This oppoſition being made, and not to be overcome without much Money, it was contrived that the Ship departing ſhould attend the Corps at <hi>Tenedos,</hi> which was without the command of the Caſtles; and the body being divided from the Legs, was packed up in a But of Cavear, and ſo ſent down by a boat with Licence of the Cuſtomer, as a parcel of Goods and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice; and ſo ſafely arriving aboard, the Corps were ſeparated from their adjuncts; and being laid decently in a Coffin, covered with a Pall of black Velvet, with Scutcheons, and other orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appertaining to the Funerals of ſuch great Perſonages, it arrived ſafely at <hi>Venice,</hi> where it was interred with the uſual ceremonies, in the Tomb of the Anceſtors of that Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
                     <p>But the heads and thoughts of theſe Governours were not ſo employed in their preparations of War, but that the Vizier could lend an ear to the ſuggeſtions of ſome malicious Phariſees, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of Religion, informed him, That the Chriſtian Churches, burnt down in <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> and <hi>Galata</hi> by thoſe dreadful Fires in the year 1660, were again re-edified againſt his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the Law of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which allows the reparation of Churches, and continuance of ſuch which were found ſtanding when <hi>Mohometaniſm</hi> was introduced; but not to erect new, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build what are either by time, fire, or other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents fallen to ruine. And being farther informed,<note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the Chriſtian Churches rebuilt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fire.</note> that though thoſe Churches were reſtored under the notion of Dwellings, or Ware-houſes, yet ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly ſerved for Celebration of Divine Service, and thereby his Decrees and Edicts were fruſtrated and diſappointed: Wherefore, furiouſly tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Zeal, commanded immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Authors of thoſe Buildings ſhould be impriſoned, the Churches themſelves levelled to the Foundation, and the ground whereon they ſtood confiſcated to the Grand Signior. This action, though naturally agreeable to the diſpoſition of the Vizier, who was a perfect <hi>Turk,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Zeal of a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Preacher.</note> zealous in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all points of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated after the ſevereſt ſort of Profeſſors, and one of thoſe whom they called Softaes; yet he was chiefly prompted unto this, and to a greater abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of Chriſtianity, by one <hi>Vanni Effendi,</hi> a Shegh, or Preacher, one who was as inveterate and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the Chriſtian Religion, as any <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> or Fanatick is to the Rites of our Church and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And thus we may ſee how troubleſom Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and <hi>Puritaniſm</hi> are in all places where they gain a Superiority; for this Preacher not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only to ruine the Chriſtian Churches, but perſwaded the Vizier that the terrible Fires in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata</hi> in the year 1660, and the laſt years unparallel'd Peſtilence, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable advance of the <hi>Turks</hi> on the Chriſtians for ſome years, were ſo many parts of Divine Judgments thrown on the Muſſulmen or Believers, in vengeance of their too much Licence given to the Chriſtian Religion, permitting Wine to be ſold within the Walls of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which polluted the Imperial City, &amp; enſnared the faithful by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to what was unlawful: Wherefore a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was iſſued, That no Wine ſhould be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſold within the Walls of the City. And it was farther intended, that <hi>Greeks</hi> &amp; <hi>Armenians,</hi> &amp; all other Chriſtians, who had Dwellings or Poſſeſſions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Walls of the City, ſhould within Forty days ſell thoſe habitations, and depart; which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhould be confiſcated to the Grand Signior; but God who ſupports the Faithful in Tryals of Perſecution, moderated this Decree, and reſerved ſtill this Church in the midſt of Infidels; not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering this City to loſe the Name nor Religion of that holy Emperor, who both erected, and chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; as alſo to preſerve moſt of the Churches, which though again uncovered, yet were redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Money from the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Nor was the <hi>Mohometan</hi> Zeal ſatisfied in Demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches themſelves, unleſs it vented part of its fury againſt the poor Workmen, which for their hire and days Wages erected them; ſuch as <hi>Greek</hi> Labourers, Maſons, and Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who were all beaten and impriſoned. But it happening at that time that the Queen Mother building a ſumptuous Moſch, and having occaſion of many Labourers and Artiſts to forward ſo vaſt a Work, ſent to the Maimarbaſhee (who is
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:39539:66"/>the Maſter work-man, or Cape, over all ſuch who are employed in Building) to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch a number of Carpenters, Maſons, and others, as were convenient to carry on that Fabrick with expedition; who readily replyed, That he would provide all that was poſſible, but could not promiſe a ſufficient number, unleſs thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi> were ſet at liberty, who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned by the Grand Vizier for building the Chriſtian Churches; which anſwer being reported again to the Queen Mother, ſhe interceded with the Vizier in their behalf, who being glad of any occaſion to gratifie to great a Lady, immediately releaſed them, without any fine or reward, which he deſigned to obtain for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Howſoever the Vizier not well brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an indignity (as he ſuppoſed) put upon him by ſo mean a Slave, as the Maimarba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhee, dealt with ſome of the impriſoned Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to accuſe him, as the Author and Licenſer of building the Chriſtian Churches. The <hi>Greeks</hi> eaſily enough perſwaded to pleaſe ſo great a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, accuſed him accordingly, whoſe Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though nor paſſable againſt a <hi>Turk</hi> by the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, yet ſerved the Viziers revenge for the preſent, who immediately commanded his head to be ſtruck off,<note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on the Cape of the Builders.</note> and his Eſtate confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; which was reported to conſiſt of Two thouſand Purſes of Money, every Purſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Five hundred Dollars, then found actually in his Houſe, which, if true, is a ſtrange Wealth for ſo ordinary a Perſon. But by this, and by many other inſtances, we may perceive that there is no People in the World more covetous and deſirous to amaſs Wealth than the <hi>Turks,</hi> nor none more uncertain to enjoy it.</p>
                     <p>About this time the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> having adviſed his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty that the <hi>Turks</hi> were ſenſible that the affront to the Perſon of <hi>Monſieur la Haye,</hi> his Ambaſſador, was contrary to the Law of Nations, and ſuch an injury as could not but provoke the Choler of ſo puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant a Prince to a juſt revenge; and knowing that his Majeſty being powerful at Sea, was able to extend his Arms to the utmoſt Confines of his Empire, whilſt the interpoſition of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries limited the <hi>Turks</hi> march by Land, and their ignorance and inability in Marine Affairs rendred them uncapable to arrive thoſe Banks of <hi>France,</hi> which the Sea waſhes: Theſe Conſiderations the <hi>French</hi> Merchants having perſwaded the King to be the thoughts of the Grand Signior, and that he deſired the continuance of the Peace and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with <hi>France,</hi> and as an evidence of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and diſpleaſure for the injury to Monſieur <hi>la Haye,</hi> the Father, his Majeſty was contented in ſatisfaction thereof to redreſs this injurious tranſgreſſion of the Law of Nations, by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary marks of favour and honour to the Perſon of Monſieur <hi>la Haye</hi> the Son; that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the uſual method and rule of Ceremony towards this Ambaſſador at his arrival, the World might be convinced of the real affection, and hearty deſire the Grand Signior had to renew his Peace, and preſerve his Commerce with <hi>France.</hi> This is ſuppoſed to be what the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Marſeille</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> governed by the Intereſt of their Trade, ſuggeſted to their King, to induce him to ſend an Ambaſſador to <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for at this time Monſieur <hi>Roboli,</hi> a Merchant,<note place="margin">Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from <hi>France</hi> to introduce a new Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</note> remained only as Conſul or Agent for the Affairs of Commerce. Things thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented at the <hi>French</hi> Court, the King diſpatched away two Gentlemen to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Grand Signior and Vizier, and one to the <hi>Sieur Roboli,</hi> the Agent, declaring that if the <hi>Turk</hi> would make amends for the laſt Affront done to the Ambaſſador, by ſome ſignal notes of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the abuſed Perſon of Monſieur <hi>la Haye,</hi> the Son, he would then condeſcend to confirm the Ancient League and Amity.

The <hi>Tartars</hi> were appointed to have in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs a Hundred thouſand Horſemen, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions on the Frontiers; likewiſe the Paſhaws of <hi>Darbiquier, Aleppo, Caramania,</hi> and <hi>Anatolia</hi> received their orders; and ſeven and twenty Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, accompanied with as many Veſts, after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> manner, were ſent to as many Paſhaws of the Empire, to diſpoſe the ſtrength of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in a Warlike poſture, ſo as to march when the Grand Signiors Commands ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to attend his deſigns: And that the occaſion of the War might appear the more juſtifiable, it was reſolved, That no Acts of Hoſtility, or other Breaches of Peace ſhould be pretended, than the Fort built by the Count <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> being a matter really againſt the Articles of the laſt Peace; the Demoliſhment whereof, the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Force intended to make the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end of their firſt Enterprize, in which if they encountred any oppoſition from the Emperor, the Cauſe of their War would be then the more plauſible; for as yet the Emperour had not fully declared his approbation of that Work, raiſed by <hi>Serini,</hi> as agreeable to his Aſſent, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. On the other ſide with no leſs caution and labour did the Chriſtians endeavour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Frontiers, by raiſing their Militia, and reinforcing their Gariſons, and eſpecially to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the new Fort near <hi>Caniſia,</hi> which, as it was thought ſo conſiderable, as to countervail the inconveniencies and miſeries of a War, ſo the Turk thought it neither honourable, nor ſecure, until he had ſeen it razed, and levelled with the ground.</p>

                        </note> that nothing ſeemed leſs probable, and it may be ſaid, leſs poſſible, than an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; behold, on a ſudden, an Accident fell out at <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence this War with the Turks received its life and heat, which becalmed much of the fury and ſtorm on the Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, and inclined matters in <hi>Germany</hi> towards propoſitions of Peace, fearing that <hi>Italy,</hi> who had begotten this War, was not able (as things ſtood) to contribute towards its maintenance and ſupport. The occaſion was this. It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in the ſtreets of <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours Coach was aſſaulted by the <hi>Corſi</hi> Natves of the Iſlle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> which are of the Popes Guard, the Page killed at the Boot of the Coach, and the Ambaſſadors Lady wounded; whether this barbarous act was deſigned againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ambaſſador by any Perſons of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, or malice of the People, is little to the purpoſe I have now in hand; only the King took this Affront ſo heinouſly, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no acknowledgments or ſatisfaction the Pope could make, could allay his juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any thing be imagined poſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate this indignity, beſides a VVar. This News of this Diviſion between the Son, and the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Father, filled all the Miniſters of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> with much Joy, and with ſubject of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expectation of the Event, judging now that their daily Prayers for the Diſcord of the Chriſtian Princes amongſt themſelves, were heard and granted, ſince they had ſo far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, as to diſunite the very Oeconomy of Chriſtendom. And now they imagined that this difference would have a forcible influence on their Affairs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and either incline the Emperor ſpeedily to a Peace, or otherwiſe to undertake a War on diſadvantageous terms. Things had an iſſue accordingly, for in a few Weeks after, advice came by Poſt from <hi>Ali</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, then at <hi>Temiſwar,</hi> that is <hi>Salam-Chaous,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Chuſaein,</hi> who had long ſince been ſent to <hi>Vienna,</hi> with more diſtinct Demands of what the Turks propoſed, and being ſuppoſed, through his long ſtay, to be detained a Priſoner,<note place="margin">The Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron of <hi>Gowez</hi> ſent to <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha.</note> was again returned, and with him had brought the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> as Internuncio, ſent to <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, to receive a more particular Imformation of the Turks propoſitions, for that the Emperor pretended, he was not as yet throughly ſatisfied therein. And thus matters, beyond all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, began to incline to an agreement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that <hi>Rome</hi> being now in danger her ſelf, not by the Turks, but by the Chriſtians, held her ſelf uncapable to adminiſter that Fuel to the Fire of War which ſhe had promiſed; ſo that the League treated there beginning to fail, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror grew faint, and the Princes cold, in their Preparations, wiſhing ſome Courſe could be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which might bring matters to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation. Such were the Diſcourſes and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Turks; in which condition we leave the ſtate of Affairs until the beginning of the next year; and in the mean time it may not be from our purpoſe, nor tedious to the Reader, to record what befel this year moſt remarkable to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and their Trade in <hi>Turky,</hi> which alſo may be beneficial, by inſtruction of paſt examples, to ſuch who ſhall for the future be concerned in the Traffick and Buſineſs of the Levant.</p>

                     <p>THE Meſſengers from <hi>Algier,</hi> as before related, having promiſed better Obedience for the future to the Commands of the Grand Signior, obtained a new Paſha for their City, and Country thereunto belonging; who before his departure, was enjoyned by the Grand Signior to diſpoſe Affairs with the Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſea,</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as might demonſtrate his diſpoſitions towards a Peace, and his deſire that the <hi>Algerines</hi> ſhould do the like, and accept of that Clauſe in the Articles,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:39539:68"/>prohibiting the ſearch of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, either for their own or Strangers Goods. The place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the meeting between the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and the Paſha, was a certain Chiosk, or Garden houſe, belonging to an Eunuch, the <hi>Aga</hi> of a Seraglio at <hi>Pera;</hi> where both parties being met, the Paſha declared that the Grand Signiors deſires were, That a Peace ſhould be concluded on the Ancient Capitulations, and that by him theſe Orders were to be carried unto <hi>Algier,</hi> from whence he was adviſed, that the <hi>Algerines</hi> were ready to accept thoſe Articles, if one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Ships ſingly appeared about the Treaty; ſo that the World might not eſteem their conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion to proceed from Force and Compulſion. Hereof Advices being ſent into <hi>England,</hi> a Peace enſued in ſome Months after; but what faith theſe Infidels kept will be related in the Sequel of this Story; the Memory of which is engraven with the Point of a Diamond, and the Loſſes which enſued thereupon to the Exchange at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> deſerve a particular Treatiſe, which in the mean time many Families retain in a ſad remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>May,</hi> Advice was brought to the Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, how that the <hi>Ann,</hi> a Frigat of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Royal Navy, commanded by Captain <hi>Jonas Pool,</hi> which had convoyed the general Ships to <hi>Symrna,</hi> in her paſſage homewards ſtopped at the <hi>Morea,</hi> and came to an Anchor near a place in that Country, called the Black Mountain, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious to Wood and Water in; to which end were landed threeſcore men, armed with Swords and Firelocks; theſe made havock of the Woods on all ſides, loading their Boats away as faſt as they could, and not only ſo, but ſet great Frees on Fire which in that dry Seaſon of the Year diſperſed it ſelf far and wide; which being ſeen at a diſtance in the Night, alarmed the People of the Country, ſo that the Begh; or Governor came down with ſome Force to diſcover the matter, ſuppoſing that ſome <hi>Malteſes,</hi> or <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> might be landed. At the approach of this Body of <hi>Turks,</hi> our Men quitted the Woods, and ſhifted away as faſt as they could to their Boats, of which Thirty eight eſcaped, the reſt falling ſhort were intercepted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> and Eleven of them were killed, and Eleven taken Captives; and of the <hi>Turks,</hi> two Aga's, and Two or Three others had the fortune to fall by ſome Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from our men, whilſt in this confuſion they endeavoured to defend themſelves. On the news hereof, our Lord Ambaſſador repreſented the whole matter to the Vizier, declaring, That it was lawful according to our Capitulations, to take refreſhments, and ſupply our wants in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and that therefore he demanded Juſtice on the Begh of the <hi>Morea,</hi> and reſtitution of the Captives. But the Vizier underſtanding that ſome <hi>Turks</hi> were killed in the skirmiſh, lent not ſo ready an ear to theſe Complaints; howſoever, to be acquitted of the Ambaſſadors ſolicitations, referred the buſineſs to the Examination and Juſtice of the Captain Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha: But it falling out that at that time the Conſul and Merchants at <hi>Smyrna</hi> had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy difference with the Captain Paſha, (which ſhall in the next place be related) was the Cauſe that all Applications to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Juſtice were ſuſpended, and a ſlow progreſs made towards obtaining the liberty of thoſe poor unfortunate men. Howſoever, ſome months after it happened that the Begh of the <hi>Morea</hi> being removed from that Government, and coming to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with his whole Eſtate, brought with him the Eleven <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> which he had taken, and offered them to ſale unto the Ambaſſador, who conſidering that they were <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and ſuch as had been enſlaved in actual Service of their King, he eſteemed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged both in Charity and Honour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them. But the Caſe appeared too foul to demand their Liberty by ſtrength of the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; for beſides that, the cutting Wood in places inhabited without permiſſion, is a Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and a Crime in its ſelf, not to be maintained by the Law of Nations, the killing of a principal Aga, and wounding others, might ſufficiently warrant the <hi>Turks,</hi> without any Breach of Peace, to detain theſe men as lawful Captives: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Ambaſſador deeming it unſeemly, that thoſe who had ſerved in his Majeſties Navy ſhould be condemned to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Gallies, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed Fourteen hundred Lion Dollars, which was demanded for them, which was afterwards repay'd him by his Majeſty; and having cloathed, and provided them with neceſſaries for their Voyage, conveyed them with the firſt occaſions into <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and the Captain Paſha which impeded the Liberty, for ſome time, of theſe Captives, had its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants making Collation one Evening in a Garden were aſſaulted and beaten by certain drunken<note n="*" place="margin">Soldiers belonging to the Sea. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, belonging to a Gally then in Port, in whoſe Company was a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Slave. The News hereof flying to the Frank Street, put all the Neighbourhood into an uproar, ſo that divers People with ſuch Weapons as came next to hand, in a fury went in purſuit of the Levents, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily meeting one, drew him into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſuls houſe, where they treated him with ſuch blows as abated much of the heat and fumes of his Wine; during which diſturbance and confuſion, the <hi>Portuguez</hi> Slave found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make his eſcape. The Conſul knowing it ſome advantage in <hi>Turky</hi> to complain firſt, ſent to the <hi>Kadi,</hi> giving him to underſtand the ill uſage of Four of his Merchants (whoſe names he gave in writing) by the unruly Levents, whilſt they innocently, and without injury to any, divertiſed themſelves in a Garden; to which, for the preſent, little more was given in anſwer, than that on a farther examination of the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Conful ſhould receive Juſtice In the mean time the Turk, who had been beaten in the Conſuls Houſe, reſolved not to leave the Gate till he had received ſatisfaction for his blows; and the others that were his Comrades demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Slave from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which was loſt, by whoſe means and aſſiſtance (as they pretend) he had made his Eſcape. The matter came now to high Demands on both ſides, which the <hi>Kadi,</hi> either not being deſirous, or not of ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to compound, the Gally departed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any agreement, and the complaint was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Turks to the Captain Paſha, who then being with his Fleet at <hi>Mytiline,</hi> with little other thoughts or buſineſs, was glad of this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to get Money, and therefore ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the Gally again, with Orders to bring before him the Four Merchants, whoſe names he particularized, to make anſwer to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation of having beaten his Levents, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the eſcape of the ſlave. The Conſul and Merchants being affrighted by this Meſſage, and Command of ſo great a Perſonage, endeavoured with Money to accommodate the Buſineſs, by force of which it was at length taken up, coſting in all the ſumm of Two thouſand ſeven hundred Dollars, or thereabouts. The which paſſage
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:39539:69"/>may ſerve for an example to ſuch as live in <hi>Turky,</hi> that all troubles of this nature are beſt compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for at firſt; for at the beginning nothing more was demanded than the price of the Slave, &amp; of the broken pate of the Levent: But being ſuffered to come under the Cognizance of powerful and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verous Tyrants; as there is no fahtoming their unſatiable deſires, ſo there is no proſpect into what inconvenient dangers ſuch Affairs will involve, and entagle themſelves.</p>
                     <p>As <hi>Turky</hi> hath been ſeldom or never without having falſe Money currant, ſo the beſt ſort of Silver hath been ſo clipped by the Jews, <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> Merchants, and others; that the Dollar was brought at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſix Drams, and at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to ſeven, which made great confuſion in the Trade of theſe Countries. Wherefore the Vizier as he had already given proof and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the World of his ſtrict obſervance, and adherence to the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Law, ſo he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to appear highly careful and ſenſible of the Publick Intereſt: And therefore as the moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work, he began with the Dollars of ſix Drams, proclaiming that they ſhould no longer paſs in payments,<note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier's Edict, againſt Dollars of ſix Drams.</note> and that thoſe in whoſe hands they were found, delivering them into the Mint, ſhould receive a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> 80 in return of every ſuch Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, by which means the Mint would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a Fourth on every Dollar, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Dram worth Fourteen Aſpers, and that for the preſent no Dollar being currant under ſeven Drams, it might afterwards be brought to Lyons, and Dollars of nine Drams; which regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, though at firſt grievous to ſome particular perſons, would afterwards redound to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon advanrage and benefit of Trade. To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which Deſign the Grand Signior, and Queen Mother ſent all their Dollars of ſix Drams to be new coined into Aſpers at the Mint, ſo likewiſe did the Vizier, intending to be very ſtrict in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of that Money. But a while after it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the Treaſurer of the Viziers Steward having occaſion to pay Monies, either for his own or his Maſters account, forced ſome Bags of Six Drams on thoſe to whom payment was to be made; the Receivers denied to accept them; but he being a powerful man, and very urgent, forced the Mony upon them, with which laden, as they had received them, they went directly to the Vizier, acquainting him that they were deſirous to obey his Commands, as to the ſix Dram Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but his Stewards Treaſurer had forced on them that ſort of Money, which if it was his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that they ſhould ſtill paſs, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive; if not, they deſired him to give Command for their payment in other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The Vizier being highly enraged, that the firſt Violation of his Commands ſhould begin in his own Family, immediately ordered, without farther proof or proceſs, that the Offenders Head ſhould be ſtruck off, and his body thrown into the Sea; which Sentence was executed in the ſame hour for example and terror of others, and to expiate the crime, and take away the ſcandal from the Fountain of Juſtice, whoſe ſtreams can never be eſteemed to run clear when the ſource is corrupted. In like manner the Overſeer of the Mint was ſtrangled, and <hi>Emir</hi> Paſha, formerly Paſha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> was baniſhed to the Iſle of <hi>Lemnos,</hi> for making the Coin of Aſpers 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> worſe than their true value.</p>
                     <p>The Merchants at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> being far from the Court,<note place="margin">Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants <hi>Aleppo.</hi>
                        </note> are more ſubject to troubleſom Avanias than others, who are nearer to the Head or Fountain, from whence Juſtice ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed as may appear by many examples, and particularly by an accident which fell out there this year. For it happened, that a Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary which ſerved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, riding abroad with ſome of the Merchants, for want of heed, or the unrulineſs of his Horſe, chanced to hurt a Youth playing in the ſtreets. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Merchants, and the Janiſary, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this buſineſs to come within the knowledge of the Cities Officers, immediately for ſome Money quieted the complaints, and ſtopped the farther demands of the Father; and to make the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more ſecure, cauſed the Father to make Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get before the <hi>Kadi,</hi> that he was well ſatisfied, and remained without farther pretence, either on the Merchant, or the Janiſary, for the hurt which his Child had received. But the Paſha, who had for a long time attentively watched an opportunity to extort Money from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was reſolved not to let paſs this fair occaſion; and therefore ſent to demand from the Conſul thoſe Merchants, which he called Acceſſories to this miſchief, and the Aſſaſſinates of a <hi>Muſſulman.</hi> The Conſul appearing in Perſon before the Paſha, denied to deliver up the Merchants, being guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of any crime; and that for hurt to the Child, the Father had received full ſatisfaction from the Janiſary, and given a diſcharge before the <hi>Kadi.</hi> Howſoever this reaſon would not pacifie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha, who could acknowledge no other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment available than a Sum of Money; and therefore in proſecution of his deſign produced Ten falſe Witneſſes, that the Child was dead of its hurt, and that <hi>Engliſh</hi> men had done the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The Conſul had now no other anſwer than a flat denial; for the Paſha had forced by threats the Hoget from the Janiſary, and perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with conſtancy in defence of his Merchants, the Paſha confined him for an hours time in a Chamber of his Houſe, and beat, and impriſoned his Druggerman. The Conſul afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home; and perceiving a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Paſha and the Mufti, purchaſed the favour of the Mufti on his ſide, and procured from him an Hoget of the ſeveral proceedings in this buſineſs, which was diſpatched away with all expedition to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that a redreſs of this injury might be obtained from the Superiour Power. Whilſt the Lord Ambaſſador in due manner reſented this breach of Capitulations, and prepared to make his complaints to the Vizier, it happened that certain Chriſtians of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> from whom the Paſha had forced 18000 Dollars by unjuſt extortion, were then at Court ſolliciting the reſtauration of their right. The Ambaſſador judging this a convenient and opportune prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to prepoſſeſs the mind of the Vizier with a true apprehenſion of the injuſtice of this Paſha, encouraged and pricked forward theſe abuſed and oppreſſed Chriſtians in their complaints; and the next day preſented his Memorial to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, containing all the particulars of the late paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> Which with the other Crimes alledged the Day before, ſo moved the mind of the Vizier, that he promiſed the Ambaſſador to ſend a Kapugibaſhee of the Grand Signior to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the Truth of theſe Allegations; and that he might be ſatisfied of his real intentions to do him juſtice, he adviſed him to ſend a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger in company with this Officer, who might witneſs the reality of his proceedings. The Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugibaſhee being in this manner diſpatched, and arriving at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> made the Paſha refund the Money he had unjuſtly taken from the poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Chriſtians of that Country; in which good action my Lord Ambaſador had been an uſeful inſtrument, having encouraged the Agents
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39539:69"/>of thoſe Chriſtians at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>counſelled them what Courſe to take, and introduced them by his Chief Interpreter to the Preſence of the Vizier, for which he received the thanks of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Armenian</hi> Patriarchs, who gratefully acknowledged to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> how much they were engaged to the charity and favour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ambaſſador: But whilſt all mens eyes were in expectation what farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings were deſigned againſt the Paſha in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the Officer denied to have received any inſtructions therein, and ſo return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> without taking notice of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Concernment. The Ambaſſador judging himſelf herein ſlighted, ſent to the Viziers Kahya to know the myſtery of this neglect; for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier and himſelf having pawned his word and promiſes to do him juſtice againſt the Paſha of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> it ſeemed ſtrange that his aſſurances ſhould vaniſh into nothing; and that he ſo mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed his Quality and Office, as to diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage it with ſo much diſrepute and contempt as muſt neceſſarily befal him, ſhould this Paſha eſcape without exemplary puniſhment; for then the World might with reaſon believe his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of no prevalency, and his Merchants fear the inſufficiency of his protection. To which the Kahya anſwered, That it was true, that the Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugibaſhee was not inſtructed in the Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in regard a more ſolemn and eminent piece of Juſtice was deſigned for the Ambaſſador, than any that could be performed by the Kapugibaſhee, and that in twenty or thirty days at fartheſt, the Paſha ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of his Office. The next day following the Kahya adviſed that the Hatteſheriff, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Command for depoſing of the Paſha, was ſigned, and that old <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha of <hi>Darbiquier</hi> was conſtituted in his place; which News was highly pleaſing to the Lord Ambaſſador, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he had been an ancient Friend to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> under whom he preſaged to our Nation at <hi>Aleppo</hi> all ſecurity and contentment.<note place="margin">Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on the Premiſes.</note> By which Story it is obſervable, That though the Supream Officers amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> are willing to ſatisfie Chriſtian Ambaſſadors reſident with them, in the Care they have of their Welfare, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their Capitulations; yet are not deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to publiſh to their own People the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Grand Officers, at the inſtigation or for the concernment of a Chriſtian: And that tho the <hi>Turks</hi> are apprehended amongſt us for a People of great Morality, and ſingleneſs in their Dealings; yet it is obſervable in this, as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their actions, that they have double Tongues and Faces, and know how to act with as fine a Thread, and plauſible pretences, as are accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the moſt politick and refined Courts of <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>About the middle of <hi>February</hi> the Horſe Tail was ſet forth at the Viziers Gate; (which is the uſual ſignal of the Camps motion within the ſpace of a Month) ſo that none may excuſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the War for want of due and timely intimation. And though the time for departure nearly approached, yet the Grand Signior was ſo impatient, that he would ſcarce expect until the Equinoctial,<note place="margin">The Gr.

                        </note> which was the Term formerly appointed and publiſhed for this expedition; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving ſometimes to proceed before, and leave the Vizier to follow him, letting fall words of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, That ſuch as loved and honoured him would keep him company. But this haſty reſolution, and eager deſire of his Journey, the Vizier, Multi, and others of his Counſellours, did mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, perſwading him to a little longer patience: to which, though with ſome difficulty, he aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; yet he could not forbear from his Horſes back, and conſtant exerciſes abroad, nor could he be induced to take one Nights repoſe longer in his great Seraglio at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but lodged at <hi>Daout</hi> Paſha, a ſmall Palace about four miles diſtant from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant manner of living moſt People at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:39539:70"/>to his wandring humour, and delights in hunting, riding, and ſuch like exerciſes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his ſole pleaſure in the Woods and Fields: But others, who judged with better Foundation, did conceive, That the Grand Signiors choice of other places of Reſidence rather than his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Seraglio, proceeded not ſo much from his own unſetled humour, and courſe of living, as from an apprehenſion of ſome Deſigns, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous Treaſons of the Janiſaries againſt him: For to ſpeak the truth, ſince the death of <hi>Ku<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlee,</hi> the Militia began again to be corrupted; and if we may believe the opinion of the moſt principal <hi>Turks,</hi> the Vizier undertook this War to employ the buſie ſpirits of the Soldiery, which began to grow reſty and inſolent through idleneſs, and by that means ſecure his own life, and eſtabliſh his Condition and Fortune.</p>
                     <p>The Equinoctial being come, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior would not have one days longer patience; for though the Seaſon was wet and rainny, yet the Tents were pitched; and though the Wind was ſo violent and forcible as overturned almoſt the whole Camp, yet no difficulties and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of Weather could give one hour of intermiſſion to the Sultans deſires: Wherefore on the Ninth of this Month,<note place="margin">March.</note> the Grand Signior departed from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> attended with his Court, his principal Officers of State, and with what part of his Army was then a in readineſs to march. The magnificence of the ſhow they made, was according to the uſual Solemnity, yet worthy the ſight of a Stranger, and perhaps not incurious to the Reader in its Relation.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valcade which the Gr. Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior made when he departed from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                        </note> marched with a ſingular Gravity, the ſeveral and diſtinct Orders of Civil and Military Officers in their proper Habits and Capariſons, the Santones in their wild dreſs followed by the Emirs, or ſuch as are of the Kindred of their falſe Prophet; the Great Vizier and Muſti rode in rank together, the Vizier on the left hand, the moſt honourable place amongſt the Soldiery, being the ſide to which the Sword is girt, as the right is of greateſt eſteem amongſt ſuch as are of the Law, being that hand which guides the Pen: The Trappings of the Viziers Horſe were plared with Gold, and before him were carried three Horſe-tails, called in <hi>Turkiſh (Tugh,)</hi> and behind him came about Three hundred and fifty Pages, all Young men well mounted, and armed with Jacks and Coats of Male: Next followed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Court, or Seraglio, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Paicks with Caps of beaten Gold, and embroidered Coats, the Solacks with Feathers, armed with Bows and Arrows; theſe two laſt are of the higheſt degree of Lacqueys, which more nearly attend the Perſon of the Grand Signior; theſe were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Nine led Horſes of the Grand Signior, richly adorned with precious Stones, and Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers all covered with Jewels of an unknown value. Immediately before the Perſon of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior was led a Camel carrying the Alcoran in a Cheſt covered with cloth of gold: The Gr. Signior himſelf was clothed in a Veſt of cloth of gold lined with a Sable incomparably black, held up from the ſides of his Horſe by four Pages; his Perſon was followed with great numbers of Eunuchs, and Pages with long red Caps wrought with Gold about the head, carrying Lances and Mails, with two Locks, one on each ſide of their Head, which are worn by ſuch only as are of the Royal Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: After theſe crowded great numbers of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with the chief Comp. of Saphees, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Selictor Aga,</hi> in number about 1800. And in this manner and order they marched to their Tents.</p>
                     <p>The Tents were raiſed on a ſmall Hill, as may be judged about Four Miles diſtant from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and about Two Thouſand in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ranged at that time without order, only the Grand Signior's ſeemed to be in the midſt, and to over-top all the reſt, well worthy obſervation, coſting (as was reported) One hundred and eighty thouſand Dollars,<note place="margin">The rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Tents.</note> richly embroidered in the inſide with Gold, and ſupported by Pillars plated with Gold.

On the right hand hereof was pithced the Grand Viziers Tent, exceedingly rich and lofty; and had I not ſeen that of the Sultans before it, I ſhould have judged it the beſt that my eyes had ſeen. The oſtentation and magnificence of this Empire being evidenced in nothing more than in the richeſs of their Pavilions, ſumptuous beyond the fixed Palaces of Princes, erected with Marble and Mortar.</p>
                     <p>On the Sixteenth of this Month the <hi>Aga</hi> of the Janiſaries firſt raiſed his Tents,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> begin their March.</note> and began his march; the next day followed the Grand Signior, Vizier, and other Officers, and Spahees. At which time all <hi>Aſia</hi> was full of Soldiers flocking from all parts of the Eaſt, as from <hi>Aleppo, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus, Arabia, Erzirum,</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> So that for a long time Boats and Barks were continually imployed to ferry the Souldiery from <hi>Scutari</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Europe:</hi> And the High-ways, Villages, and all parts of the Road towards <hi>Adrianople</hi> were filled with Soldiers, as if all <hi>Aſia</hi> had iſſued out to devour and inhabit the <hi>German</hi> Poſſeſſions. And for greater expedition in the march of the Army, Proclamation was made of a general Rendezvous at <hi>Sophia</hi> at the<note n="*" place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> Feaſt.</note> 
                        <hi>Biram,</hi> then within Three weeks time, where they deſigned to ſoil their Horſe, and refreſh themſelves before they fell in earneſt to their buſineſs. But before the Grand Vizier departed from <hi>Adrianople</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a War in <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the Emperor, he called Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> to his preſence, as if he would treat with him of matters tending to an adjuſtment with <hi>Venice;</hi> when at the ſame time he had 20000 men in a readineſs at <hi>Scutari</hi> to march into <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and to joyn with other Forces in <hi>Boſna</hi> and <hi>Croatia;</hi> but this diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and appearance of Treaty ſerved only to diſcover on what Terms a Peace might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in caſe Affairs in <hi>Hungary</hi> ſhould be ſo preſſing as to require an application ſolely of Arms to that Country.</p>
                     <p>Not only had Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> Affairs of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick trouble, but likewiſe ſomething touched him of private concernment in his own Family; where the <hi>Turks,</hi> I know not upon what infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation coming to fearch, found in his Houſe two figures, one of a man, and the other of a woman made of Linen cloth, ſtuffed with Wool and Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; the which were interpreted by the <hi>Turks</hi> to be Images of Sorcery and Inchantment; one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the Grand Signior, and the other his Mother, were deſigned in a ſecret manner, by thruſting Needles and Pins into thoſe parts, where the Heart and Liver is, to cauſe thoſe whom they repreſent to dye with macerations and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, according to the Inchantment of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea. In jecur urget acus.</hi> And this ſuſpicion
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39539:70"/>was augmented by the reports of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, who hearing the Prieſt often recite his Litany, and ſing Evening-ſong, avouched that they conſtantly over-heard the Charms muttered in ſuch forms as are uſed by Magicians and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers: Wherefore deſigning to take the Prieſt, who was the Father Provincial of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and puniſh him for his Witchcraft, the good man fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fled, and kept himſelf out of harms way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> could quiet the minds of the <hi>Turks</hi> by ſome Art, which he more forcibly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed upon them by a ſtronger charm of Money and Preſents than that which was the ſubject of their complaint.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time all fears and dangers of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> vaniſhed, becauſe the <hi>Turks</hi> bent their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and chief of their ſtrength againſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at Land: To provide againſt which, the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> ſent into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> the Baron <hi>Spaar</hi> for General, with many other Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, namely the Marqueſs <hi>Maculani,</hi> Count <hi>Ettore Albano, Carlo Martinengo,</hi> and <hi>Roverelli,</hi> Count of <hi>Caudes,</hi> the Cavallier <hi>Grimaldi, Echen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt,</hi> and others. Into <hi>Friuli, Franciſco Moroſini</hi> was diſpatched in quality of Proveditor General with ſupream Power and Authority, and in this manner all matters were as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided and ſecured by Land, as they were by Sea.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Biram</hi> chanced to happen out this Year towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> by which time the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, and moſt of his Army, aſſembled according to Proclamation at <hi>Sophia;</hi> where having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſome time, and conſulted well in what manner to put their deſigns in execution, they proceeded in their March towards <hi>Buda,</hi> and the Confines of <hi>Hungary;</hi> but in the way the Vizier was encountred by a Meſſenger from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, offering all reaſonable Propoſitions of Peace, if poſſibly a ſtop might be given to the farther progreſs of that vaſt and formidable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. All matter, were propoſed which probably might give ſatisfaction; the Fort of Count <hi>Serini</hi> (the grand Eye-ſore of the <hi>Turks</hi>) was proffered to be demoliſhed, with other Conditions which before the March of the Army were never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or demanded. But the Vizier gave little ear to theſe fair Overtures, but proceeded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in his Demands, as he did in his March: Requiring now, not the demoliſhment of the Fort, but the Surrender of it entirely with all the Strength, Artillery, and Ammunition into the hands of the Grand Signior. Had this condition been granted, it is probable the deſires and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions of the <hi>Turks</hi> would not have ſtopped here, but have riſen, as the ſpirits of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had condeſcended, and exceeded all the hopes and advantage which they imagined pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and feaſible to be obtained by the War. Wherefore this Meſſage proving fruitleſs, the Bringer of it was permitted Licence to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany:</hi> But the Reſident was refuſed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, being detained in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, as an Inſtrument to mediate a Peace, when both ſides ſhould grow weary of the War.</p>
                     <p>About this time the <hi>Tartars</hi> were greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by the Coſſacks, who were then very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable and ſtrong,<note place="margin">The Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks infeſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi>
                        </note> approaching near the City of <hi>Oſac,</hi> the Key and chief Fortreſs of <hi>Tartary,</hi> under the Commann of a Fiſherman of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> who having had great ſucceſſes, and collected a conſiderable ſum of Money, became a dangerous Enemy: By Sea alſo they commanded abſolutely, roving uncontrouled, having a Fleet of Saykes and Gallies near an hundred and fifty Sail, againſt whom the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> or King of <hi>Tartary</hi> craved of the Grand Signior forty ſail of Gallies that year to oppoſe them. But this Force of the Coſſacks was ſoon abated; for it pleaſed God, that paſſing out of the <hi>Palus Moeotis</hi> through the narrow paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Colchos</hi> into the Black Sea, the beſt part of this Fleet ſuffered ſhipwrack; with which they were ſo diſmayed, that the twelve ſail of Gallies (which was the whole Force the <hi>Turks</hi> could ſpare this year for that Sea) gave a check to the remainder, and forced them again to the Banks of the <hi>Boriſthenes.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Fleet, conſiſting, together with the Beys Gallies, in all but of thirty Sail, departed from <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with deſign rather to make ſome appearance of a Fleet, and a noiſe amongſt their own people, and collect the Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Iſles in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> than out of hopes of effecting any thing againſt the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and ſo it ſucceeded; for this Fleet remained the whole Summer at <hi>Mytilene,</hi> not daring to appear abroad for fear of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Though the <hi>Tartars</hi> were ſo hardly beſet by the Coſſacks, yet their danger at home was not a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient excuſe to diſingage them from their aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the War of <hi>Hungary.</hi> For the Vizier marching towards the Frontiers, ſent one Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger after the other to haſten the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> with all ſpeed poſſible to the Wars. But the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> ſeeming not ſo willing, or ſo ready as the <hi>Turks</hi> expected, more poſitive commands, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threats, were diſpatched than before, that laying aſide all excuſes or delays, they ſhould with all the Force of their Country attend in this preſent War againſt the Emperor,<note place="margin">The <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go to the War.</note> or otherwiſe the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> was to be deprived of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and his Son conſtituted in his place. Theſe ſevere menaces reduced the <hi>Tartar</hi> to great ſtraits; fearful he was to diſpleaſe the Sultan, not knowing what ill conſequences might proceed from thence; but more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive he was of the approaches of the Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, and of the diſpleaſure of his own People, who were reſolved to ſee this fire of War extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in their own homes, before they would attend the deſigns, or ſatisfie the Luſts of a ſtranger Prince. In this Dilemma the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> finding himſelf, made uſe of fair words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ingaging his word. That after the harveſt was paſt, no obſtacle ſhould prevent his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Sultans expectations; for at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it was impoſſible, in regard that ſhould their People at this ſeaſon be diverted from gathering the harveſt, the Corn and Fruit would remain on the ground, and ſo occaſion a Famine and deſtruction of their Country. And herein the <hi>Tartar</hi> had ſome reaſon; for theſe People go not to the Wars, as other Nations, who leave a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number behind to cultivate their Country, and perform all other Offices and Imployments in a Common-wealth: But theſe making their chief livelihood and ſubſiſtence on the prey and robberies they make on their Neighbours;<note place="margin">The courſe of life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Tartars.</hi>

But the <hi>Turk</hi> whoſe deſires are never ſatisfied with reaſons, or withſtood by words, or with any thing beſides the execution of his Commands, diſpatched another Meſſage more full of threats and reſolution than formerly,<note place="margin">They are threatned again.</note> carried by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahor, or Maſter of the G.

To this City alſo was this <hi>Kuzlier</hi> Aga exiled, who in the enjoyment of his Office for ſeveral years, had amaſſed a moſt vaſt Wealth, incredible to be ſpoken, and much to be wondred, that a Negro, whoſe hue and perſon is contemptible amongſt all, whom God hath created of a Colour diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe who partake more of Light, and are of nearer ſimilitude with the Sun, and Nature of an Angel; one whoſe Original was a Slave, and his price never above a Hundred Pieces of Eight, ſhould be loaded with ſuch Goods of Fortune, and enriched with the Treaſury of a Prince: His Retinue conſiſted of about 900 Horſe, (beſides Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels, and Mules for his Baggage) amongſt which a Hundred were led Horſes, worth Seven or eight hundred Dollars a Horſe, and that he might ſtill ſeem to live by his Princes Bounty, a thouſand Aſpers a day was to be his conſtant pay, to be iſſued out of the G. Signiors Revenue in <hi>Egypt;</hi> by which we may in part calculate the greatneſs of this Empire, when ſo vaſt Richeſs is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted but a reaſonable proportion for ſo vile and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:39539:71"/>mean a Slave: Howſoever the Grand Signiors Treaſury ſuffers little hereby, for this wealth and pomp is but lent him to keep, and look on; he is uncapable to make a Teſtamen, or conſtitute an Heir; the Grand Signior himſelf ſucceeding to all the Eſtate he hath given him, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it. This Negro being proceeded as far as to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had his Companion the Balragibuſhee, recalled from him with deſign to be put to Death, but afterwards by mediation of ſome powerful Friends, who took advantage of the gentle and benign humour of the Sultan, his pardon was obtained, and he preferred to a ſmall<note n="*" place="margin">Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Paſha.</note> Paſhalick in the leſſer <hi>Aſia.</hi> Howſoever the Eunuch proceeded in his Journey to <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> where being arrived, after three Days, was by the Imperial Command ſtript of all his wealth and greatneſs, which amounted unto Two Millions of Dollars, to be reſtored again to their firſt Maſter, who uſes to lend his Slaves ſuch gaieties and Ornaments, only to afford the World occaſion to ſee and admire the vaſtneſs of his Wealth, and contemplate the vanity and unconſtancy of Richeſs and Worldly glory. This poor Negro thus deveſted of all, returned to his primary condition of a Slave, in which he was born, and for many years had lived, and was now baniſhed, forſaken, and diſconſolate in the upper <hi>Egypt;</hi> whither going ſcarce with ſufficient to preſerve him from Famine and Beggery, the Beyes of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of compaſſion, beſtowed on him an Alms of twelve Purſes, being Eight Thouſand four hundred Dollars, according to the Account of <hi>Cairo,</hi> now the only ſupport and ſuſtenance of his Life.</p>
                     <p>This Victory gained over theſe great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, and foyl given to the Queen Mother her ſelf, was not carried by this young Favourite with that prudent equality of mind as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; but being puffed up with pride and glory, adventured to a judgment and cenſure of the deepeſt matters of State, which touched not a little the jealouſie and ſcorn of the Great Vizier, who therefore wrote to all thoſe grave Sages, to whoſe Counſel he conceived the Sultan gave any ear or credit; repreſenting with extraordinary paſſion and fervency the dangers he apprehended might befal his Maſter, and his Empire, whilſt both were ſubject to the unexperienced Counſels of <hi>Aſan,</hi> a Youth both in years and knowledge. That it was much to the diſparagement of the Supream Office of Vizier whilſt was with Thouſands of <hi>Turks</hi> on the Frontiers contending for the Glory and Enlargement of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, ſubjected to millions of dangers and labours; to be ſupplanted by a Boy, fit only for an attendants in his Maſters Chamber; and to have the privacy of the Emperors State Counſels and policy rifled by a Youth, whoſe years had not fitted him for the knowledge and continence of an ordinary Secret. Theſe reaſonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the Vizier's were by ſome of his wiſe Friends, whoſe Age and Gravity had produced ſomething of Reverence towards their Perſons, not without hazard and fear communicated unto the Sultan, the violence of whoſe Love being with time moderated and abated, he began to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reaſonableneſs of this Diſcourſe, and ſo on a ſudden, to the great admiration of all, caſt off his Favourite, creating him a Kapugibaſhee, or chief Porter, with a hundred and fifty Aſpers a day Sallary.</p>

                     <head>The Ruine of <hi>Samozade,</hi> the Reis Effendi, or Chief Secretary of State to the Great Vizier.</head>
                     <p>AND ſince we have related a Story which partly repreſents the unconſtancy and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Greatneſs, it may yet pleaſe the Reader, ſhould we add another, tho' a little out of its due order, not leſs remarkable, and worthy of Record, than the former.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Newhauſel</hi> was beſieged, called by the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hungarians, Oyar,</hi> and divers attempts made on it in vain; <hi>Samozade</hi> the Reis Effendi, with leſs caution and wiſdom than he did uſually practiſe in other matters, wrote a Letter to the Chief Eunuch of the Women, then in the Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to this effect. That if the Grand Signior deſired to have that Fortreſs taken that was then beſieged, he ſhould chuſe a more able Captain for his Army than the preſent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, a Perſon who had only been educated in a Tekeh, or Colledge, and ſtudied in the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Law, and not in the Oda's of the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries, or Cuſtomes and Exerciſes of the Camp: And therefore if his Majeſty thought fit to chuſe another General, he could not caſt his eyes on any more able and deſerving than <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha his Son in Law, a Perſon qualified for the Office of Vizier, being skilful in all points both of War and Peace. This Eunuch being the perſon that had ſucceeded to the former lately exiled, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received this Letter, immediately without farther Art or Prologue, read it to the Grand Signior, at which though at firſt he was ſtartled, yet not as yet weary of the Vizier, but ftill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a kindneſs and eſteem for him, took the Letter from the Eunuch, and ſent it to the Vizier, permitting him to inflict what puniſhment he judged moſt agreeable to his own preſervation and vindication of honour. The Vizier, having received this Letter, ſeemed not in the leaſt to be ſurprized with the perfidiouſneſs of <hi>Samozade,</hi> but in a cool temper recollecting all the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Addreſſes (which we have mentioned before) at his firſt entrance into this Supream Office, and judging from thence, that he was not a Perſon capable of friendſhip, or a ſteadineſs to his Intereſt, ſent for him, and for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha his Son in Law to his preſence, and firſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upbraided his Treachery, and want of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, in return to all the Careſſes and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours he had uſed to win his Faith, cauſed both their heads to be ſtruck off by the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Samozade</hi> was one of the moſt wiſe and beſt practiſed Secretaries of State that ever ſerved the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and one whom our <hi>Engliſh</hi> much lamented, being perfectly acquainted with the particulars of our Capitulations, and Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Trade; and had not his extraordinary Covetouſneſs blemiſhed his other moral Vertues, he might have been eſteemed a man rare, and a Miniſter not unworthy the greateſt Monarch of the World. The Richeſs he had collected du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of his State-Negotiations were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible and immenſe, for he ſpared and loſt no opportunity of gains, which rendred him the more liable and obnoxious to the ſtroke of Juſtice. His Goods were now ſeiſed on for ſervice of the Sultan, his Maſter, as juſtly confiſcated for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; his Eſtate was found to amount unto three Millions of Pieces of Eight in ready Money; he had ſixteen hundred Camels, four Hundred

                     <p>BEfore we proceed on with the Relation of the War in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where we for a time ſhall leave the Great Vizier, it will not be from our purpoſe to digreſs a little in recounting certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Accidents, which had reference to our own and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nations Intereſt at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court. And firſt I ſhall begin with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to whom a conſiderable trouble and misfortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, by means of a Ship of their called the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Octaviano,</hi> which deſigning to lade <hi>Turks</hi> Goods at <hi>Alexandria</hi> for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had her Licence and Diſpatches obtained by means of the <hi>Holland</hi> Reſident, the Sieur <hi>Warnero.</hi> This Ship being accordingly laden at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> whereon alſo the Grand Signior himſelf had Thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dollars Intereſt, and being ready to depart, was near the Port ſurprized by the <hi>Venetian,</hi> and <hi>Malteſe</hi> Corſairs, and ſo taken. This News was poſted over land from Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſent of the Goods, importing Fourſcore and four thouſand Dollars, which in the Month of <hi>June</hi> arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in this loſs being many, in the nature of a Tumult applied themſelves to the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and demanded ſentence againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſident for reparation, alledging that he had recommended the Ship, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who had combined with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſairs to ſurprize him, and that the Reſident had engaged for the faithfulneſs of the Captain, who had betrayed their Goods, not endeavouring to defend himſelf ſo much as by the ſhot of one Musket. The Grand Signior being likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein himſelf, was eaſily perſwaded to grant his Order and Sentence, That the loſs of all ſhould concern the <hi>Dutch</hi> Reſident, and his Nation, requiring the Chimacam of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſummon the Reſident, and intimate his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein, exacting a time limited for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Reſident being called to ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences thereupon, denied to have had any hand in the employment of this Ship on the this Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that their Capitulations, to which the Grand Signior had ſworn, acquitted him from being reſponſible for the miſdemeanors of any of his Nation, for whoſe fidelity and good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he had never perſonally engaged, and thereupon poſitively refuſed to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf liable for payment of this Money, to which he was neither obliged by the Law of Nations, nor his own private Act. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, the <hi>Turks</hi> ſentenced the Reſident to be liable to make ſatisfaction, in regard that when the Ship was firſt freighted, he appeared before the Chimacam at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and being asked whether the Commander of this Ship was an honeſt man, and one who might be intruſted with ſuch a concernment of the <hi>Turks;</hi> his Anſwer was, That he believed he might, and that he was always eſteemed faithful and honeſt to his Truſt: which in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Law amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to as much as if he had ſaid, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ſecurity, the Grand Signior confirmed the former ſentence againſt the Reſident, and with haſte and fury diſpatched a Kapugibaſhee to bring his Perſon to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> where being arrived, and continuing as yet conſtant to his firſt Anſwer, was committed to cuſtody of the Chaousbaſhee, or Chief of the Purſuivants, where they gave him time until after the Feaſt of the little <hi>Biram,</hi> to conſult his own good and ſecurity of his Nation within the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. The Feaſt was no ſooner ended, but the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior ſent immediately to know his untimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, declaring, That if he continued ſtill obſtinate againſt his Power, he had commanded that he ſhould be committed to that Dungeon which had ſome few years before been the Lodging of other Chriſtian Miniſters. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident terrified at the thoughts of ſuch an Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, declined from his former conſtancy, ingaging to pay the Money in an Hundred and five days time, for no longer would be granted; ſo violent and unreaſonable the <hi>Turks</hi> were in their demands, againſt the Law of Nations, the particular Capitulations, and the common reaſon and juſtice of the World. This Money was for the moſt part taken up by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Turky</hi> at Intereſt, and afterwards the debt extinguiſhed by Money lent them by the States, ſor payment of which a particular Impoſition was granted on all Goods brought from <hi>Turky,</hi> until the Debt to them was cleared, with an Intereſt of one <hi>per cent.</hi> for the year. By which it may be obſerved, how little are eſteemed the Perſons of Chriſtian Repreſentatives in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court; who having proved with what tameneſs ſome Princes have taken the affronts offered to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their Ambaſſador in former times, and now obſerving with what patience the States of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have ſuſtained the like inſolence and injury in their Reſident, they may poſſibly profeſs their Function ſacred, but yet in matters of their own intereſt will never be induced to vouchſafe them that reſpect or juſt treatment which is due to them.</p>

                     <p>IN the preceding year we declared how a Peace was concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Algier:</hi> For better confirmation whereof, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our Merchants Eſtates in the <hi>Levant,</hi> upon occaſion of a future breach, it was judged neceſſary by His Majeſties Council, That the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Articles laſt made and concluded with <hi>Algier, Tunis,</hi> and <hi>Tripoli,</hi> ſhould be diſtinctly
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:39539:72"/>deſcribed and ratified by the Grand Signior, with this Clauſe at the Concluſion of each, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That in caſe the foregoing Articles were not kept by theſe his Subjects reſpectively, but ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the meaning thereof through Piracy be broken, that then it ſhould be lawful for the King of <hi>England</hi> to chaſtiſe thoſe People by his own Arms and Force, without Impeachment or Breach of that good Peace and Amity which Intervenes between His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperor:</q> And this was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed might always be a Plea in defence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation in <hi>Turky,</hi> when at any time His Majeſty provoked by the Injuries of thoſe faithleſs and piratical Nations, ſhould take due Revenge upon them, not only on the Seas, but alſo on the Land, ſubverting thoſe very Cities and Fortreſſes, which are the Neſts of Piracies, and the common Chaſtiſement and Gaols of Chriſtendom. When theſe Articles came to the hands of His Majeſties Ambaſſador the Earl of <hi>Winchelſea,</hi> with Orders to have them ratified and ſubſcribed in the manner foregoing, the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court was then at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to which place on this occaſion the Lord Ambaſſador made a Journey from his uſual Reſidence at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople;</hi> and having acquainted the <hi>Chimacam</hi> with the whole matter, and the Propoſitions rightly apprehended by him, they were offered, and the next day communicated in behalf of the Ambaſſador to the Grand Signior, who readily promiſed compliance with His Majeſties deſires, ordering the Articles and Concluſion of them, to be ingroſſed and prepared for the Imperial Aſſent. Howſoever ſome conſiderable time ran on before they were delivered out, in regard that being matters of State relating to War and Peace, they could not be fully granted without Privity and Knowledg of the Grand Vizier, who was the ſupreme Counſellor, and therefore we were forced to attend thirty five days before an Expreſs could go and return from the Frontiers with the Anſwer expected, which was as eaſily granted by the Vizier, as before it was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Grand Signior.

                     <p>The firſt was at a ſmall Village called <hi>Iſhecle,</hi> at the foot of the Mountain <hi>Ida,</hi> not far from the Ancient <hi>Iroy,</hi> now named by the <hi>Turks Kauzdog,</hi> which ſignifies the Mountain of Geeſe; the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that inhabit here, are of a rude Diſpoſition, great Thieves, and of a wild and ſavage Nature; at my entry thereupon I was adviſed by thoſe that were with me, that it was neceſſary to take Mules to carry my Baggage through the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and to preſs the People to convoy me to the next Government by Virtue of a Command the Grand Signior had granted me for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Travels; ſo that arriving at this place by break of day, I went directly with all my Attendance, being about eighteen or nineteen Horſe, to the <hi>Kadi</hi>'s Houſe, where knocking hard at the Door, a Servant looked out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and ſpying ſo great a company, wholly affrighted, ran to his Maſter, and awakening him with ſuch dreadful news, he had ſcarce any Soul or Life remaining to render an Anſwer; for he was one of thoſe, who three times a day was uſed to take his Doſe of <hi>Opium,</hi> which gave him a ſtrange kind of Intoxication or Drunkenneſs; during the Operation of which, men have their Spirits violently moved and agitated, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it leaves them ſo wearied and languid, that in the morning when they firſt awake, they remain like dead Stocks, their Members are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed, and can ſcarce turn from one ſide to the other. In this conidtion the News of new Gueſts ſurprized this <hi>Kadi,</hi> when wholly feeble he called to his Servant to reach him his Box of <hi>Opium,</hi> of which when he had taken his uſual Propotion, and that it began to work, his Life returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to him and he began immediately to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo that he had Courage to open his Gates and receive us in: when he had read the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and found no hurt in it, the Man was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with Joy and <hi>Opium,</hi> and was ſo kind, chearful, and of a good humour, that I could not but admire at the change; he told me, that he lived in a barbarous Country, and was ſorced to uſe that for Divertiſement and as a Remedy of his melancholly hours. I eaſily perceived the effect it had upon him, for he ſeemed to me like a Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam; in which humour he called all his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about him, and after a wiſe Conſultation, they provided me with two Mules, and five Men on foot with ruſty Muskets without Powder or Shot, to guide and guard me through the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. I had not travelled two Miles before all my Guard were ſtollen aſide, and taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Woods and Mountains, were fled from me, ſo that I found my ſelf with no other than my own People, in an unbeaten Path, and a way unfrequented; the man excepted who drove the Mules, who for ſake of his Beaſts was obliged to a farther attendance. We travelled in this manner through the Mountains about four hours, when near a Village called <hi>Suratnee,</hi> we met one of the Principal men on Horſe-back, carrying a flead Mutton behind him, which upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we diſcovered to be carried for a Bribe to the <hi>Kadi</hi> of <hi>Iſheclee,</hi> that ſo he would be his Friend, and favour him in his Cauſe: And further upon inquiry, finding that our Entertainment was likely to be mean at <hi>Suratnee,</hi> we forced the Gentleman to return with us, and to ſell us his Mutton at the market-price, and ſo for that time we diſappointed our <hi>Kadi</hi> of his Fee or Reward: and being upon the riſe of a Hill deſcending to <hi>Suratnee,</hi> ſo that the People could ſee us at a diſtance, they like true Sons of <hi>Kauz-dog</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their Habitations, and fled, which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving poſted after them, and catched two of their men, whom we brought under Shart, (or the Country-mans Oath, which they account very ſacred, and will by no means break) to be true and faithful to us, to ſerve, and not leave us for ſo long time as we ſhould remain in their Village, and accordingly theſe men were not only ſerviceable, but diligent: ſo ſoon as they diſcovered me to be one who would pay juſtly for what I took, and was not a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Aga, or Servant of Great men who harraſs the People, and take their Service and Meat on account of free Quarter, the whole Village returned again from their places of Refuge amidſt the Woods, ſo that I neither wanted Proviſions nor Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:39539:73"/>
                     <p>Another paſſage happened unto me of better Civility and Entertainment in the Plains of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamus,</hi> where not many Miles from that Ancient City. I arrived about ſix a Clock in the Evening at certain Tents or Cots of Shepherds, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hurdles covered with Hair-cloth, lined within with a ſort of looſe Felt, a ſufficient defence againſt the Sun and Rain; the <hi>Turks</hi> call theſe People <hi>Euruchs,</hi> and are Shepherds who with their Wives, Children and Cattel, Live and Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, where they moſt delight, or like the Shepherds of Ancient days, remove their dwellings to thoſe Places where they find moſt plenty of Water and Paſture. Amongſt theſe Cors ſo ſoon as I alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my Horſe, I was received and ſaluted by the Aga or Chief, with great Humanity and Kindneſs; for ſo ſoon as he underſtood who I was, and that I was imploied in publick Affairs, he preſently places me under ſome neighbouring Trces, and called for Carpets and Cuſhions to ſit on, which were more Fine and Rich, than agreed with the outward appearance of Men wholly unaccuſtomed to a City-life. After ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe had with me, which I remember to have been very Courteous and Inquiſitive of my Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Buſineſs, he provided Provender for our Horſes, and in a ſhort time ordered Bread and Eggs to be brought for to ſtay my Stomach, ſuppoſing that hard Travels had ſharpened my Appetite. About an hour after that, he invited all my Company, and then we fed very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully of ſeveral Diſhes, which the good Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives had dreſſed within the Precincts of their poor Tents; whilſt the Shepherds had in the Field killed a lat Kid, and were then roaſting it whole at the ſuel of a Tree which they had fell'd; this Roaſt-meat they cut into quarters, and with Bread and Salt put it into a Linen-cloth, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to one of my Servants for our Breakfaſt the next morning. Having thus well refreſhed my ſelf with the Charity of theſe good Shepherds, I aroſe with the Moon about eleven a Clock at Night; but before my Departure, I demanded what I had to pay; to which the generous Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd replied, That my Acceptance was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Payment, for that all Men were obliged to be Civil and Hoſpitable to Men who travelled the World like me for publick Service; and withal deſired me to ſpeak well, whereſoever I came, of ſuch poor Men who led their Lives in the Fields, who were inſtructed in theſe Principles, <hi>viz.</hi> to hurt none, and to be humane and helpful to all Mankind.</p>
                     <p>In a few days after my Arrival at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> I imbarked on the <hi>Bonaventure</hi> Frigat, Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Capt. <hi>Berkeley,</hi> afterwards Sir <hi>William Berke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and ſhaping our courſe firſt for <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tripoli.</note> we came to Anchor before the Town the <hi>29;</hi> and immediately going aſhore, we were conducted to the Preſence of the Paſha of that Country, whom I acquainted with the occaſion of this Addreſs, delivering into his hands two Copies of the late Treaty of Peace, one confirmed by the Hand and Seal of His Majeſty our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and the other of the Sultan; both which he received with ſingular Reſpect and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, promiſing to maintain the Peace ſacred and inviolable; and ſo being diſmiſſed fairly from him, we ſpeedily repaired on Board, and ſetting Sail again that Night with a proſperous Gale, we anchored in the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Tunis</hi> on the ſecond of <hi>September;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tunis.</note> and the next day being landed, we in the firſt place made our Addreſſes to the <hi>Dey,</hi> who bears the Office of Prince or Governor in chief, tho in the <hi>Arabian</hi> Language the word ſignifies as much as Uncle, to whom I tendred the Confirmations of Peace in the ſame form and manner as before at <hi>Tripoli:</hi> the <hi>Dey</hi> received them with Reſpect and Honour, promiſing to continue the Peace; that part which was from our King, he received himſelf; but that which was from the Grand Signior he adviſed me to deliver to the Paſha; for coming from his Maſter, it might more nearly concern him than any other; the Paſha having ſeen and read, the Hatteſheriff returned it again to the <hi>Dey</hi> to be placed amongſt the Records and Regiſters of the Divan, and ſo making a Viſit to all the great Men in Power, giving them notice of our Buſineſs, that ſo none might take Exceptions, or judg themſelves neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected for want of Addreſſes; we the ſame Night departed from <hi>Tunis,</hi> and proceeded forward in our Voyage to <hi>Algier.</hi> But before we arrive there, I have time to acquaint the Reader of the Peſtilential Fever which then affected our whole Ship. When we departed from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> we had fourteen Sick of the Autumnal Diſtemper, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ten Days, we had ninety five out of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty Men, which lay Sick on their Beds and Hamocks; and we ſeared ſo general a Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that we ſhould not have had Strength ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have Sailed our Ship; for I think there was ſcarce any amongſt us in perfect Health. But God ſhewed his Strength in our Weakneſs, ſo that in ten Days, having buried nine of our Men, he was pleaſed with the change of our Climate, to renew our Health, and in Anſwer to our Prayers, as it were by a Miracle, to reſtore us to all the Health, and Strength, and Comfort, that we could deſire.</p>
                     <p>At <hi>Algier,</hi> that Den of Thieves, and Harbour of Faithleſs Men, and all Impiety, we arrived the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> where immediately with aſſiſtance of the Conſul, we deſigned to tender the Confirmations of the Peace unto the Divan, then the ſupreme and Abſolute Power. But whilſt we imagined the Peace firm, and improbable that thoſe Articles which were concluded and agreed but the laſt Year, ſhould ſo eaſily and ſoone be forgotten; we found the Scene of Affairs greatly altered, and fears of an unexpected Rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for the Ships of <hi>Algier</hi> roving in the Seas, had lately ſent in nine ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Paſs from the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> for want of which, they pretended by a new Agreement they ought to be prize; of which, ſix by means of the Conſul being releaſed, three only remained under Detention at our Arrival; when immediately we applied our ſelves to <hi>Shaban</hi> Aga, a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Renegado, then Cape or Chief of their confuſed Divan; to him we firſt diſcloſed the import of our Meſſage, and ſhewed the Confirmations of our Peace ſubſcribed by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Grand Signior. After he had read them, a Divan was called, and the Confirmations openly publiſhed; at which time it was aſſented and agreed, that the Articles ought to be maintained, and the Peace continued; but to have this eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by firm Authority, it was farther referred to the Great Divan, which is a Grand Aſſembly of the People, who uſually meet together every <hi>Saturday</hi> of the Week. In the mean time, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had an Acquaintance formerly with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha of this Place, ſent hither by the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, we were deſirous to make him a Viſit, the better to diſcover in what nature they Honour and own the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port; but before we could be admitted to his Preſence, we were obliged to demand Licenſe of the Divan, which they granted with ſome unwillingneſs, and with the caution of two or three Witneſſes of our Diſcourſe. We were ſcarce welcomed into the Room, and the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:39539:73"/>Salutations paſſed, before we were interrupted by the Officers, and not ſuffered to proceed; ſo little eſteem they made of the Paſha, to whom not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding they allowed twelve thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a Year for his Maintenance, ſo as to carry the fair and ſpecious outſide at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, of receiving a Paſha from thence; but were ſo far from permitting him to intermeddle in the Government that they confined him like a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner not ſuffering him to ſtir Abroad without Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Conſent of the Divan, and that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeldom, tho he often pleaded his Health was much impaired by his Reſtraint, and craved Enlargement, rather for neceſſity than his Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The Day of the great Divans Aſſembly being come, the Confirmations of the Peace was again read, and well approved, and ſo laid up in the Repoſitory of their Writings; and promiſe made us for Releaſement of our Ships. But let us now obſerve the levity and unſteadineſs of this popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government; for being the day following appointed to receive our diſpatches,<note place="margin">The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at <hi>Algier.</hi>
                        </note> and diſcharge of the three Ships; there aroſe unexpectedly at the Divan, certain Scruples and Jealouſies amongſt them, which immediately quaſhed all our Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, and inſtead of confirming the Peace, produced a War. For the Divan being met, they were afraid to releaſe the Ships, leſt the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who had ſent them in, being then abroad, ſhould call them to queſtion for it at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; and not to releaſe them, might be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a War; which not ſucceeding accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſire, the cauſers thereof might be called into queſtion, and puniſhed for it; of which ſtill remained the freſh memory of late Examples. In this <hi>Dilemma</hi> of their Affairs, they reſolved to make the Act herein, to be of general and publick Aſſent; and to that end they Aſſembled a Grand Divan, calling the Captains of Ships and Gallies, then in Fort, unto their Council; who without Heſitation, or queſtioning other Matters, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships were lawful Prize; and that it was no longer requiſite to maintain the ſecond Article of freeing Strangers Goods on <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels; it neither being the deſign nor intereſt of <hi>Algier,</hi> to benefit all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom by their Peace with <hi>England:</hi> this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was followed by the whole Rabble of the Divan, with cry and noiſe; to which the wiſer ſort, notwithſtanding our Plea, and Reaſons to the contrary, which laſted for full two hours, were forced to condeſcend, and concur in the ſame Vote. Howſoever by Importunity, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the force of Reaſon, which in the moſt blind and obſcure minds of Men, hath ſomething of forcible Violence; we obtained the releaſe of the three Ships, upon diſcharge of the Strangers Goods, and payment of their Freight. But the ſecond Article of Peace, forbidding the ſearch of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships for Strangers Eſtates, or their Perſons, was declared null, and no longer to be maintained; nor the Peace likewiſe, unleſs His Majeſty would accept it upon that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to which end, they wrote this following Letter.</p>

The end of the Month</hi> Sefar, 1074. <hi>which was then in the Month of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1633.</p>
                     <p>In this manner a ſecond War broke forth in the ſpace of two Years, by which a Perſon may judg of the inconſtancy and unſteady humour of this People; who but three days before, gave us all the evidence of fair Correſpondence and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and it is probable, that when they entered the Divan, they came not with Reſolutions or Thoughts of War; however accidents and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Diſcourſes each with other, following the cry and humour of ſome rude Savage Perſon, which leads the reſt, carried all things with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence towards a Breach: So that by what preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from theſe following Reaſons, it may be concluded impoſſible to maintain a firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace with this People.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe theſe People are compoſed of the worſt Sort or Scum of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and worſt of Chriſtians, which are Renegadoes, who have renounced God and their Country, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of People who have no Religion, nor Honour; Peace cannot be longer expected or maintained, than fear or intereſt enjoins them to compliance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Government of <hi>Algier</hi> being popular, and in the hands of a vile Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who are ignorant Perſons, guided by no Rules or Principales; unſteady in all their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, not reſolving or conſulting any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter the Divan, do commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that Reſolution, which they perceive to be carried on with the greateſt noiſe; and therefore are a People not capable of Peace or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, This irrational Commonalty is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by a heady Soldiery, who are only then affrighted into a Peace, whilſt a ſtronger force compels them into good Manners. But when that Power and Puniſhment is withdrawn, they again harden their hearts like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and then when the Temptation of rich Merchant-men preſents it ſelf, their natural Inclination to Piracy returns, and their Covetouſneſs again prevails, an then they curſe the Peace, and the makers of it, and without remorſe break their Articles, and their Faith, having neither Honour nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to reſtrain them. Wherefore unleſs the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:39539:74"/>Heads of the chief Cauſers of the War he given in ſatisfaction, or Money paid for the expence, and Hoſtages given for ſecurity of it, it can never be expected that a laſting Peace ſhould be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this People; the Proof of which, hath been made appear by the ſequel of affairs, and by thoſe Wars which have enſued ſince this time. And now let us return to the Wars in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and become Spectators of thoſe Tranſactions, which were then the general Concernment of the Eaſtern and Weſtern World.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>WE leſt the Grand Vizier on his March to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the parts of <hi>Hungary,</hi> with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as computed, to conſiſt of Eighty Thouſand fighting men, and of about Seventy Thouſand deſigned for Pioniers and other neceſſary ſervices of the Army. In this march the Vizier out of deſign to ſlacken the warlike Preparations of the Chriſtians,<note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires a Treaty to amuſe the Chriſtians.</note> and to diſcover the inclinations of the Emperor to Peace, deſired a Treaty, that if poſſible, matters might be reduced to terms of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. The Reſident of <hi>Germany,</hi> was then in the Army, but he, not being impowered ſingly for any ſuch Treaty, the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> then with <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha at <hi>Temeſwar,</hi> was ſent for, and being arrived, were both called into the Viziers Tent at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to whom it was propoſed, That in Caſe the Emperor deſired a Peace, he ſhould reſign into the hands and poſſeſſion of the Sultan <hi>Zekelhyd, Zatmar, Clauſenburg,</hi> alias <hi>Coloſvar,</hi> with the late built Fort of Count <hi>Serini,</hi> without which, no Sacrifice could appeaſe the anger, and give a ſtop to the progreſs of the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Arms. Whilſt theſe Propoſitions by Poſt were diſpatched to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Vizier proceeded in his Journey to <hi>Strigonium,</hi> now called <hi>Gran,</hi> to which placer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixteen Days time, the Meſſenger returned with an Anſwer from the Emperor, which ſhowed an inclination towards an acceptance of Peace on the terms propoſed, but with inſtructions to his Miniſters to moderate by their diſcreet manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (what was poſſible) the rigour of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. For by reaſon of the diſaffection of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> whom the Emperor had lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted by demoliſhing ſeveral of their Churches, and diſcountenancing the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion which they profeſſed; and by reaſon of the Phlegm of the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> whom diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent intereſts made ſlow and unactive in their preparations againſt the common Enemy; the Emperor was wholly unprovided to oppoſe the viloence of this over-flowing Torrent, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an unequal match for the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Force. The <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving that the <hi>Germans</hi> began to condeſcend, and yield to any conditions, which might purchaſe their quiet,<note place="margin">This Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute was paid by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to Sultan <hi>So lyman.</hi>
                        </note> ſtarted a farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Fifty thouſand Florins of Yearly Tribute, and two Millions of Crowns for expence of the War, to be paid by the Emperor to the Sultan. Theſe proud and unexped Propoſals ſtartled not a little the Baron of <hi>Goez,</hi> who readily made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he clearly perceived now, that there were no intentions to a Peace, ſince the Vizier was pleaſed to make the matter ſo difficult and impoſſible, for that it were as eaſy to bring Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to meet, as his Maſter to meet the G Signior in the Conceſsion of this particular. Theſe extravagant demands a wakened the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Court, who now obſerving the <hi>Turks</hi> without their Vizard, to march haſtily to ſurprize them, vigorouſly rouſed themſelves to make that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient proviſion and defence by War, which the ſtraitneſs of time permitted them: So that in the firſt place they Aſſembled a Diet at <hi>Ratisbonne,</hi> where it was reſolved to raiſe four Armies, the firſt for the Guard and defence of <hi>Moravia</hi> and <hi>Sileſia,</hi> under the Command of Count <hi>Suſa,</hi> a Native of <hi>Rochel.</hi> The ſecond under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Raimond Monteculi,</hi> for ſafety of <hi>Raab, Newhauſel,</hi> and <hi>Komorra,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Hungary.</hi> The third under Command of Count <hi>Nicholas Serini</hi> for defence of <hi>Croatia.</hi> The fourth compoſed ſolely of <hi>Hungarians,</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Palatine of that Country, which they reported to conſiſt of Thirty thouſand fighting men. Fifthly, It was ordered that all Gariſons ſhould be well provided of Victuals and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and that the Inhabitants of <hi>Vienna</hi> ſhould take into every Houſe a proviſion for a years maintenance, and ſuch as were not able at their own Coſt, were to abandon their Dwellings. And in the mean time the Villages round about were demoliſhed, to the great amazement and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the People.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> now bearing in their thoughts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but War, began to deſign and chalk out the beſt order and method for its proſecution. The principal places then in eye of the Vizier, were <hi>Raab,</hi> and <hi>Komorra,</hi> Fortreſſes of conſiderable ſtrength, maintained and defended by Souldiers of known proweſs and conduct, and provided equally with all ſorts of Ammunition and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, agreeable to ſuch conſiderable Bulwarks and Walls, not only of the <hi>German</hi> Empire but (I may ſay) of all Chriſtendom <hi>Raab.</hi> called by the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Komorra.</note> 
                        <hi>Komorra</hi> is a ſtronger Fortreſs, erected in an Iſland of the River <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> called after the ſame name, which hath often been attempted by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but with ill ſucceſs; at both which places I have perſonally been, and viewed them with much delight. Wherefore the Vizier conſidering the ſtrength. and difficulty of theſe places, reſolved to take due and mature conſideration before he engaged himſelf in any enterprize, and to that end aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together in Conſultation with him the moſt ancient and grave men, that were Natives of the Country; ſome of theſe being ſuch who had lived in <hi>Rab,</hi> been Slaves there,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> deliberate of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to be uſed in War.</note> and had well marked and obſerved the ſtrength of that Fortreſs both as to Nature and Art, aſſured the Vizier, That the Work was immenſe, difficult, and dangerous, and not to be accompliſhed in the ſpace of one Summer; and that the Winters in that Countrey were very cold and rigid, and ill agreeing with the temperament of the Aſiatick Souldiery. The Vizier, though the farther conſidered that his Souldiers were as yet young and unexperienced, and that a foyl encountred at the firſt Enterprize, might be a diſcouragement from following the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Tract and Courſe of this War, which muſt be ſuſtained with labour and patience, and that to withdraw his Forces in the Winter would be a diſhonour to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, a blemiſh in the beginning to his own Reputation, and an encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the Enemy: Howſoever, having a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:39539:74"/>violent Ambition and Deſire to become Maſter of <hi>Rab,</hi> he could not reſt ſatisfied in this Counſel before he had conſulted with <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, and other Paſhaws of the Frontier Countries, who duly conſidering the matter as it ſtood, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſame judgment that was formerly made of the difficulty of this deſign; and herein they were the more ſtrongly confirmed, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of certain <hi>Hungarians,</hi> whom ſome parties of Horſe, under the Command of <hi>Ali</hi> Paſha, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſallying out near the Walls of <hi>Rab,</hi> had ſurprized and taken, who being brought bound before the Vizier, related, That the Town was well provided with all ſorts of Ammunition and Proviſions, and the Gariſon reinforced by Count <hi>Montecuculi</hi> with ſupply of four Thouſand men, and in this manner reported the Work as difficult as the <hi>Turks</hi> of the Countrey had formerly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. This relation confirmed by ſo many hands, diverted the Viz er from this Deſign: for before that time imagining it a place which might eaſily be ſubdued, he propoſed to himſelf, without any interruption, a clear and undiſturbed March to the Gates of <hi>Vienna,</hi> which he ſwallowing alſo in his thoughts, hoped by his own ſucceſs to repair the ſhame of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s flight from the Walls of that City, and beſides the glory of forcing the Emperor from his Imperial Seat, he ſhould atone for the ſin of the <hi>Ottomon</hi> Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, and be the firſt who undertook to mend the actions, and outvie the proweſs of the moſt magnificent, and moſt ſucceſsful of their Sultans. But the Ambition of this grand deſign giving way to neceſſity, and to thoſe other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments which obſtructed it,<note place="margin">New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel</note> after due and mature Conſultation, <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> called by the <hi>Hungariaus Oywar,</hi> was fixed upon as the place to be firſt attempted, and held up to the eye of the Souldiery, as the reward and prize of their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and hazard. Wherefore Boats were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and Planks, and Timbers for a Bridge to paſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> in a few days, according to their uſual expeditions, had raiſed; ſo that the Army both Horſe and Foot began to tranſport themſelves as faſt as was poſsible to the other ſide, but the multitudes crouded over in that diſorder and haſte, that Three or four Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men had ſcarce paſſed the River before the Bridge was ſo broken and ſhattered that ſome time was neceſſarily required to repair it, before the reſt of the Army durſt adventure to follow their Companions.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:39539:78"/>that he ſeemed not only to exceed every Court in particular, but in Elegance and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence to equalize them all together. Upon Debate of matters in reference to this War, the Count of <hi>Olack</hi> was unanimouſly choſen General for the Confederates of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but the more hot diſputes between the Proteſtants and Papiſts about Election of other Generals kept matters in longer ſuſpence; yet at length the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden</hi> was choſen Marſhal General in behalf of the League, the Marqueſs of <hi>Durlach,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Munſter</hi> his Councellours, and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; of the War;<note place="margin">The ſtrength of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</note> and Count <hi>Francis Fucher,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Ordnance.

For the Bridge of <hi>Oſek</hi> was againſt the common opinion again rebuilt, planked, and compleated with new Timbers in the ſpace of forty days, many hands making light work; which when firſt founded, was the work of ſix years: which Expedition was the more remarkable, in regard that this Bridge was not formed out of the Ruines of the old, nor founded on the ſame ground, but new framed out of the Woods with as much comlineſs and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as befits a Bridge of that nature and length, paſſing over a wild Marſh or Fen.

But perhaps, that Diſpleaſure which was Juſtice in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, might be Envy, and Emulation in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who beholding with jealous Eyes his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Succeſſes the Winter before, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his Enemies, and exalted his Name to that Glory in all the Courts of Chriſtian Princes, that the Pope honoured him with Medals of Gold; the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> with the Order of the Golden Fleece; the <hi>French</hi> King as a Demonſtration of his Eſteem, with a Token of ten thouſand Crowns; and Cardinal <hi>Francis Barberini,</hi> with a Penſion of eight hundred Crowns a Month; and all other <hi>European</hi> Princes, at leaſt made the moſt part Applications to him by Congratulatory Letters, admiring his Virtues, and applauding his Succeſſes; permitting their Gazets and Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Weekly to divulge and publiſh his Praiſes. From whence may rationally be collected, the true occaſion of that Envy, which by cold aſſiſtances, and ſlow ſuccors, obſtructed as well the taking of <hi>Kaniſia,</hi> as the valiant defence of <hi>Serinſwar,</hi> which was decryed, not only as a Fort erected without due and matue Conſideration, but without art, or regular Proportions, which might render it tenable; accuſing at the ſame time as well the Raſhneſs and Temerity of <hi>Serini</hi>'s Counſels, as his want of Judgment and Experience in Military Affairs.</p>

For theſe are they, who lately in cool Blood againſt the Laws of Arms and Nations, unhumanely butchered our Countrymen and Kindred, and made no difference between Captives of War, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors; but like Thieves and Murderers, ſentenced brave Men to Death, who had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther crime, than that they unhappily fought in defence of their Country.

At which formidable ſight, the Chriſtians collecting their Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, retreated to a more ſpacious place, where might be open Field ſufficient for both Armies to draw up and join Battel.

                     <p>And here is juſt occaſion for us to doubt, why <hi>Montecuculi</hi> ſhould be thus admired and loaded with Honours, whilſt the ſervices of <hi>Serini</hi> and <hi>Soiſe</hi> were ſo far from being taken notice of, that they ſeemed to effect the diſgrace and ruine of theſe Worthies, rather than to produce the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their Prince, and the applauſe of their Country, the natural Rewards of Valour and Virtue. And indeed I cannot but confeſs, I my ſelf have wondred, when in the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> I have heard the Actions and Zeal of <hi>Serini</hi> ſo ſlightly ſpoken of, or contemned, when a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger took the liberty but to deſcant on his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to vent any thing which but ſavoured of his commendations. The reaſon of which, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to aſſign unto two cauſes.

                        <note place="margin">Reaſons why the Services of <hi>Montecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culì</hi> were accepted better than thoſe of <hi>Serini.</hi>

The ſecond is, the fury of <hi>Serini</hi> and <hi>Soiſe,</hi> whoſe zeal without conſideration of irritating the <hi>Turk,</hi> or fear of moving the paſſion of the Lyon beyond the terms of an eaſie pacification, tranſported them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all damage and ruine, which are the juſt concomitants of War; which rage ſeemed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver violent to the Court at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and not to ſuit with the preſent Policy of the War, which was deſigned to be carried on rather in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive than in an offenſive poſture; imagining per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that the good nature of the <hi>Turk</hi> might be complemented into Peace, and that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and generoſiry might have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon them, as it had upon <hi>Saul,</hi> when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> had his life at his mercy, and yet ſpared him: according to which counſels of the Court, <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> ſquaring every particular of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereunto adding ſucceſs, mounted on the wings of Fame, and had his Glory celebrated without diminutions; but the hot and zealous temper of <hi>Serini,</hi> which Souldier-like underſtood nothing but down-right blows, knew not how to uſe that moderation and caution, which the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Court judged an ingredient ſo requiſite to the prudent management of the preſent War, that he was eſteemed uncapable of command, who had not diſcretion enough to practice it: And this was the true reaſon that <hi>Serini</hi> was diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and that his Command was taken from him, and that his Appeal to the Court was without redreſs: Howſoever in regard that the Fame he had won carried him high in the eſteem of all Chriſtendom, he was entertained with hopes and fair promiſes; and even after the very Sattel of <hi>Rab,</hi> nothing was more commonly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed than the giving <hi>Nicholas Ser<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>This opinion was rooted with much ſuperſtition and ſtrength of fancy in the minds of the Vulgar: And the rumors in the Camp that the Vizier upon a falſe Alarm of the approach of the Enemy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Quarters, had commanded the Army to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:39539:83"/>retreat, adminiſtred fury and courage to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and fear and amazement to his own; from which errour and timidity was occaſioned that ſlaughter which enſued; on which diſcourſes and reports dangerous diſcontents daily increaſing in the hearts of the ſouldiery, it is thought they would have vented their paſſion and revenge on their General, had he not at a publick Aſſembly of all the Heads and Commanders of the Army cleared himſelf freely, by charging the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of all upon the Grand Signior, having acted nothing but with Authority of the Imperial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; promiſing with as much ſpeed as honour and ſafety would permit, by agreement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Peace, to bring the War to a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.

So that at length it was reſolved to unite the ſhattered Forces of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by Count <hi>Suſa,</hi> to the Army of the Vizier, and attend to ſecure <hi>Oywar</hi> or <hi>Newhauſel</hi> with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Ammunition, and Reinforcement of that Gariſon, whereby this War might conclude with ſome Trophies of advance, and inlargement of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Borders, which in all their Wars is the deſign and Maxime of the <hi>Turks.</hi> So that marching thither, they gathered and collected all the Proviſions poſſible, and having ſupplied the Gariſon, they returned again to <hi>Strigonium</hi> with all expedition, retaining ſtill impreſſions of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror from the late ill ſucceſs. And that they might march with leſs impediment, they ſent their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery and heavy Baggage down the <hi>Danube:</hi> Such was the fear of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army at preſent, that it is ſuppoſed, had the Chriſtians eagerly purſued their Victory, they had not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the whole <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Force with little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but alſo without any impediment marched to the very Walls of <hi>Buda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what infatuation ſoever blinded the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Counſels, little or no advantage was taken, as if the deſign of the Emperor had only been to repel the Enemy from his Borders, or that he feared to irritate the <hi>Turks</hi> with a too invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and pertinacious proſecution of his Victories-Inſtead of which, the Vizier making ſome Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Peace, and evidencing the realty of his intentions by his Preſents of a Veſt of Sables, and a Horſe richly furniſhed, with which he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and careſſed the <hi>German</hi> Reſident, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were accepted and embraced at <hi>Vienna</hi> with much greedineſs, and the Peace almoſt wholly concluded and clapped up in a moment, to the aſtoniſhment of the whole World.<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to Peace.</note> But as matters of this nature cannot ſucceed without juſt and due conſiderations, ſo on both ſides cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cauſes concurred which inclined and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed things to an accommodation. For on the <hi>Turks</hi> part there wanted not ſuch in the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Court, who emulous of the Grand Viziers fortune and charge, endeavoured to remove him from the favour of his Prince, by accuſing him in many particulars of negligence, and impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the conduct of his Affairs. To anſwer which, his return with the Olive-branch of Peace in his mouth, and yet the Laurels of Conqueſt on his head, having added ſo conſiderable a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs as <hi>Newhauſel</hi> to the Dominions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and demoliſhment <hi>Serinſwar,</hi> the Original cauſe of the War, were a ſufficient conviction of the evil accuſations of his Adverſaries, and an argument irreſiſtible, when inforced by the Authority of his own Preſence.

                     <p>On theſe Terms (of which none ſeems diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantageous to the Chriſtian Intereſt, unleſs the fourth Article, the diſhonour of which ſeems to be covered with the name of <hi>Apafi,</hi> though the ſcore was paid by the Emperor) the Peace was eſtabliſhed, and the Vizier, as a beginning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gave liberty to many Chriſtian Captives; ſome whereof were of Quality, and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made through all the Confines for a Ceſſation of Arms. Howſoever, ſome petty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters remained undecided, which were deferred until the Arrival of an extraordinary Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, who was to exchange with the <hi>Turks</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ambaſſadour in the Month of <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in the mean time ſuſpenſion of Arms, and all other Hoſtilities was confirmed. At which News all ſorts of People amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> were greatly rejoyced, and the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof the more welcome, by how much the more unexpected. Whereby we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the alteration of that ancient Martial diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, which was natural to this Empire, which whilſt it was exerciſed in War, grew hardy, active and inured to warlike exerciſe, but now through idleneſs and want of War (except the <hi>Venetian,</hi> which affords the Soldiery no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable employment) their minds became reſty, wearied with one year and a halfs labour, and dejected with the unproſperous ſucceſs of one Summer.</p>
                     <p>But what Conſiderations ſoever the Emperor might have to conclude this Peace,<note place="margin">The <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> oppoſe the Peace.</note> the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> were highly diſſatisfied with it, becauſe it was founded on their proper loſs; and that <hi>Newhauſel</hi> was given for a price of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quiet, which none but themſelves paid
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:39539:84"/>and yet all <hi>Germany</hi> enjoyed the benefit. That that Town was an appendage to the Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to which the Emperour having on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the claim (as they pretended) of an Elective Prince, could not diſmember any part without conſent of the States thereof; and this poſition they maintained with that heat and fury, that they declared themſelves diſobliged from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Articles, reſolving to vindicate their own right in deſpight of all oppoſition whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and that ſince the Emperour had undertaken their Protection, he was bound to aſſert their freedom, and defend their Cities, even with the expence of his own Treaſury, and at the hazard of his own hereditary Poſſeſſions. But to theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant Demands, the Emperours Council reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with theſe following reaſons and moderation; That they themſelves were the firſt Beginners and Promoters of this War; That His Majeſty at their inſtance and requeſt condeſcended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them as Subjects, not only with draining of his own Exchequer, and Blood of his Patrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Dominions, but with the charge of hired and mercenary Strangers. In the mean time what aſſiſtance had the Hungarians brought to this War, or to their own defence? What Contributions did they ever make? What Forces did they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unite in the Field by a general aſſent of their whole Kingdom? Notwithſtanding his Majeſty was ready to continue the War, could they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves propoſe either a ſafe way for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of it, or that the preſent Conjuncture did not offer honourable Conditions of a happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. Moreover,<note place="margin">The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors Reaſons for a Peace.</note> That the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Uncle, and Father in Law, being aged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit, leaving no other Heir than an infirm and ſickly Child, to ſupport the charge and weight of all his Kingdoms, it was requiſite that at ſuch a time as this, he ſhould be free from all incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances, either to aſſiſt the Infant in Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, or to aſſert his own Rights (if ſo it ſhould pleaſe God) in the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. And that now, ſince a Treaty was on foot for Election of a Succeſſor to the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> it was neceſſary for his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to bear his part in that Tranſaction; but above all, it was conſiderable, That the common Enemy being Rich and Powerful, God had ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to put his Victory into their Hands to no other end than to improve it unto a Peace, which being at this time neglected, the beſt that could enſue would be the miſeries of War, which turning on the inconſtant Wheel of Fortune with variety of ſucceſſes, is always attended with Slaughter, Captivity, Fire, Sword, and a thouſand other Calamities. Theſe, and ſuch like reaſons, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated and mollified the exaſperate ſpirits of the Hungarians, ſo that they ſeemed to aquieſce and be ſatisfied, and making a Vertue of Neceſſity, had patience where there was no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</p>
                     <p>The ſudden News of this unexpected Peace did in like manner affect the French King, and the States of the Empire, judging it unreaſonable for them to be intereſſed in the War, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the Concluſion of the Peace. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, things being well repreſented, and as well received and underſtood; his Moſt Chriſtian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty accepted of the Reaſons as juſt and ſatisfactory. In the mean time the French had a free liberty to make choice of their Winter Quarters,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> Army march home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> which they fixed upon in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> but their King being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to burden the Country with his Souldiers for a longer time than they were ſerviceable to them, he ordered them to march, and quarter in <hi>Alſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> but before their departure the Emperour honoured Monſieur <hi>de Coligni</hi> with his Picture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled with Diamonds, and the other Officers with Gold Chains and Medals; ordering the Troops not to march above ten miles a day, and every Third to be a Day of repoſe, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained all the way at ſree Quarter, ſo as to return into <hi>France</hi> jocund and healthy, as they departed thence. But before they would bid adieu to thoſe Countries, the General and Officers paid their Viſit to Count <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas Serini,</hi> preſenting him with a Horſe, Furniture, and Piſtols, as a ſmall Tribute to that Great Captain, whoſe Fame was cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated through the whole World; ingenuouſly confeſſing, That the rumour of his name ſtruck more amazement and terrour in the Enemy, than the Armies that actually faced them, and was more inſtrumental in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Victory on the Banks of <hi>Rab,</hi> than their weapons or courage which fought againſt them. But not long after this worthy Heroe <hi>Serini</hi> hunting one day ſeparated from the reſt of his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants in the Thickets of a Wood, behold, on a ſudden was ſurprized by the ruſhing forth of a wild Boar, which raging, and made furious by ſome Wounds he had received, firſt ſtruck him in the Knee, with which falling to the ground, the fierce Beaſt not giving him leiſure to recover himſelf, ganched him again in the head with his broad Tusk,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Serini</hi>'s Death.</note> which proved ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, that in a ſhort time he expired in the Arms of one of his Pages. This was the end of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Captain, who unconquered in many and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled Conflicts of his Enemies, was made the prey of an ignoble Beaſt. Such are the ſecret and occult Providences of Heaven, which men interpret or reflect on as they are governed by prejudice or intereſt. And ſo did the <hi>Turks</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the Fall of this their Grand Adverſary to the righteouſneſs of their Religion, and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Cauſe; as if he had been a Perſon unworthy to dye by the hand of a man, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be executed by that Beaſt, which is moſt abominated and deteſted by the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Rites.<note place="margin">The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Sirini.</hi>
                        </note> He was a Perſon as mortal an Enemy to the <hi>Turks,</hi> as ever <hi>Hannibal</hi> was to the <hi>Romans;</hi> in Dangers moſt couragious, in War valiant, and patient of labour; in Peace courteous, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in his pleaſures; his Diet was natural, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than artificial; in Banquets, or Drinking Meetings, after the faſhion of that Country, was ſparing in Wine, and rather abſtemious than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate; Muſick and Dances were the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the ſofter and effeminate part of his Court, rather than his own Paſtimes, whoſe Recreations were chiefly in the Woods, and in ſuch Huntings as had ſomething in them of ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude with Martial Exerciſes; his Judgment was profound and deep, and yet his familiar Diſcourſe facetious; his Converſation obliging, his humour affable, and yet ſevere and majeſtick; he ſpake much, and yet well; his diſpoſition was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and generous, eſpecially to his Soldiers, whom he never reſtrained or defrauded of their Booty and Prey, but contented every one with a juſt and exact Diviſion. In ſhort, he was one of thoſe zealous Champions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cauſe, who in the Chronicles of paſt Ages ought to be placed and numbred amongſt the worthieſt Heroes.</p>
                     <p>The Winter now approaching, and a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in all appearance made of the War, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier returned to <hi>Belgrade,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier ſends for his Mother to <hi>Belgrade.</hi>
                        </note> deſigning to remain there until the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadour had entered the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> borders, and in the mean time ſent for his Mother thither, pretending that in an
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:39539:85"/>uncertain and changeable eſtate the Maternal Bleſſing is of higheſt Conſolation, it being eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pious amongſt the Turks for a man to dye at the Feet of his Mother. This Mother of his was eſteemed a cunning or wiſe Woman, by whoſe Charms and Incantations his Father and he were ſuppoſed long to have conſerved the Office of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier; and as my own Ears can witneſs, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers Diſcourſe, That his Mothers Art conſiſted much in Philtrums and Charms, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling affection and friendſhip, and had a power over the Grand Signiors Inclinations and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, rendring all things and actions the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier had performed in this War full of merit and admiration. This I ſay was the Diſcourſe of ſome common Soldiers.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>December,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star.</note> that Blazing-ſtar which appeared formidably to moſt parts of the known World, was alſo ſeen within the Turkiſh Empire, not without a general terrour of all, as prognoſticating diſaſters of Sword, Peſtilence, and Famine; and ſet the Turkiſh Aſtrologers at work to find out the myſtery it portended: from whoſe Art moſt commonly was divined the death of ſome great Perſon in the Empire, which ſome would have to be the Grand Signior, othes the Viſier; others both, as they deſired alteration and change of Government.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior continued all this time at <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes.</note> taken up with an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleaſure in his Court there, with which his averſion to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſo much increaſed, that he could not endure ſo much as the name of the place: and if accidentally in his Hunting (as it reported) he chanced to fall into the road which led thither, and remembring himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, would immediately turn thence, as one that corrects himſelf of ſome deſperate errour, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voids a path which tends to an evitable deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Kadeleſcher and the other grave Judges of the Law obſerving this unreaſonable hatred of their Prince to his Imperial Seat, conſidered how prejudicial it was to him and his People to have a City of that renown, antiquity, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of living, deſpiſed and abandoned: and that perhaps the Souldiery now upon their March from the War, might be impatient of returning home, as all the Dependants on the <hi>Divan,</hi> and Perſonages of great Quality, deſired to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Habitations and Gardens at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> from which diſcontents on all ſides it was concluded, That there might reſult dangerous Seditions and Mutinies, and therefore reſolved (and as ſome ſay alſo at the inſtigation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier) to proſtrate themſelves before the Grand Signior, and tender him their opinions and ſence in that particular, which they accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming and aſſigning the Kadeleſcher, or the Chief Juſtice with all humility to be their Mouth in this Petition, their counſel was received with that indignation, that they were chaſed from the Grand Signiors preſence with fury and high diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, and the Kadeleſcher at that moment deprived of his Office.</p>
                     <p>To theſe other extravagances the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior would have added another of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and cruelty, by cauſeleſly putting to death his Brother <hi>Solyman,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſeeks to deſtroy his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> whom all the time of his Reign, together with another Brother, he had kept Priſoner in the Seraglio: for now having a Son of his own, he conceived it more ſecure to remove all competition that might be for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, according to the example and cuſtom of the Ottoman Princes; but ſuffering ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience in the thoughts of imbruing his hands in the blood of his guiltleſs Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it more juſtifiable to perform the Fact by proceſs of Law, and to that end ſent to the Muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti for his Fetfa or Sentence, <hi>viz.</hi> That in ſuch a caſe, where there is a ſufficient proviſion for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the true Lineage of the Ottoman Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whether it may be lawful, according to their Law and ancient Preſidents, to take off ſome as ſuperfluous Suckers, that draw not only nouriſhment from the root, but endanger alſo the life of the Tree. But the Mufti was not ſo cruel or unjuſt as to paſs this Sentence, but rather ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated the Grand Signior to deſer this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for having but one Son, and that a Child, which was ſubject to the common chances of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family was not ſo ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided of Heirs, that he could paſs his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for taking away one, who was ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a reſerve and member of it; with which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Grand Signior ſuffered himſelf to be overcome, having ſome touches of Conſcience, and perhaps, not being naturally cruel, ſome ſence of compaſſion towards his innocent Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>But returning now to the Great Vizier, we find him in his Winter quarters at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> where having taken an affection to the elder Son of the Tartar <hi>Chan,</hi> or elſe having conceived ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or diſpleaſure againſt the Father,<note place="margin">The Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er offers to depoſe the Tartar <hi>Chan.</hi>
                        </note> frankly proffered to depoſe the Father, and confer the Government upon him who was the Son. But it ſeems this young <hi>Tartar,</hi> though barbarous, had yet ſo much of filial obedience and reverence inſtamped on him by nature, that he modeſtly refuſed the proffer, and immediatly diſpatched a Meſſenger with ſecret Advices to his Father. The Tartar <hi>Chan</hi> received this Intelligence with great indignation, and purpoſing to play that game in reallity with the Vizier, which he had paſſed on him only by way of overture, wrote a Letter to the Paſha of <hi>Buda,</hi> a man of great abilities and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, advertiſing him, that hearing a true and worthy character of his proweſs and wiſdom, he could not but deſire to be his friend; and that he might make demonſtrations of his being ſuch, he proffered all the intereſt he had at the Ottoman Court to promote him to the ſupreme Office of firſt Vizier. What Fate ſoever accompanied this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either from the Confidents of the Tartars, or of the Paſha, the ſubſtance of the Meſſage came to the knowledge of the Vizier, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a private Commiſſion immediately from the Grand Signior therein, ſent for the Paſha, and without farther proceſs, or evidence of proof, or accuſation, ſtruck off his Head.</p>

                     <p>The Spring being now well forward, the time of action, and the Summer at hand, the <hi>Turks</hi> remained with great expectation of the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadour; and with greater impatience, in regard that their Ambaſſadour had for ſome time continued upon the Frontiers. It was now <hi>May,</hi> and yet no news from <hi>Germany;</hi> ſo that many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt the reality of the Peace, others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on the diſhonour of the Grand Signior, in having his Ambaſſadour ſo long on the Frontiers, as if the Peace had been precarious, and deſired by the <hi>Turks:</hi> Some conſidered the preſent ill conſequences, in caſe the War ſhould break out again; for that licenſe was given to the greateſt part of the Army to return home, and all ſuch as came as far as from <hi>Babylon, Damaſcus,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> to the Frontiers in <hi>Hungary</hi> were departed;<note place="margin">Rumours of the People on occaſion of ſtay of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> and to recal theſe again, and other Zaims and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mariots from remote parts, required a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, of which their diſtreſs would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, ſhould the Chriſtians prove deceitful in their Treaty. Beſides which, reports were ſpread abroad, that the <hi>French</hi> had intercepted the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in his paſſage about <hi>Komorra,</hi> and had given an interruption to the Peace. Others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that the Ambaſſadour was dead in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> were again in Arms, as wholly diſſatisfied with the Peace. Theſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours flying about, all People blamed the facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Great Vizier in being too credulous and confident of the Faith and Morality of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and the Enemies of the Vizier more boldly adventured to accuſe his ill management of Affairs, which did not a little tickle the ambition of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha</hi> Paſha, then Captain Paſha, and Chimacam of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> ſuppoſing that all the diſgraces and ill ſucceſſes of the Vizier prepared a way for his aſcent unto that Office. And to become more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, being a man naturally of an affable and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible carriage, inſinuated himſelf into the favour and good opinion of the Great men and principal Favourites of the Seraglio, over-acting his part in ſome meaſure by condeſcenſions unbeſeeming the degree and dignity of a Chimacam,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Muſtapha</hi> Paſha's affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one day to kiſs the Veſt of the Kuzlir-Aga, too apparent a piece of adulation and meanneſs in ſo great a Subject, who in thoſe parts repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Perſon of his Maſter. Theſe paſſages were not altogether unknown to the Vizier; and though at a diſtance he could not perfectly view, and diſcover particularly the comportment of this Chimacam, yet being by converſation well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his ſubtle diſpoſition, gueſſed at his thoughts, and the reſt of his actions, and to deal with him in the ſame terms, wrote a Letter to the Grand Signior, bewailing the ill ſucceſs of the War againſt <hi>Venice,</hi> and the ill eſtate and condition of the Fleet; to repair which, and to give courage to their men, and reſtore the Diſcipline in Marine Affairs, the preſence of the Captain-paſha was neceſſary in the Fleet, who had now for Two years enjoyed the benefit and the title without perſonal attendance on that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Charge. The Grand Signior having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Letter, concurred in the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with his Vizier, and gave Orders to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam to prepare himſelf to ſerve that Summer at Sea; for that now it was neceſſary he ſhould be in Perſon there, and leſs requiſite his preſence in the City, where his Office would ſpeedily be made void by return of the Vizier. The Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam immediately in obedience to his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters command, put himſelf in a poſture for his Voyage, and in the firſt place ſent away his Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and appointed the Fleet not to depart until his farther order: Yet in the mean time ſo ſecretly and under-hand made uſe of the friendſhip of the Court-Favourites, repreſenting as from themſelves, how uſeful the ſervice and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of the Chimacam was as yet in the City, by reaſon that the delays of the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour made the Viziers return uncertain, and that this Office would ill be ſupplied by any another; they obtained licenſe for his continuance in Office, and diſappointed the intentions and deſigns of the Vizier.</p>
                     <p>About the end of <hi>May,</hi> after long expectation arrived the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadour at <hi>Buda,</hi> to the great joy of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp. I then was there my ſelf, and obſerved the general ſatisfaction at this news: ſo that now the Ambaſſadour being entred the Frontiers, and his arrival ſecured, on the Twenty ninth of <hi>May,</hi> the Vizier began his March from <hi>Belgrade</hi> with the whole Army, and I kept company with them for thirteen days. On the laſt of <hi>June</hi> the Vizier arrived within ſix hours Journey of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> intending in Two or Three days to prepare for his ſolemn Entrance. But it is reported, That the Viziers Mother had by her Art ſo affected the heart of the Grand Signior towards her Son, that he could not longer want his preſence, and therefore in the way diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequent Meſſages to him to haſten him as faſt as his convenience would permit. And bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to aſſure him of his grace and favour, ſent his young Favourite, a handſom Youth of about Twenty years of age, to meet him with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of five Horſes richly adorned and furniſhed, and to feaſt him plentifully on the way: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come within a few hours Journey, the Grand Signior could not contain his deſire of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, until the day of his Entry; but ordered him immediately to come to him, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of a private Conference. The Vizier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly obeying, and being come to the Royal Preſence, the Grand Signior kiſſed him on the ſhoulder, and honoured him with a<note n="*" place="margin">It is in the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Mace, which the <hi>Turks</hi> wear at their Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles.</note> Topooſe of Gold ſtudded with precious Stones, with a Sword, a Dagger, and a Horſe richly furniſhed, with which Regal Munificence he returned tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing to his Tents, being now fully aſſured of the real grace and conſtant favour of his Maſter. The ſecond of <hi>July</hi> the Vizier made his Entrance with ſolemn Pomp and Glory through part of the City, paſſing again into the Field to remain under Tents with the whole Camp, being ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the Grand Signior, in regard the City was neither capable to contain ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without diſpoſſeſſing the greateſt part of the Inhabitants of their Houſes, nor in this hot ſeaſon of the Year was it ſo wholeſom and cool as the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:39539:86"/>open air of the Country. Beſides, matters would be in a far greater readineſs for a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to which place the Vizier had perſwaded the Grand Signior to make a Viſit after Audience given to the <hi>German</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, whom the People now expected with wonderful impatience.</p>
                     <p>Not many days after arrived Count <hi>Leſly</hi> the Ambaſſadour Extraordinary from his <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Majeſty to the Grand Signior, who made a ſolemn Entrance into the City, paſſing firſt through the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Camp, where the Grand Signior remained, and thence to the Houſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and appointed for him at the expence of the Sultan. The Cavalcade was as followeth: In the Front of all were the Ten Chaouſes which had attended the Ambaſſadour through the whole Journey,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors Entrance.</note> theſe were followed by an Hundred fifty five other Chaouſes with Muzevege, with ſome Captains over the Janiſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour had of his own Retinue about a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Perſons on Horſe-back, well mounted, and cloathed after the <hi>Hungarian</hi> faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; his proper Guard conſiſted of Four and twenty Perſons armed with Partiſans; before him went his Trumpets, and Kettle Drums, but not ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with Two Banners of ſpread Eagles fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one of them richly embroidered, carried by a Count of the Empire. The Ambaſſadour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was cloathed with a Cloth of Silver Veſt, lined with Sables, on his Cap he wore a Feather after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> faſhion, adorned with Jewels, which they call <hi>(Sargouch)</hi> and is only uſed by the Grand Signior, and his principal Vizier; before him went Eight led Horſes richly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; immediately after him followed the Pages and Servants of the Spaheelar Agaſee, and of the Aga which conducted him from the Frontiers. Next came his Litter covered with Violet colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Velvet, and carried by Mules; then his three Coaches with ſix Horſes a piece, one of which being richly gilded, and made chearful with Glaſs Windows after the new mode, the Grand Signior became much pleaſed with it, and at his requeſt it was preſented to him: after theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed four or five other Coaches of Four Horſes, in which were Churchmen and unfirm perſons; and laſt of all came the <hi>German</hi> Wagons, and other Carts with thoſe of the Countrey with Baggage.</p>
                     <p>This Ambaſſadour was not long arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was admitted to Audience with the Prime Vizier,<note place="margin">Audience given to the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador.</note> who beſtowed on him a Veſt of Sables, with a Horſe and Furniture of conſiderable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, and a Hundred of his Retinue were veſted with Coftans, which amongſt the <hi>Turks</hi> are teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of favour and acceptance. About Four days after, the Ambaſſadour had Audience with the Grand Signior himſelf, at which were only Forty Coftans given out, which coming from ſo Grand a Perſonage, were in value multiplied much above the number given by the Vizier.</p>

                     <p>This year gave the firſt Beginning to trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Dominions, and that of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua.</hi> For in Company of the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, in condition of a private Perſon, came the Marqueſs <hi>Durazzo</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Genoua,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe</hi> make Peace with the <hi>Turk.</hi>
                        </note> with Letters from that Republick to the Grand Signior, and Great Vizier, importing their deſire of friendſhip and commerce with the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port. This deſign of opening a door to a new Trade was commenced and carried on wholly by the contrivance and power of the Family
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:39539:86"/>of the <hi>Durrazzo</hi>'s, falſly founded on the courſe allay of Money, then currant in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Territories, which proved not long durable, as will appear by the Sequel. This Marqueſs being arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> declared his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which if favourably accepted, an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour or Reſident with Merchants ſhould be ſent to hold a Trade in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions. In anſwer whereunto the Vizier replied according to the uſual complement, That the Arms of the Port are always open to thoſe who deſire to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a friendſhip and correſpondence with it. But becauſe in former days Ambaſſadours from <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> having like promiſes of admiſſion, were notwithſtanding through the union of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> obſtructed in their paſſage, and forced to return home, though one of them as far as <hi>Scio</hi> in his way, and the other as <hi>Raguſa;</hi> therefore this Marqueſs in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance hereof preſſed the Vizier farther in his promiſe, deſiring him to give him the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that what oppoſition might be made to the contrary by other Miniſters, he would yet keep firm to that word he had given to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick: The Vizier conſtantly promiſed that he would; and if any other Ambaſſadours were not pleaſed with the friendſhip and Treaty of that day, they might ſeek their remedy as they pleaſed, and if they pleaſed might have liberty to depart. The Marqueſs being ſatisfied with this aſſurance, took Letters to his Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in aſſurance thereof, and Articles were given, and Priviledges for Trade ſigned according to the Tenour of other Capitulations: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herewith diſpatched,<note place="margin">The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeſe</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> he returned home by Land, and the next year appeared again himſelf in the Perſon of Ambaſſadour Extraordinary to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court; where after high and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Preſents and great Expences made, chiefly ſupported by the Houſe of <hi>Durazzo,</hi> a Reſident was ſeated at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where we will leave them for a while, and ſome years after (God willing) take an account of the profit and loſs this progging Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had made by this Embaſſy and Trade. But before we leave this point, it will be worth our noting, how hainouſly the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour Monſieur <hi>La Haye</hi> took this entertainment of the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> in regard he was ſo concerned againſt his admiſſion, that he declared to the chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of State, how he had received Orders to oppoſe the entrance of the <hi>Genoeſe</hi> Nation, as highly prejudicial and obſtructive to their Trade; and in ſine, to acquaint the Grand Signior, that in caſe he reſolved to entertain them, his Maſter would withdraw his Ambaſſadour and Nation; and therefore they ought to conſider, whether a new Friend and an inconſiderable Republick ought to be perferred before the Known and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved acquaintance of the powerful Empire of <hi>France.</hi> But whatſoever the <hi>French</hi> Miniſters were able to act to the contrary, the <hi>Genoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> kept their ſtations, in which they were the better ſecured by thoſe frequent occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty in defence of the Chriſtian Cauſe, had given to theſe Enemies of the Chriſtian Faith</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier and the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadour being now both at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port, the Wars were concluded, and every one began to diſpoſe his affairs to a quiet and a repoſed life. But this Empire being ſtill by God's Providence in a condition of growth and augmentation, could not remain long in Peace, nor long in health without exerciſe and action. Wherefore no ſooner was <hi>Germany</hi> at eaſe, than the Viſier be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move the proſecution of the War in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> deſiring to obtain the glory of ſubjecting totally that Iſland,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> reſolve to proſecute the War in <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> which for the ſpace of Twenty five years had been the principal ſubject of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> deſign and exerciſe, and acquire to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Fame in Hiſtory of being Conquerour of <hi>Candia,</hi> and Concluder of the <hi>Venetian</hi> War. Wherefore the Vizier with ſeveral other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Perſons, aſſembled in a Garden near the City of <hi>Adrianople,</hi> ſent for the Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> Repreſentative for the Republik of <hi>Venice;</hi> where being come, at the firſt word demanded of him the Surrender of the whole Iſland of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> To which he modeſtly replied, That ſo great a gift was not in his power to give, and that his office was only to be aſſiſtant to that happy hour, wherein all matters might concur towards Peace, and that his Mediation might contribute towards a concluſion of this long and tedious War. In the mean time he ſhould acquaint his Prince with the demand the Vizier was pleaſed to make. To which the <hi>Turks</hi> added menaces, with high and inſolent words, deſigning to bend their whole force and power againſt <hi>Candia,</hi> the effect of which will hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be a material ſubject of our Hiſtory. And thus much, to my beſt remembrance, I received from the mouth of that <hi>Venetian</hi> Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time the Grand Signior, though he continued his Sports and Hunting, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the violent heats of the Summer; yet he began to entertain ſomething more of warm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards his Women, and to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to that Sex, in contemplation of his little Son, who beginning now to play and prattle, afforded him matter of entertainment in the Apartments of his Women; ſo that he affectionately doting on his Queen, gave order for increaſe of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue and Attendance,<note place="margin">The G. Signior paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately loves his Queen.</note> and appointed the beſt Artiſans of <hi>Adrianople</hi> to make her a Crown ſtudded with very precious Stones to adorn her Head, of which he was ſo impatient, that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Goldſmiths to work in the Seraglio, permitting them ſcarce time to eat or ſleep until it was finiſhed. In recompence of which affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Sultan, this Lady ſo correſponded, that ſhe appeared paſſionately in love, practiſing certain pretty tricks of ſwooning and of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie condition in his abſence, which ſo endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in all reſpects to her, that it was ſaid the Sultan kept himſelf conſtant to this Queen only, and contrary to the cuſtom of other Emperors, and permiſſion of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Laws, made uſe of the multitude of his other Women only for Slaves, or Attendants to the greater ſtate and adoration of his beloved Queen.</p>
                     <p>And now the Grand Signior, at the perſwaſion of the Vizier and others of his Council, reſolving to winter at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> certain Women of the lower rank were diſpatched before, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of the removal of the Court: And being in the Seraglio at large without obſervance and awe of their uſual Spies, two of the boldeſt Wenches finding a Cradle, wherein the Royal Infants were uſually laid, adventured to pick out the beſt Jewels, of which ſome were very good Stones, and afterwards laid it up again in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place, where it was not eaſily found. Not many days after the Queen-Mother wanting the Cradle of ſo much value and antiquity, where many of the young Sultans had lain, ſent to the Seraglio at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to fetch it thence. But it not being found, inquiſition was made into all ſecret corners, the Wardrobes were ſearched, but nothing appear'd, to the great fear of thoſe to whoſe care it was committed, one accuſing the other to
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:39539:87"/>acquit himſelf. In fine, the matter was ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that ſome whiſpers there were concerning thoſe in whoſe hands the Cradle not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſeen to remain. The Women having guilty conſciences were amazed in being ſo cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed, and fearing the matter ſhould be per e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tly diſcovered, entred into conſultation what courſe they ſhould take to ſave their lives and their honour. In fine, they both concluded, that in ſuch an extremity deſperate remedies ought to be uſed, than which none was better than to ſet fire to the Seraglio,<note place="margin">The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> ſet on fire.</note> by which means, either the thing ſought for, would be eſteemed for burnt and conſumed by the fire, or in ſo great a loſs it might be hoped that matters of ſmaller moment would not be remembred. Wherefore the bold Wenches without other conſideration gave fire with their Candle to the roof of Cedar, of which wood moſt of the Womens rooms in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio are made, which in a moment made ſuch a flame, as with the help of a little wind, was carried through all the quarters of the Womens Apartments, and thence took its way to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van</hi> Chamber, and other conſiderable parts of the Court, where many Records and Regiſters of Law were conſumed to aſhes, together with one of the leſſer Treaſuries, where much richeſs, which endured not the teſt of fire, periſhed: And the whole Seraglio had run an evident hazard, had not the Boſtangees and other Servants of the Court ventured far into the flames, in which many of them miſerably periſhed. The fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quenched, and the Women afterwards (I know not how) detected to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors thereof, were ſent to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and being there accuſed, were ſtrangled by the immediate order of the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>But the deſtruction of that conſiderable part of the Seraglio was no impediment to the Grand Signiors return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being rebuilt with that ſpeed and induſtry, equal or excelling the magnificence of the former, that the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed for the Journey thither was not prolonged by reaſon thereof. Howſoever the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors averſion to the place made the wheels of his Chariots move ſlow, and the quickneſs of his Attendants grew ſlack and cold, obſerving ſo much diſpleaſure in their Emperor to the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. For though he was preſſed by the Vizier to begin his Journey, and could not handſomly refuſe to comply with the time appointed; yet to defer this reſolution as long as was poſſible; he contriv'd a long way of Meander towards <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his Journey in Company with the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier by way of the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> on pretence of viewing the Fortifications of the new Forts raiſed at the entrance of that Streight, and ſending ſome Proviſions from thence for Relief of <hi>Candia;</hi> wherefore the Captain-Paſha was commanded to Sea with three gallies, and at <hi>Gallipoli</hi> to attend the Grand Signiors arrival, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tranſport him thence to the Caſtles, and back again. And the deſign being now reſolved, and hot to proſecute the VVar in <hi>Candia;</hi> for tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſporting thither a numerous Army, it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the Captain-Paſha ſhould propoſe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſadour the Grand Signiors deſire of Fifteen Sail of Ships, with conſent of our King, for this Service, the <hi>Turks</hi> paying what reaſonable Rates ſhould be demanded. But the Earl of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelſea</hi> then Lord Ambaſſadour, modeſtly replied, That though His Majeſty of <hi>England</hi> did always entertain a good affection and a zealous diſpoſition towards the Affairs of the Grand Signior; yet at preſent the VVar with <hi>Holland,</hi> and ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with <hi>France,</hi> made his occaſions for his own Shipping more urgent than uſual, and the time moſt unſeaſonable to preſs his Majeſty in this particular: by which reply and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excuſes of the Ambaſſadour, the Captain-Paſha perceiving an averſneſs to the Propoſition, and that Chriſtians unwillingly arm <hi>Turks</hi> againſt the Croſs, gave an account of this diſcourſe to the Grand Signior and Vizier, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave order for the building of ſixty Gallies againſt the next Spring, which with what they had before would make up above an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Sail. The Rendezvous of this Fleet, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Saykes and other <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Veſſels,<note place="margin">The <hi>Turks</hi> prepare for a War on <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> from thence to tranſport the Vizier and his Army for <hi>Candia,</hi> was appointed to be made at <hi>Malvoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> of the ſucceſs of which we ſhall have occaſion (God willing) to diſcourſe in the following Year, which gave a beginning (as we may ſay) to the total loſs of that Country, and to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Siege, which in Hiſtory will bear the Fame of one of the moſt memorable in the World. And as a preparation thereunto, and as a ſupply of the preſent urgent neceſſities, three Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Engliſh,</hi> another <hi>French,</hi> and a third <hi>Dutch</hi> were laden with Corn, and thirty Sail of Beys Gallies, with all ſorts of Arms and Ammunition, with a Recruit of a thouſand Janiſaries, were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeeded from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for Reinforcement and Succour of that Iſland.</p>
                     <p>And now at length the Grand Signior after his long circuit arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he made his ſolemn Entry the Third of <hi>October,</hi> but not with that Joy and Pomp, which uſually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended other Sultans in their return from the Wars and labours to their Imperial City; but all things ſeemed like the Sultans humour, ſullen and diſpleaſed; for he ſeldom lodged in his Seraglio, or ſlept there, but at a ſmall Palace called <hi>Daout-Paſha,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The G. Signior arrives at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                        </note> where he for the moſt part made his abode; only ſometimes in the day he paſſed a few hours at his Seraglio, but reſted not there in the Night: The reaſons hereof ſome attributed to the remembrance of thoſe dangers and troubles which he had ſeen in that Court, and which made ſo deep an impreſſion on his fancy, that he could never enter within thoſe Gates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome ſenſe of terrour for the late diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>German</hi> War being thus concluded, the Sultan returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Affairs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing themſelves to ſpend their fury againſt <hi>Candia,</hi> all things growing black and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous towards that Coaſt, the <hi>Venetians</hi> prudently provided to oppoſe the ſtorm.

To this Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> a power was given to command in chief over all, without ſubjection to any other than to the Captain-General, and to the Proveditor General in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> when he waged War in that Province: And in ſhort, his actions were not to be queſtioned or examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other than the Senate it ſelf, to whom he was immediately ſubjected, and a Gally was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:39539:87"/>to be allotted purpoſely to tranſport him and his Family to <hi>Candia.</hi> Upon theſe conditions agreed at <hi>Turen,</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> took his Journey to <hi>Venice</hi> about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his Kinſman <hi>Franceſco Villa,</hi> his Nephew <hi>Benedetto</hi> Count of <hi>Lagnaſco,</hi> Count <hi>Lodovico Saluzza,</hi> and Count <hi>Bernardino Barret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> which Four ſerved in quality of Captains, together with <hi>Gio.

But I ſatisfie my ſelf in this, That as the mind which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives favours, and returns thanks is the ſame; ſo that mind which makes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments with a due ſenſe of them, doth in ſome meaſure equal the benefit, though it prove defective in expreſſions to declare it. I do therefore confeſs and acknowledge, that the Election you have been pleaſed to make of me amongſt ſo many conſpicuous Perſons, unto a Charge graced by moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Predeceſſours, and in it ſelf moſt honourable, is a moſt ſingular favour, and an effect of your immenſe Bounty to me; which though it be limited with ſome ſubordination, yet it may ſerve for the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Goal to a glorious Courſe of Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary labours. I muſt alſo farther acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That as it is the property of this moſt Serene Republick to receive momentary Services, and to render them Eternal by Records in Hiſtory; ſo they have been pleaſed to adjoyn unto my mean deſerts a remembrance of the humble devotion which my Anceſtors profeſſed towards them: I mean <hi>Alfonſo Villa</hi> my great Grand-father, who in that moſt glorious Fleet at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> whoſe Sails were the wings of Victory, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced his Chriſtian Zeal againſt that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which iſſuing from the bowels of Sea-monſters, continue to vent their ancient rage againſt your moſt Serene Highneſs.

                     <p>According to the preceding counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Marquiſs <hi>Villa,</hi> the Senate ſent by divers Convoys great plenty of Proviſion and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Candia,</hi> and fitted their Fleet with all things neceſſary; and ſtrengthened their Forts both with Horſe and Foot drawn out of their Gariſons on the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> being aſſiſted with Men and Money from other Princes and States. The Pope gave them liberty to levy Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:39539:88"/>men out of his Countries, the Emperour alſo furniſhed them with a conſiderable Force, to which were made Additions from other parts of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In this manner the prudent Care of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans provided for their own ſafety: But at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> things were more quiet, for it being Winter, the Turks made Entertainments for the German Ambaſſadour, who was firſt ſeaſted by the Chimacham, and twice afterwards, with much Magnificence, by the Great Vizier at his own Garden, ſeated on the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> all difficulties being before overcome, and agreed, unleſs the deliverance of the poor Captives from the Priſon and the Oar, who continued in the torment of expectation between hope and fear, either of liberty or perpetual ſlavery. Which Treaty though it properly belonged to the Vizier, to whom the abſolute power is derived, yet in formality it was reſerved for matter of the laſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience with the Grand Signior, who being deſirous to attend his Hunting and Paſtime abroad, was in pain, until he had complyed with his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice towards this Ambaſſadour, whoſe departure though not ſome time after deſigned, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often called upon to receive his Diſpatch from the Grand Signior, was admitted on the 31th of <hi>October</hi> to his Audience with the ſame formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and feaſting as is common to all other Ambaſſadours in the Divan, or place of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature, and received three and forty Coftans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on himſelf and his retinue, and thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conducted to the Chamber of Audience, with ſome of the principal Noblemen of his Company, they preſented themſelves on their Knees, with their Faces on the Ground, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Cuſtom of the Eaſtern Courts; with which occaſion the Heer <hi>Reningen,</hi> who had for ſixteen or ſeventeen years been Reſident for the Emperor,<note place="margin">The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors laſt Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the Grand Signior</note> a perſon grown infirm with Age and the Gout, and his Knees not ſo active and pliable as the younger ſort, coming alſo to take his turn in this proſtrate manner of Worſhip, was ſo rudely handled by the kapugibaſhees, who aſſiſted on each Arm at the Ceremony, that he not being able to bow his head ſo eaſily as others, was thruſt down by them with ſo little conſideration or reſpect, that his Brows and Forehead were broken on the Flour; which miſchance ſo diſordered him, as put him beſides that Speech which he had premediated in Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh to addreſs to the Grand Signior; and though he curbed what was poſſible his paſſion, whilſt he remained in the Royal Preſence, yet in vain after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he vented his Choler with words againſt thoſe unmannerly Officers without other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or ſatisfaction. The Demands of the Ambaſſadour were in writing read before the Grand Signior, according to the cuſtom of the Court, and principally concerned the freedom of the Slaves, ſome of which were then in the Gallies, and Banniard, and others of the moſt principal in the ſeven Towers. Other Demands there were in relation to the State of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> that for the future it might be free from Incurſions, in which particular the Turks had already vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated the Peace; and that a more orderly Government of Affairs might be obſerved on the Frontiers, than uſually had paſſed, as agreed by the laſt Capitulations. To which the Grand Signior gave no Anſwer, referring all to the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, only told the Ambaſſadour in ſhort, That he ſhould counſel his Maſter to beware of inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ottoman Dominions, or acting any thing in prejudice of the Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Articles of Peace made between the Two Emperors were for the moſt part a confirmation of the ancient Agreement, only it was provided as a new Addition.

                     <p>But whilſt theſe things were in agitation, and Ambaſſadours interchangeably at either Court, the <hi>Turks</hi> of <hi>Varadin</hi> and <hi>Janoua</hi> made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent incurſions into <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> deſtroying the Villages, and carrying away great numbers of Captives; and ſo lately, as about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, thoſe of <hi>Varadin</hi> conveyed themſelves privately under the Caſtle <hi>Cſeh,</hi> and robbed the Horſes belonging to that Gariſon, killed ſome, and carried others into ſlavery; at which time alſo Two thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> beſieged the Caſtle <hi>Valko,</hi> which they took, and razed to the ground; which Complaints of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Aggrievances the <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> intimated to the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadour, as matters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready acted contrary to the late Articles of Peace, requeſting farther to interpoſe for a modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abatement of their Tribute, which <hi>Kuperlee</hi> had, contrary to Oath and reaſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly augmented. But the Ambaſſadour ſeemed ſo coldly to interpoſe in this behalf, as taught the <hi>Turks</hi> to deny his Requeſts, acquieſcing with this Anſwer, That it was no breach of Peace then to make incurſions on the Frontiers, as alſo without Cannon to rob, and ſpoil, and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, not exceeding Five thouſand men in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

                        </note> which concerned moſt the Intereſt of the Empire, and not hazard it for ſuch like Concernments of <hi>Tranſilvania;</hi> for though it ſeemed ſtrange to the World to ſee a Peace haſtily clapt up with diſadvantageous Terms on the Emperors ſide, whilſt he was victorious and fortunate in ſeveral Enterprizes; yet they that penetrated farther into the State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire, report, That there was a neceſſity of making a moderate uſe of theſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes by a fair accommodation, rather than to tempt Providence by a too eager and continued proſecution of the War. For it was obſerved that the Deſigns of making the Duke of <hi>Anguien,</hi> Son to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward; and that there was a Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a dangerous League amongſt the Princes of the <hi>Rhine.</hi> The Diviſions between the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> encreaſed; the latter of which are known to be an obſtinate ſort of People.

                     <p>On the <hi>21th</hi> of the Month of <hi>November</hi> arrived ar <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> Monſieur <hi>De Ventelay,</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from the <hi>French</hi> King to the Grand Signior,<note place="margin">An Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour arrives from <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> who was Son to the Sieur <hi>De la Haye,</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ambaſſadour, a Perſon much talked of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he arrived; a generous and an accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman, and one well practiſed in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of that Countrey. To underſtand which ſtory the better we muſt look back to the former Year, at the beginning of which during the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> War, and that the Vizier remained in his Winter-quarters at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> a Courier with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to the Firſt Vizier arrived, who concealed not the occaſion of his coming, nor the contents of his Letters with that ſecrecy, but that thoſe who were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Tranſlation of the Papers into <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> made it publickly known to be no other than a recital of the many provocations his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty had received from the Pirates of <hi>Barbary,</hi> containing a Liſt of the Ships, Men, and Goods they had from time to time ſeized and made Prize: in vindication of which indignities to his Honour, and in protection of his People, he could not do leſs than make a War upon thoſe Pirates (for as yet the advice was not come, that the <hi>French</hi> had deſerted <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geri</hi>) in which for the foregoing reaſons the Grand Signior ought not to judge himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And for the Succour given the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, it was not afforded as King of <hi>France,</hi> but as one of the Princes of the Empire, in which capacity, by virtue of his Tenure, he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to contribute ſuch Forces on the like emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and diſtreſſes of the Empire. And if the foregoing reaſons were available with the Sultan to induce him (as in reaſon he ought) to believe he continued in perfect friendſhip with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breach of Articles, he was then ready to ſend his Ambaſſadour to reſide at the Port, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it might be Monſieur <hi>De Ventelay,</hi> Son to Monſieur <hi>De la Haye</hi> late Ambaſſadour there, who was the Perſon that had ſome time ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived indignities from the Vizier <hi>Kuperlee,</hi> that ſo his Majeſty might receive ſatisfaction, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the very Perſon of Monſieur <hi>De Ventelay,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by extraordinary demonſtrations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in reparation of the former affronts. This Meſſenger having tranſlated his Papers, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained licenſe to ride Poſt to the Vizier, and in the froſts and extremities of the weather in <hi>January</hi> ſet forward on his Journey; but in his paſſage through <hi>Adrianople,</hi> viſiting the Chimacam, and deſiring his licenſe in like manner to ride Poſt to the Vizier on publick affairs, received ſuch a leſſon of ſcorn and diſdain, vented with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of choler againſt the <hi>French</hi> Nation in publick Divan, with terms undecent to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated: And that in farther reſentment, if he were Firſt Vizier, he would refuſe to accept any friendſhip or alliance with them; but ſince he was inferiour to the Great Vizier, he would diſpeed him to the Camp, and grant him a Command for his Poſt. But it ſeems this Courier being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> was received with better terms, and more courteſie by the Vizier, who had learned by experience of the late Chriſtian Wars, and proof of the Valour of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, that the Propoſitions of that King were not lightly to be contemned. And therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that Monſieur <hi>De Ventelay</hi> might freely come (uſing their common expreſſion) that the Arms of the Port are always open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the addreſſes of Friends, Allies, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates.

Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the farther part of the City called the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Towers, the Ships came to an Anchor, from whence the Ambaſſadour ſent to adviſe the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier of his arrival, deſiring as one mark of the extraordinary honour promiſed him, that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn might be made to the Salute of his Ship from the Seraglio, by the Cannon which lay under the Wall, a Ceremony before never demanded, or practiſed with reſpect to any Chriſtian or Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Veſſel; and that his landing might be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with a more than uſual reception by the attendance of Officers, or at leaſt equalled to the Formalities of the late Engliſh Ambaſſadour. But the Vizier it ſeems judged, that the recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Engliſh, ſtrained on a particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was not to be brought into example, and that a Salute from the Seraglio was ſo beſides the ordinary cuſtom, that he eſteemed the demand to be extravagant, and that ſuch a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent would be diſhonourable to his Maſter. And therefore reſolving not to exceed the perticulars of former cuſtoms, offered at his landing to have him accompanied to his Houſe with ten Chaouſes, only the Ambaſſadour not accepting hereof, in a diſcontented manner entred with his Ship the day following, and giving the uſual Salutes to the Seraglio, landed at <hi>Topenau,</hi> a place near to his own Dwelling, from whence with no other attendance than his own Company, privately walked up, and with no farther ceremony took poſſeſſion of the place of Reſidence of former Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours from <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding this ſlight treatment, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour was not ſo much mortified, but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hopes, that the Turks would at length in contemplation of his Maſters greatneſs, gratifie him with ſome ſignal demonſtrations of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary honour, by conceſſions of unuſual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and greater facility in his Negotiations: and therefore was induced, though as yet he had not had a perſonal Audience of the Vizier, to deſire a revocation of the Agreement made with the Genoeſe, (the Marqueſs <hi>Durazzo,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken before, being juſt upon his departure) proteſting againſt it with all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, as a matter ſo prejudicial to the French Traffick and Commerce in thoſe Dominions, that if admiſſion were given to the Genoeſe, they muſt expect to loſe friendſhip and commerce with <hi>France.</hi> But notwithſtanding this heat and other proteſtations againſt it, the Vizier who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited his Fathers ſpirit, little regarded the diſcontent of the French, but calmly anſwered, That the Grand Signior was Maſter of himſelf and Country, and might make Peace or War at his own pleaſure without licence or permiſſion of the French king; and that ſuch as were envious, or diſcontented at the Peace, had free liberty to depart and take their remedy as they eſteemed moſt beneficial.</p>
                     <p>In this manner matters paſſed between the time of this Ambaſſadours Arrival and his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.<note place="margin">A ſtrange accident befallen the French Captain of the Man of War.</note> In which interim the curioſity of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Abermont,</hi> Captain of the French Man of War, had like to have proved fatal to him; for whilſt he viewed from the Gallery of his Ship the pleaſant ſituation of the Seraglio, and the Proſpect of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> behold at a diſtance appeared certain Gallies gently gliding down the ſtream, dreſſed up with Flags and Streamers, which all Ships and Saykes ſaluted with their Guns as they paſſed. This Captain being informed that the Grand Signior was there in perſon, and returned from his Hunting, which he had made in certain Woods not far from the City, ſaluted him alſo as he paſſed with twenty five Guns; but being not able to diſcover his perſon, preſently fitted his Boat and followed him, hoping to receive that ſatisfaction at his landing; fot conceiving, that acceſs to the Ottoman and Eaſtern Princes is as facile and grateful, as it is to thoſe of Chriſtendom, with all confidence endeavoured to accoſt the Perſon of the Grand Signior as near as was poſſible. The Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or turning his eyes, and ſeeing a man habited (as he conceived) in a barbarous and extravagant dreſs, apprehended the Majeſty of his Perſon vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by ſo near and bold an approach of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Stranger; and thereupon, without farther inquiry, being moved with ſcorn and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, called for the Executioner, who is ever rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at his hand; but ſome perſons then preſent, eſpecially the Boſtangibaſhee, being of more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, beſeeched the Grand Signior to have a little patience, and to enquire of the Ghaur or Infidel (as they call'd him) the cauſe of this his boldneſs: with which the Grand Signior ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a little his paſſion, and having patience until one was ſent to expoſtulate with the Captain, who all this while, though he perceived ſome diſturbance, was yet ignorant that the matter ſo dangerouſly concerned himſelf; and not being able to underſtand the Meſſenger, nor to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by him, rendred the buſineſs more confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and leſs underſtood: which the Meſſenger obſerving, and knowing the danger of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and innocent Gentleman, being perhaps of a compaſſionate nature, and prudent, framed this excuſe to the Grand Signior, That he did not well underſtand the Infidels language, but what he conjectured was, That he being Captain of that Veſſel, which had newly ſaluted his Majeſty as he paſſed with twenty five Guns, was now come in confidence of his Royal bounty and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency to receive a Coftan, as a ſign of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties favour, and reward of his own reſpect. The Grand Signior having by this time his choler ſomewhat abated, was better pacified with theſe gentle words; the Boſtangibaſhee alſo interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the ſame time in his behalf, that he was a ſtranger, and ignorant of the cuſtoms of their Court, and that if he deſerved puniſhment, he might be remitted to the examination of the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who might chaſtiſe him, as he found it reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. The Grand Signior contented herewith, the rude Boſtangees ſeized the Captain and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to the Viſier, who all this time was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his errour or his danger, more than that he perceived by accent of their words, and by their geſtures, that ſomething was amiſs, and debated in reference unto him. The Drugger-men, or Interpreters of the French Nation being ſent for, and the Viſier and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain both underſtanding the matter, the crime appeared only to be an abſurdity committed through ignorance: yet to pleaſe the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, and to make an appearance, as if ſomething were done in chaſtiſement of this bold curioſity, the Viſier ordered, that the Captain ſhould be conducted by two Chaouſes to the Ambaſſadour, there to be put in Chains and in Priſon, until ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction was made for his fault. The Captain being thus brought before the Ambaſſadour, this honeſt Gentleman was puniſhed in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as we do thoſe in Chriſtendom, who crowd to ſee their Prince.</p>
                     <p>The Ambaſſadour had his firſt Audience with the Vizier on the 7th of <hi>December,</hi> which being inſignificant to any other buſineſs more than to the delivery of his Maſters Letters, and other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:39539:89"/>of Form and Ceremony, we ſhall need to inſiſt the leſs upon it.</p>
                     <p>His ſecond Audience before that of the Grand Signior,<note place="margin">The French Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours ſecond Audience.</note> was in the beginning of <hi>January,</hi> at which time the Ambaſſadour began to declare what he had in Commiſſion from his King, which principally related towards a ſatisfaction for thoſe Affronts formerly offered him in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Father, and himſelf inculcating into the Viſier a true apprehenſion of the greatneſs of his Maſter, his force by Land, his powerful Fleet which ſhould that following year be ſet ſorth in the Mediterranean Seas, with other arguments which might challenge due reſpect and honour to ſo great a Prince. Theſe Propoſals and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, though the Vizer ſeemed not to entertain with that benign and flexible ear as was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or thought ſatisfactory, and thereupon ſeveral diſguſts did afterwards ſucceed; howſoever in the end all matters cleared up again, and his Excellency was permitted to return to his own Houſe with all imaginatble ſatisfaction, as he was pleaſed to intimate to the Ambaſſadour for his Majeſty of great <hi>Britain.</hi> Soon after followed his Audience with the Grand Signior according to the uſual Ceremonies, ſo that all things run ſmoothly with the French for ſeveral years after. And here by the way it is obſervable, That an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Ambaſſadour once arguing hotly with the Vizier on ſome points of the Capitulations, in which judging himſelf wronged, threw the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations to the Vizier, telling him, that he might keep the Writing and Paper, ſince he reſolved not to obey the Letter. The Vizier hereupon calmly took the Capitulations, and laid them behind his Cuſhion, which the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in a more conſiderate temper could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recover under an expence of fifteen hundred Pieces of Eight.</p>
                     <p>During the time of theſe Negotiations the Grand Signior wholly imployed his time and thoughts in Hunting, ranging all the Woods for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days journies round <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in which Exerciſe twenty or thirty thouſand men were imployed, collected from the Cities and Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges round about, all which were paid at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick expence and charge of Houſe-keepers both Turks and Chrſtians;<note place="margin">The Grand Signiors Huntings.</note> which in one hunt might amount to thirty or forty thouſand Dollars. With this burden the people being often opppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and many periſhing in the Woods with cold and hunger, began to murmur at the exceſs of Tyranny, curſing their Princes madneſs and folly, maintained with the life and ruine of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. But notwithſtanding all theſe whiſpered curſes and ſecret menaces the Grand Signior fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his delights with ſuch frequency, and with that heat and eagerneſs, that the people percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no end of their miſery, began to ſpeak loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly, and by ſome principal Perſons gave the Viſier to underſtand, That the people would not longer endure the extravagant Vagaries of their Prince at ſo dear a rate, of which he thar was his chief Councellour ought to inform and adviſe him. The Vizier, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſenſible of the exceſs of his Maſters humour in this particular, and that immoderation, even in lawful and innocent exerciſes, may become a Vice, and when acted with oppreſſion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as dangerous as other terms which ſound more of Tyranny and Violence, reſolved with courage and humility to repreſent to his Maſter the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch expenſive Huntings, eſpecially when over frequent; and therefore aſſured thoſe who made their Complaints, That for the future all matters ſhould be redreſſed, and the Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſhould not be ſo prodigal in his Huntings on the Purſe of his Subjects. And ſo ſenſible was the Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the diſorders which might ariſe from hence, if ſome remedy were not ſpeedily applied, that he immediately departed <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to find out the Grand Signior, who was lodged in ſome retired cool place, environed with Woods and Mountains; leaving <hi>Solyman</hi> Paſha for Chimacham, or Deputy, in his place, in whoſe former Government many terrible Fires had happened in <hi>Conſtantinaple.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>About this time Advice came to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> of certain Addreſſes the <hi>Nogay</hi> Tartar had made to the Paſha of <hi>Siliſtria</hi> to obtain a Country to live in between the Rivers of <hi>Boriſtheneſe</hi> and the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube;</hi> for that their own Country being full,<note place="margin">The <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay</hi> Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Lands of the Grand Signior.</note> they were forced to abandon and empty it of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of fifty thouſand Families, who lived in Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, and had about a hundred thouſand head of Cattel, all which with their ſubſtance, they prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Subjects to the Grand Signior, if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to afford them protection, and Land for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and habitation. The Paſha approving here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, gave them aſſurance of ſecurity under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his Maſters favours, ſending information thereof to the Port, who willingly embraced theſe new-come Gueſts, and entered into conſultation what Country and limits ſhould be aſſigned them. In the mean time the <hi>Krim</hi> Tartar jealous of this people, and not knowing what inconvenience ſuch Neighbourhood might produce, fell upon them, and cut off a great number of them, forcing the reſt to reurn into their own Country, which though ill taken at firſt by the Turks, was yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards excuſed by the Tartar, and diſſembled by the Port.</p>
                     <p>Though all things appeared quiet at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> after the Peace concluded with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and that the German Ambaſſadour was returned back to his Maſter; yet the Turks proſecuted their deſigns againſt <hi>Venice,</hi> aad made great preparations in the Provinces of <hi>Albania, Boſſena,</hi> and <hi>Licca,</hi> which confine on the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Territories; and though in reality thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not intended againſt thoſe parts, but in order to a more warm proſecution of the War in <hi>Candia,</hi> whether the Vizier intended to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf in Perſon; yet the Venetian State not fully penetrating the Deſign, took the Alarm chiefly in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and reinforced their Garriſons of <hi>Cataro</hi> and other Fortreſſes. And that matters there might be well provided, and all things acted with due circumſpection; Marquiſs <hi>Villa</hi> was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to viſit thoſe Garriſons in his Voyage to <hi>Candia;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys the Forts in <hi>Dalmatia.</hi>
                        </note> ſo that departing from <hi>Venice</hi> attended with two Gallies, he arrived in a few days at <hi>Zara,</hi> and thence proceeding to <hi>Spalato,</hi> where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veditor General, <hi>Catarin Cornaro,</hi> made at that time his reſidence; they both joined together to ſurvey the moſt important places of that Province. They began with the City of <hi>Spalato,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spalato.</note> which rather ſeems a place intended by Nature for a Palace of delights, than a Garriſon of Arms; being the Seat which <hi>Diocleſian</hi> (who was born at <hi>Salona,</hi> ſix miles diſtance from thence) choſe for his Garden of retirement, after he had renounced the Empire, and is now turned into a ruder ſhape of War, ſince the invaſion of the Turk made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be fortified for ſecurity of it ſelf, and the parts circumjacent. <hi>Spalato</hi> is now very ſtrong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecured by divers Redoubts; the chief of which is ſcituated on a little riſing, called <hi>Grippe,</hi> diſtant about a Musket-ſhot from the Town, is ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with four Royal Baſtions, and with good Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, there is alſo a new Line of Fortification drawn round the Town, which renders it the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt conſiderable of all <hi>Dalmatia:</hi>
                        <pb n="172" facs="tcp:39539:90"/>But to make this place the more impregnable, theſe Generals laid the foundation for another Bulwark; and as an evidence of their Union, they caſt a Medal with a ſtamp on one ſide of <hi>Cornaro,</hi> and on the other of Marquis <hi>Villa,</hi> and ſo rendring thanks to God, the Service ended with firing all the Guns of the Town.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards both the Generals Embarking, paſſed that Night to <hi>Curzola,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Curzola.</note> anciently called <hi>Corſina Negra,</hi> which is one of the greateſt and beſt of the Iſles of this Gulf; Thence paſſing by <hi>Raguſi,</hi> where the Deputies of that Government, in recognition of that Soveraignty which the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> have over the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Seas, preſented the uſual refreſhments to the General of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and in a particular manner treated Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>Villa</hi> with a Preſent in name of their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. That Night they arrived at the Entrance of the Channel of <hi>Cataro,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cataro &amp; Peraſto.</note> and taking <hi>Peraſto</hi> in their way (which is a ſtrong Fortification about ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Cataro</hi>) they were received there with firing all the Guns of the Town, which were doubly multiplied by an Eccho returned from the ſound of the neighbouring Mountains. Thence they proceeded to viſit <hi>Budua,</hi> a place well fortified, as alſo Fort St. <hi>George</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Lieſina,</hi> which is the uſual Rendezvous of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines,</hi> and armed Barques; at length they went to <hi>Almiſſa,</hi> where they made a general Muſter of all the Forces of the Province; in all which places having viewed and amended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Fortification, and given order for ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with Ammunition and Proviſions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; they returned back to ſee the famous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of <hi>Cliſſa,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cliſſa.</note> the Situation of which ſeems to have been planted when Nature deſired to ſport, and be wanton; for it iſſues, as it were, out of the Boſom of two Mountains, which are at an equal diſtance from the Town, and then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at each end into the faſhion of a Bow, ſeem to form a Triumphal Arch. The paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through theſe Mountains is ſo narrow and crooked, that it appears like a Labyrinth; and being ſupplied with plenty of Fountains and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns both within and without the Fortreſs, the Suburbs demol ſhed, and no incumbrances to cloy and weaken its ſtrength, is certainly more obliged to Nature for its defence than to Art. From hence they proceeded to view <hi>Sebenico,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sebenico.</note> which is another ſtrong Fortreſs, ſituated on a riſing Hill, and overviews a ſpacious Port, the entrance to which is ſecured by the Fort St. <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las;</hi> and the City it ſelf, beſides its own Walls, is guarded by a Cittadel, and by the new works of St. <hi>John,</hi> ſituated on two Hills: From hence the Generals returning to <hi>Zara,</hi> the Capital City of the Province which being encompaſſed by the Sea, annexed to the Land only by a Bridg, which is alſo defended by a Fort, is rendered the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt impregnable of all the Fortreſſes. And here having made a general Muſter of all the Forces, and viſited the Country of <hi>Novigrade,</hi> and <hi>Poſſidaria,</hi> the habitations of the <hi>Morlach</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, the Marquis returned again to <hi>Venice,</hi> being called thither by the Senate; for the Year being now well ſpent, and the Winter approaching too near to admit of any conſiderable action; the time grew ſeaſonable for Counſels, in which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Affairs of Wars might beſt and moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly be directed for the ſucceeding year. Yet in regard Advices were come from <hi>Candia,</hi> That the <hi>Turks</hi> were much afflicted with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence, and ſcarcity of all Proviſions; it was judged requiſite to proſecute the War the more eagerly againſt them, before the Great Vizier arrived there with ſuch an Army as commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends his Perſon; it being adviſed from Count <hi>Leſlie,</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that the whole force of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Armes was to refund it ſelf ſpeedily on that Iſland. This In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence haſtned the departure of Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> from <hi>Venice,</hi> with ſuch Force as was then in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, being directed with neceſſary Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of what he ought to act in <hi>Candia.</hi> In his Voyage thither he touched at <hi>Corfu, Cefalonia,</hi> and <hi>Zant,</hi> and afterwards happily arrived on the ſixth of <hi>December</hi> at the Iſle of <hi>Paros</hi> or <hi>Pareſi</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> where he met with the Captain-General, and other Chief Commanders of the Fleet, together with <hi>Vuertmiller</hi> the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance; and here the Marquis reforming ſeveral Companies, which were much diminiſhed in their numbers, a general Muſter was made of all the Forces, which being ranged in form of Battel, they were accounted to amount unto eighteen hundred Horſe, and eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred ninety five Foot. This Army had ſome want of Fire-Arms, and other Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, of which the Senate being adviſed, they promiſed to ſupply all by a Convoy, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring; and congratulating in their Letters to Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> the good News of his happy Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at <hi>Paros,</hi> raiſed and prompted him to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements worthy his Courage and Grandeur; for being a Perſon now elevated on the Bulwarks of <hi>Candia,</hi> he ſeemed to ſtand on that Theater, where he had all <hi>Europe</hi> for his Spectators.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE Currant of our Negotiations ran ſmoothly this year without any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interruption in all parts of <hi>Turky,</hi> unleſs at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> where the Emim, or Cuſtomer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his uſual practice, began a new pretence, not only againſt former Preſidents, but alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Letter of Capitulations, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding 2 ½ <hi>per Cent.</hi> Cuſtom at <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> and 3 at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> a matter againſt which our Articles of Peace and Commerce have made many and ſundry Proviſions: Notwithſtanding the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (like others of his Predeceſſors, who have ever at <hi>Aleppo</hi> made Diſputes about their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, without being reſtrained by the moſt ſtrict Imperial Commands, and plaineſt Deciſions of the Law) reſolved to make good his pretence by a ſequeſtration on the whole Cargo of two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ships then under his Cuſtody in the Cuſtom-houſe. The Conſul hereupon had recourſe to the Juſtice of the Kadi, and there produced the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations, the Hatteſheriff, or Royal Signature, under the hand of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> wherein the particulars of Cuſtom were regulated, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the preſent Vizier, and his Father, and other Commands from <hi>Adrianople</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> all of the ſame tenour. The Emim on the other ſide, had no other Argument than his Baratz or Patent from the Tefterdar or Lord Treaſurer, which was ſo prevalent, and of that force with the Kadi, joined with the fear and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour he bore towards the Emim; that it was judged by him to ſtand in ballance with all the other Imperial Signatures; and therefore left the buſineſs (which was as much as the Cuſtomer deſired) undecided, making a Declaration, that the reaſons on both ſides were ſo forcible, and the arguments ſo equal, that he concluded it more proper, that a matter of ſo great importance ſhould be reſerved for the determination of more
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:39539:90"/>powerful and eminent Officers. The matter ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thus doubtfully, the Emim conceiving it too great a pawn to detain ſo great a quantity of Cloth for a difference only in the Cuſtom, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every man his conſignation, reſerving only fifty Bales to make himſelf good on the judgment and commands he expected ſhortly in his favour. The difference being now referred up to the Court, the Lord Ambaſſador received the juſt complaints of the Conſul and Merchants; for redreſs of which abuſes, his Excellency diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf, then his Secretary and Druggerman, to the Vizier at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> attending the advice of the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſadors entrance into the Frontiers. The Vizier having heard the difference, was ready to have paſſed ſentence in our favour, had not the Tefterdar, the only Advocate for the Cuſtomer, from whom the Original of our Evils was derived, put an unhappy obſtacle in the courſe of our Negotiations, pretending that there were ancient Tefters or accompts amongſt his Books, which mentioned two and a half <hi>per Cent.</hi> at <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> and three at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> and though it was urged to the contrary, that we never had to do with the Regiſters of the Treaſurers, nor had managed any Apalto, or Farm of the Grand Signior; but our Capitulations are our Law and Rule, and our Commands Regiſtred in the Reis Efendi's, or Secretaries Office, than which we never had, nor could ever acknowledg any other Canon: yet the Vizier over-ruled our reaſons, and we were forced to ſubmit, until the Tefter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar took his leiſure to examine and conſult his Books.</p>
                        <p>The Vizier and his Army being then upon their return, we found no opportunity to renew our ſollicitations, until we came to <hi>Niſſa,</hi> where the Army had two days of repoſe, and there again as in other places before, we urged the Tefterdar ſo importunately, that at length we compelled him to acknowledg to the Vizier, that our affairs were not Regiſtred in his Office. So that now we took liberty to declare our Reaſons to the Vizier; which we drew from our Capitulations, the ancient Hatteſheriff of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the Vizier and his Father's own Commands, and Copies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the like tenour, not omitting other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Evidences, which rendered the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not a little clear and apparent to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Vizier: who thereupon reprehended the Tefterdar, for ſeeking by his Command to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an innovation contrary to our Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and promiſed us Commands in our favour; but we replied, that we had already Commands, and the Grand Signiors own Royal Signature on our ſide, and that our Ambaſſador had not ſent us ſo many days Journey to ſeek another, which perhaps would as ill be obſerved as the former; But it was the puniſhment of the Cuſtomer which the Ambaſſador expected, who againſt ſo many clear Evidences, durſt proceed to the violation of them all Many other words were added perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and forcible to the preſent purpoſe. To which the Vizier anſwered, that he was now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Journey, where buſineſs of this nature was ill diſpatched. And therefore ordered us to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he ſhould have more leiſure to conſider what was fit to be done in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to juſtice and ſatisfaction of the Ambaſſador. Hereupon I left the Army, wherein I was much incommoded, and proceeded with all haſte to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Great Vizier in ſome days after me arrived, and there we renewed our wonted endeavours, and ſollicitations, that we might come to an end of this buſineſs, and that juſtice might be done us: But the Vizier willing to gratifie the Tefterdar, was not forward to paſs his Sentence, but put us again off to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> where the Books ſhould be peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that were laid up amongſt the Regiſters of the <hi>Divan:</hi> For that this matter was a concernment of the Grand Signiors, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of which, he ought to be tender and conſiderate. That for ſending for <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Aga, the Cuſtomer (which was one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of our demands) to anſwer for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had done our Nation, he was already ordered to appear at Court, where he ſhould be ready to ſtand to judgment for what the Ambaſſador ſhould object againſt him: and this had been the anſwer which was contrived to be given to the Ambaſſador himſelf, in caſe he had (as once he deſigned) appeared at <hi>Adrianople</hi> in perſon on this occaſion.</p>
                        <p>The Vizier arriving at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſome few Months after; the Lord Ambaſſador ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Audience of him on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> preſſing ſtill for juſtice againſt the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of <hi>Aleppo:</hi> but nothing thereof could be procured, beſides a Command for reſtitution of the fifty Bales of Cloth, detained in the hands of the Emim, upon the pretence before related, and that the payment of Cuſtoms ſhould be regulated after the rate of three <hi>per Cent.</hi> according to the ancient uſance. For putting this Command in execution, an Aga was ordered to be diſpatched, for whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice herein the Vizier allotted a thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhould be paid him, which though an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant reward, yet to put an honour and authority on the buſineſs, and not to diſpleaſe the Vizier, it was granted to him, and ſo he was diſpatched the <hi>25th.</hi> for <hi>Aleppo.</hi> But the troubles of our Merchants at <hi>Aleppo</hi> ended not here: For the Tefterdar greatly enraged to ſee his deſigns againſt us to have no better iſſue, thought to trouble us by a new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prohibiting the Scale of <hi>Scanderoon</hi> to all <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other Chriſtian Veſſels, and that the Factories ſhould be transferred again over to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Soria;</hi> a place formerly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by our Merchants, but by reaſon of the danger and inconvenience of that Port, the Trade was tranſported to the Scale of <hi>Scanderoon.</hi> This alteration the Tefterdar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been granted to the Merchants at their earneſt Petition, and promiſe to the Grand Signior, of payment of 13000 Dollars Yearly, for diſcharge and maintenance of thoſe Guards which were requiſite in that place for ſafety of the Coaſt, and defence of the Caravans which paſs with Merchants goods to <hi>Aleppo;</hi> but time and corruption of the Miniſters had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Grand Signior of the benefit of that duty. And this he urged with the greater inſtance and eagerneſs, knowing that the Scale of <hi>Scanderoon</hi> being prohibited, the Hatteſheriff whereon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the priviledg of the Merchants, and their ſole ſecurity muſt conſequently fall, and they forced to a new agreement. On this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lord Ambaſſador had Audience with the Vizier, and inſiſted on that point of our Capitulations, which gives us liberty to Trade in any part of the Grand Signiors Dominions; and therefore to conſent to be reſtrained, or confined to any particular place, was to aſſent to a breach of the Capitulations, which was out of his power, and only to be diſpenſed with by his Maſter the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the Grand Signior, by whom they were eſtabliſhed; and to connive or aſſent to the breach of one particular clauſe, was to hazard the loſs and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:39539:91"/>breach of the whole: for that our Capitulations (to uſe the <hi>Turks</hi> ſaying) are like a ſtring of Berds, of which, when one link is broken, the others drop off. To which the Vizier replied, that the Scale of <hi>Scandroon</hi> was open, and clear as before for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Teſterdar, and Cuſtomer, pretended that the Grand Signior was put to great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for maintenance of a Watch and Guard at that Port, which was only in reſpect to the ſecurity of the Merchants Goods; Orders ſhould be given for taking away thoſe Officers, as unneceſſary and inſignificant to the publick Service; no Guards having ever been in that place, the Embaſſador judged his buſineſs to be granted, and ſo thanked the Vizier and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But not many days after the Teſterdar procured a Command for ſhutting the Scale of <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> and tranſporting the Factory to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Howſoever it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the tranſaction of all this buſineſs, that it is diccicult to bring a corrupt <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Miniſter to Juſtice or puniſhment, meerly for breach of our Capitulations, or in reſpect to any difference or abuſe offered to Chriſtians, unleſs the complaint be accompanied with Preſents or Money, which are moſt prevalent Arguments in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court; and in this caſe I really believe, that had three or four thouſand Dollars been offered as a reward for bringing the Cuſtomer to capital pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, the complaint had found acceptance, and honourable ſucceſs: for default of which, the Cauſe was ſtarved, and naked, and carried no fire or heat in thoſe aggravations with which it was repreſented. It is likewiſe obſervable, that buſineſs in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court doth not always find that diſpatch, or expedition, as is generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> unleſs it come accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the intereſt of the Miniſters themſelves, and then it is tranſacted in a moment, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe languiſhed with delays, and will never want excuſes to deſer it.</p>

                     <p>WE ſhall begin this Year with the ſtrange rumour and diſturbance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> their pretended Meſſiah, which for being moſt principally acted in <hi>Turkey,</hi> may properly belong to the Hiſtory of this time and place; which therefore for delight of the Readers, I ſhall here inſert: for though it may have been elſewhere publiſhed, yet being an iſſue of my Pen, I may lawfully now own it, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex it to this Hiſtory, in reſpect of that near co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence it may have therewith; and that many other particulars have been added thereunto, which ſucceeded until the Death of this <hi>Sabatai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>According to the Predictions of ſeveral Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Writers, eſpecially of ſuch who comment upon the <hi>Apocalypie</hi> or <hi>Revelations,</hi> this year of 1666. was to prove a year of Wonders, of ſtrange Revolutions in the World, and particularly, of bleſſing to the <hi>Jews,</hi> either in reſpect of their Converſion to the Chriſtian Faith. or of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration to their Temporal Kingdom. This opinion was ſo dilated and fixt in the Countries of the Reformed Religion, and in the heads of Fanatical Enthuſiaſts, who dreamed of Fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, the down fall of the hope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, and the greatneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> inſomuch, that this ſubtil people judged this Year the time to ſtir, and to fit their Motion according to the ſeaſon of the Modern Prophecies. Whereupon ſtrange reports flew from place to place, of the March of multitudes of People from unknown parts into the remote deſerts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> ſuppoſed to be the Ten Tribes and a half, loſt for ſo many Ages. That a Ship was arrived in the Northern parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with her Sails and Cordage of Silk, navigated by Marriners who ſpoke nothing but <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and with this Motto on their Sails, <hi>The Twelve Tribes of Iſrael.</hi> Theſe reports agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus near to former Predictions, put the wild ſort of the World into an expectation of ſtrange accidents this Year ſhould produce in reference to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Monarchy.</p>
                     <p>In this manner Millions of people were poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> firſt appeared at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and publiſhed himſelf to the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, relating the greatneſs of their approaching Kingdom, the ſtrong hand whereby God was about to deliver them from Bondage, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them from all the parts of the World. It was ſtrange to ſee how this fancy took, and how faſt the report of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and his Doctrine flew through all parts where <hi>Jews</hi> inhabited, and ſo deeply poſſeſſed them with a belief of their new Kingdom and Riches; and many of them with promotion to Offices of Government, renown and greatneſs; that in all places from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to <hi>Buda</hi> (which it was my fortune that Year to travel) I perceived a ſtrange tranſport in the <hi>Jews,</hi> none of them attending to any buſineſs, unleſs to wind up former Negotiations, and to prepare themſelves and Families for a Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> all their Diſcourſes, their Dreams, and diſpoſal of their affairs, tended to no other deſign but a re-eſtabliſhment in the Land of Promiſe, to Greatneſs and Glory, Wiſdom and Doctrine of the Meſſiah, whoſe Original, Birth and Education is firſt to be recounted.</p>

                        <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was Son of <hi>Mordecai Sevi,</hi> an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant and Natural of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> who gained his Livelihood by being Broker to an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in that place; a perſon who before his Death was very decrepit in his Body, and full of the Gout and other infirmities: But his Son <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> addicting himſelf to ſtudy and learning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a notable Proficient in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi> Languages; and eſpecially in Divinity and Metaphyſicks, he was ſo cunning a Sophiſter, that he vented a new Doctrine in their Law, and drew to the profeſſion of it ſo many Diſciples, as raiſed one day a tumult in the Synagogue; for which afterwards he was by cenſure of the Kock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams (who are the Expounders of the Law) ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the City.</p>
                     <p>During the time of his Exile he travelled to <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> now called <hi>Salonica,</hi> where he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a very handſom Woman; but either not having that part of Oeconomy as to govern a Wife, or being impotent as to Women, as was pretended, or that ſhe ſound not favour in his eyes, ſhe was divorced from him. Again, he took a ſecond Wife more beautiful than the former; but the ſame cauſes of diſcontent raiſing a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between them, he obtained another Divorce from this Wife alſo. And being now free from the incumbrances of a Family, his wandring head
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:39539:91"/>moved him to travel through the <hi>Morea,</hi> thence to <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Syria, Gaza</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by the way picked up a <hi>Ligorneſe</hi> Lady, whom he made his third Wife, the Daughter of ſome <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> her Original and Country not being very well known. And being now at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> he began to reform their Law, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the Faſt of <hi>Tamuz,</hi> (which they keep in the month of <hi>June</hi>) and meeting there with a certain <hi>Jew</hi> called <hi>Nathan,</hi> a proper Inſtrument to promote his deſign, he communicated to him his condition, his courſe of life, and intentions to declare himſelf the Meſſiah of the World, ſo long expected and deſired by the <hi>Jews.</hi> This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign took wonderfully with <hi>Nathan;</hi> and becauſe it was thought neceſſary, according to Scripture and ancient Prophecies, that <hi>Elias</hi> was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Meſſiah, as St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was the Fore-runner of Chriſt, <hi>Nathan</hi> thought no man ſo proper to act the part of the Prophet as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and ſo no ſooner had <hi>Sabatai</hi> declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Meſſiah, but <hi>Nathan</hi> diſcovers himſelf to be his Prophet, forbidding all the Faſts of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and declaring that the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom being come, nothing but joy and triumph ought to dwell in their habitations; writing to all the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Jews</hi> to perſwade them to the ſame belief. And now the Schiſm being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and many <hi>Jews</hi> really believing what they ſo much deſired, <hi>Nathan</hi> took the courage and boldneſs to propheſie, That one year from the <hi>27th</hi> of<note n="*" place="margin">June.</note> 
                        <hi>Kiſlau,</hi> which is the Month of <hi>July,</hi> the Meſſiah was to appear before the Grand Signior, and to take from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Which novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſo affected the <hi>Jews,</hi> Inhabitants of thoſe parts, that they gave up themſelves wholly to their Prayers, Alms, and Devotions; and to confirm this belief the more, it happened that at the ſame time that news hereof with all particulars were diſpatched from <hi>Gaza,</hi> to acquaint the Brethren in foreign parts; the rumour of the Meſſiah had flown ſo ſwift, and gained ſuch reception, that Intelligence came from all Countries, where the <hi>Jews</hi> ſojourn, by Letters to <hi>Gaza</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> congratulating the happineſs of their deliverance, and expiration of their time of ſervitude by the appearance of the Meſſiah. To which they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned other Prophecies relating to that Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Meſſiah was to have over all the World, that for nine Months after he was to diſappear; during which time the <hi>Jews</hi> were to ſuffer, and ſeveral of them to undergo Martyrdom; but then returning again mounted on a Coeleſtial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with his Bridle made of Serpents with ſeven heads, accompanied with his Brethren the <hi>Jews,</hi> who inhabited on the other ſide of the River <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> he ſhould be acknowledged for the ſole Monarch of the Univerſe, and then the Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould deſcend from Heaven already built, framed, and beautified, wherein they ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Sacrifices for ever. And here I leave the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to conſider, how ſtrangely this deceived Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was amuſed, when theſe confident and vain reports and dreams of Power and Kingdoms had wholly tranſported them from the ordinary courſe of their trade and intereſt.</p>
                     <p>This noiſe and rumour of the Meſſiah having begun to fill all places, <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> reſolved to travel towards <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Country of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and thence to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the capital City, where the principal work of preaching was to be performed: <hi>Nathan</hi> thought it not fit to be long after him, and therefore travels by way of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> where reſolving to continue ſome time for better propagation of this new Doctrine, in the mean while writes this Letter to <hi>Sabatai Sevi,</hi> as followeth.</p>

                     <p>And now all the Cities of <hi>Turkie,</hi> where the Jews inhabited, were full of the expectation of the Meſſiah, no Trade or courſe of gain was followed; every one imagined, that daily Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, Riches, Honours, and Government were to deſcend upon him by ſome unknown and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous manner. An Example of which is moſt obſervable in the Jews at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> who now full of aſſurance, that the reſtauration of their Kingdom, and the accompliſhment of the times for the Coming of the Meſſiah was at hand, judged themſelves obliged to double their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and purifie their Conſciences from all ſins and enormities; which might be obſerved by the ſcrutiny of him who was now come to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the very thoughts and imaginations of Mankind. For which work, certain Kochams were appointed to direct the people in the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Prayers, Devotions, and Faſtings: but ſo forward was every one now in his acts of Penance, that they ſtayed not for the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Kocham, or Preſcriptions or Rules, but applied themſelves immediately to Faſtings, and ſome in that manner beyond the abilities of Nature, that having for the ſpace of ſeven days taken no ſuſtenance, were famiſhed: others buried themſelves in their Gardens, covering their naked bodies with earth, their heads only excepted, remained in thoſe beds of dirt, until their bodies were ſtiffned with the cold and moiſture: others would endure to have melted wax dropt upon their ſhoulders: others to roul themſelvs in ſnow, and throw their bodies in the coldeſt ſeaſon of the winter into the Sea, or frozen waters. But the moſt common man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mortification was firſt to prick their backs and ſides with thorns, and then to give themſelves thirty nine laſhes. All buſineſs was laid aſide, none worked or opened ſhop, unleſs to clear his Ware-hoſe of Merchandiſe at any price: who had ſuperfluity in Houſhold-ſtuff ſold it for what he could, but yet not to Jews, who were interdicted from all bargains or ſales un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Excommunication, pecuniary mulcts, or corporal puniſhment; for their comportment as to buſineſs and imployment was eſteemed the teſt or touch-ſtore of their ſaith. It being the general Tenent, That in the days that the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah appeared, the Jews ſhould become Maſters of the Eſtates and Inheritance of Infidels; until when, they ought to content themſelves with matters only neceſſary to maintain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port life. But becauſe that every one was not Maſter of that Proviſion and Fortune as to live without daily labour; therefore to quiet the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the poor, and prevent the enormous lives of ſome, who upon theſe occaſions would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vagabonds, and deſert their Cities, due order was taken to make collections, which were ſo liberally beſtowed, that in <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> only four hundred poor were ſupported by the meer charity of the richer. And as they endeavoured to purge their conſciences of ſin, and to apply themſelves to good works, that the Meſſiah might find the City prepared for his reception; ſo leſt he ſhould accuſe them of any omſſion in their Law, and particularly in their neglect of that ancient Prcept of Increase and multiply, they married children together of ten years of age, and ſome under, without reſpect to richeſs or poverty, condition or quality; but being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly joyned to the number of ſix or ſeven hundred couple, upon better and cooler thoughts, after the deceit of the falſe Meſſiah was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, or the expectation of his Coming grew cold, were divorced, or by conſent ſeparated from each other.</p>
                     <p>In the heat of all this talk and rumour came <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the City of his Nativiry, infinitely deſired there by the common Jews, but by the Kochams or Doctors of their Law, who gave little or no credence to what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was ill received, not knowing what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief or ruine this Doctrine and Prophecy of a new Kingdom might produce. Yet <hi>Sabatai</hi> bringing with him Teſtimonials of his Sanctity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Life, Wiſdom, and gift of Prophecy ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed himſelf in the heart of the generality, both as being holy and wiſe, that thereupon he took courage and boldneſs to enter into diſpute with the Grand Kocham (who is the head or chief Expoſitor of their Law, and Superintendent of their civil Government) between whom the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments grew ſo high, and language ſo hot, that the Jews who favoured the Doctrine of <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai,</hi> and feared the Authority of the Kocham, doubtful what might be the iſſue of the conteſt, appeared in great numbers before the Kaddee of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> in juſtification of their new Prophet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo much as any accuſation came againſt him; the Kaddee according to the cuſtom of the Turks ſwallowed money on both ſides, and afterwards remitted them to the determination of their own Juſtice: In this manner <hi>Sabatai</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ground daily; and the Grand Kocham with his Party, loſing both the affection and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his People, was diſplaced from his Office, and another conſtituted more affectionate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the new Prophet, whoſe Power daily increaſed by thoſe confident reports of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being ſtruck with phrenſie and madneſs, until being reſtored to their former temper and wits by him, became his Friends, Admirers, and Diſciples. No invitation was now made in <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> by the Jews, nor Marriage, or Circumciſion held, where <hi>Sabatai</hi> was not preſent, accompanied to the ſolemnities with multitudes of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the ſtreets covered with Carpets or fine Cloth for him to tread on; but the humility of this Phariſee appeared ſuch, that he would ſtoop and turn them aſide, and ſo paſs. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus fixed himſelf in the opinion and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:39539:92"/>of the people, he began to take on himſelf the Title of Meſſiah, and the Son of God, and to make this following Declaration to all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which being wrote Originally in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> was tranſlated for me faithfully into <hi>Italian</hi> in this manner.</p>

So that <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> returned to his houſe trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, fixed in the hearts of his People, who now needed no farther Miracles to confirm them in their Faith. And thus was <hi>Sabatai</hi> exalted, when no man was thought worthy of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, who did not believe him for the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah: others were called Kophrim, Infidels, or Hereticks, ſubjected to the Cenſure of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, with whom it was not lawful ſo much as to eat. Every man produced his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, his Gold, and Jewels, offering them at the feet of <hi>Sabatai;</hi> ſo that he could have commanded all the Wealth of <hi>Smyrna;</hi> but he was too ſubtle to accept their money, leſt he ſhould render his deſign ſuſpected by any acts of covetouſneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> having thus fully fixed himſelf in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and filled other places with the rumours of him, declared that he was called by God to viſit <hi>Canſtantinople,</hi> where the greateſt part of his work was to be accompliſhed; in order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he privately ſhipped himſelf with ſome few Attendants on a Turkiſh Saike in the month of <hi>January</hi> 1665, leſt the crowd of his Diſciples, and ſuch who would preſs to follow him, ſhould endanger him in the eyes of the Turks, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready began to be ſcardalized at the Reports and Prophecies concerning his Perſon But though <hi>Sabatai</hi> took few into the Veſſel with him, yet multitudes of Jews travelled over land to meet him again at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> on whom all their Eyes and expectations were intent. The Wind proving Northerly, as commonly it is in the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> and <hi>Propontis, Sabatai</hi> was thirty nine days in his Voyage, and yet the Veſſel not arrived: So little power had this Meſſiah over the Sea and Winds. In which time the News fore-running to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> that the Jews Meſſiah was near, all that people prepared to receive him with the ſame joy and impatience as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in other parts where he arrived. The Great Vizier then alſo at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (being not yet departed on his expedition for <hi>Gandia</hi>) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard ſome rumours of this Man, and the diſorder and madneſs he had raiſed amongſt the Jews, ſent two Boats, whilſt the Saik was detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by contrary Winds, with Commands to bring him up Priſoner to the Port, where accordingly <hi>Sabatai</hi> being come, was committed to the moſt loathſome and darkeſt Dungeon in the Town, there to remain in farther expectation of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers Sentence. The Jews were not at all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged at this ill Treatment of their Prophet, but rather confirmed in their belief of him, as being an accompliſhment of the Prophecy of thoſe things which ought to precede his Glory and Dominion; which Conſideration induced the Chiefeſt Perſons amongſt the Jews to make their Viſits and Addreſſes to him with the ſame Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Reſpect in the Dungeon, as they would have done, had he then ſate exalted on the ſublime Throne of <hi>Judah.</hi> Several of them, with one <hi>Anacago</hi> by name, a Man of great eſteem amongſt the Jews, attended a whole day before him, with their Eyes caſt down, their Bodies bending forward, and hands croſs'd before them; (which are poſtures of humllity and ſervice in the Eaſtern Parts) the undecency of the place, and preſent ſubjection, not having in the leaſt abated their high thoughts and reverence towards his perſon.</p>
                     <p>For the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> were become as mad and diſtracted, as they were in other places, all Trade and Traffick forbidden, and thoſe who owed Money, in no manner careful how to ſatisfie it; amongſt which wild Crew, ſome were indebted to our Merchants at <hi>Galata,</hi> who not knowing the way to receive their Money, partly for their intereſt, and partly for curioſity, thought fit to viſit this <hi>Sabatai,</hi> complaining, That ſuch particular <hi>Jews,</hi> upon his Coming, took upon them the boldneſs to defraud them of their right, and deſired he would be pleaſed to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie to thoſe his Subjects, his pleaſure to have ſatisfaction given.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon <hi>Sabatai,</hi> with much affectation, took Pen and Paper, and wrote to this effect.</p>

                     <p>In this manner <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> remained a Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for the ſpace of two Months; at the end of which the Vizier having deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his expedition for <hi>Candia,</hi> and conſidering the rumour and diſturbance the Preſence of <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai</hi> had made already at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> thought it not ſecure to ſuffer him to remain in the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial City, whilſt both the Grand Signior and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were abſent; and therefore changed his Priſon to the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> otherwiſe called the Caſtle of <hi>Abydos,</hi> being on the <hi>Europe</hi> ſide of the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Seſtos,</hi> places famous in <hi>Greek</hi> Poetry. This removal of <hi>Sabatai</hi> from a worſe Priſon, to one of a better Air, confirmed the <hi>Jews</hi> with greater confidence of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meſſiah, ſuppoſing that had it been in the power of the Vizier, or other Officers of the <hi>Turks,</hi> to have deſtroyed his Perſon, they would never have permitted him to live unto that time, in regard their Maximes enforce them to quit all jealouſies and ſuſpicions of ruine to their State by the death of the Party feared; which much rather they ought to execute on <hi>Sabatai,</hi> who had not only declared himſelf the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo by Prophecies publiſhed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal things to the Grand Signior and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
                     <p>With this Conſideration, and others prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, the <hi>Jews</hi> flocked in great numbers to the Caſtle, where he was impriſoned, not only from the Neighbouring parts, but alſo from <hi>Poland, Germany, Ligorn, Venice, Amſterdam,</hi> and other places, where the <hi>Jews</hi> reſide; on all whom, as a reward of the expence and labours of their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, <hi>Sabatai</hi> beſtowed plenty of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions, promiſing encreaſe of their Store, and enlargement of poſſeſſions in the Holy Land. So great was the confluence of the <hi>Jews</hi> to this place, that the <hi>Turks</hi> thought it requiſite to make their advantage thereof, and ſo not only raiſed the price of their Proviſions, Lodgings, and other neceſſaries, but alſo denied to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any to the preſence of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> unleſs for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, ſetting the price ſometimes at Five, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at ten Dollars, or more or leſs, according as they gueſſed at the abilities and zeal of the Perſon; by which gain and advantage to the <hi>Turks,</hi> no Complaints or Advices were carried to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> either of the Concourſe or Arguments

                     <p>During this time of Confinement <hi>Sabatai</hi> had leiſure to compoſe and inſtiture a New Method of Worſhip for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and principally the manner of the Celebration of the Day of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which he preſcribed in this manner.</p>

                     <p>Howſoever ſome of the <hi>Jews</hi> remained in their Wits all this time, amongſt which was a certain Cocham at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> one zealous of his Law, and of the good and ſafety of his Nation; and obſerving in what a wild manner the whole Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> was tranſported with the gronnd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs belief of a Meſſiah, leaving not only their Trades, and courſe of Living, but publiſhing Prophecies of a ſpeedy Kingdom, of reſcue from the tyranny of the <hi>Turk,</hi> and leading the Grand Signior himſelf captive in Chains; matters ſo dangerous, and obnoxious to the State wherein they lived, as might juſtly convict them of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Rebellion, and leave them to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that Juſtice, which on the leaſt jealouſie and ſuſpicion of matters of this nature, uſes to extirpate Families, and ſubvert the Manſion houſes of their own People, much rather of the <hi>Jews,</hi> on whom the <hi>Turks</hi> would gladly take this occaſion to deſpoil them of their Eſtates, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:39539:94"/>condemn the whole Nation to perpetual Slavery. And indeed it would have been a greater wonder than ever <hi>Sabatai</hi> ſhewed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> took not advantage from all theſe extravagancies to drain the <hi>Jews</hi> of a conſiderable Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſet their whole Race in <hi>Turky</hi> at a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, had not theſe paſſages yielded them matter of paſtime, and been the ſubject of the <hi>Turks</hi> laughter and ſcorn, ſuppoſing it a diſparagement to the greatneſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, to be concerned for the rumours and combuſtions of this deſpiſed People. With theſe Conſiderations this Cocham, that he might clear himſelf of the blood and guilt of his Countrymen, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the common deſtruction, went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Kaddee, and there proteſted againſt the preſent Doctrine, declaring, That he had no hand in ſetting up of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> but was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my both to him and his whole Sect. This free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Cocham ſo enraged and ſcandalized the <hi>Jews,</hi> that they judged no Condemnation or Puniſhment too ſevere againſt ſuch an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, and Blaſphemer of their Law, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of the Meſſiah, and therefore with Money and preſents to the Kaddee, accuſing him as diſobedient in a Capital nature to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, obtained ſentence againſt him to ſhave his Beard, and commit him to the Gallies.</p>
                     <p>There wanted nothing now to the appearance of the Meſſiah, and the Solemnity of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the preſence of <hi>Elias,</hi> which the <hi>Jews</hi> began to expect hourly, and with that attention and earneſtneſs, that a Dream or Phantaſm to every weak Head was judged to be <hi>Elias,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught and averred, that he was ſeen in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Forms and Shapes, not to be certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered or known before the Coming of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. For this Superiſtition is ſo far fixed amongſt them, that generally in their Families they ſpread a Table for <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet to which they make an invitation of poor People, leaving the chief place for the Lord <hi>Elias,</hi> whom they believe to be inviſibly preſent at the Entertainment, and there to eat and drink without diminution either of the Diſhes or the Cup. One Perſon amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> commanded his Wife, after a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of this kind, to leave the Cup filled with Wine, and the Meat ſtanding all Night for <hi>Elias</hi> to feaſt and rejoyce alone, and in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ariſing early, affirmed, That <hi>Elias</hi> took this Banquet ſo kindly, that in token of gratitude and acceptance, he had repleniſhed the Cup with Oyl inſtead of Wine. It is a cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> on the Evening of the Sabbath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat certain praiſes of God. <hi>(Haudola)</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a diſtinction or ſeparation of the Sabbath from the prophane days (as they call them;) which praiſes or bleſſing they obſerve to perform in this manner. One takes a Cup filled with Wine, and drops it through the whole Houſe in the name of <hi>Elias,</hi> ſaying, Elias <hi>the Prophet,</hi> Elias <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, come quickly to us with the Meſſiah the Son of</hi> David. And this, they affirm, is ſo acceptable to <hi>Elias,</hi> that he never fails to preſerve that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſo devoted to him, and augment it with the Bleſſings of encreaſe. Many other things the <hi>Jews</hi> avouch of <hi>Elias,</hi> ſo ridiculous, as are not neceſſary to be declared, amongſt which this one is not from our purpoſe, That at the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there is always a Chair ſet for <hi>Elias.</hi> And <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai Sevi</hi> being once invited at <hi>Smyrna</hi> to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of the firſt born Son of one <hi>Abraham Gutiere,</hi> a Kinſman of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and all things ready for the Ceremony; <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> exhorted the Parents of the Child to expect a while until his farther order. After a good half hour <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai</hi> ordered them to proceed, and cut the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pucee of the Child, which was inſtantly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all joy and ſatisfaction to the Parents: and being afterwards demanded, wherefore he retarded the performance of that Function; his anſwer was, That <hi>Elias</hi> had not as yet taken his Seat, whom as ſoon as he ſaw pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

This being the common opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai Sevi</hi> was the Meſſiah, being become an Article of Faith, it was not hard to perſwade them that <hi>Elias</hi> was come already, that they met him in their diſhes, in the dark, in their Bed-chambers, or any where elſe inviſible, in the ſame manner as our common People believe of Hobgoblins and Faries. For ſo it was, when one <hi>Solomon Cremona,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> making a great Feaſt, to which the principal <hi>Jews</hi> of that City were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, after they had eaten and drank freely, one ſtarted from his ſeat, and avouched that he ſaw <hi>Elias</hi> upon the VVall, and with that bows to him, and complements him with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility: ſome others having in like manner their fancies already prepoſſeſſed, and their eyes with the fume of VVine ill prepared to diſtinguiſh ſhadows, immediately agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the object, and then there was not one in the Company who would ſay, he did not ſee him; at which ſurpriſe every one was ſtruck with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and awe, and the moſt eloquent amongſt them having their tongues looſed with Joy and VVine, directed Orations, Encomiums, and acts of thankfulneſs to him, courting and complement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Elias,</hi> as diſtracted Lovers do the ſuppoſed preſence of their Miſtreſſes.</p>
                     <p>Another <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> reported, That he met <hi>Elias</hi> in the ſtreets, habited like a <hi>Turk,</hi> with whom he had a long communication, and that he injoin'd the obſervation of many neglected Ceremonies, and particularly the Zezit, <hi>Lev</hi> 15.38. <hi>Speak unto the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and bid them, that they make fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the border a Ribband of Blue.</hi> Alſo the Peotz, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Ye ſhall not round the corners of your Head, nor mar the corner of your Beard.</hi> This apparition of <hi>Elias</hi> being publiſhed, and as ſoon believed, every one began to obey the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by fringing their garments; and for their heads, though always ſhaved according to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and Eaſtern faſhion, and that the ſuffering hair to grow, to men not accuſtomed, was heavy and incommodions for their health and heads; yet to begin again to renew, as far as was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the ancient Ceremonies, every one nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Lock of hair on each ſide, which was viſible beneath their Caps, which ſoon after began to become a ſign of diſtinction between the Believers and the Koparims, a name of diſhonour, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as much as Unbelievers or Heretick, given to thoſe who confeſſed not <hi>Sabatai</hi> to be the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah. VVhich particulars, if not obſerved, it was declared as a menace of <hi>Elias,</hi> That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jews</hi> who came from the River <hi>Saba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as is ſpecified in the 2. <hi>Eſdras Cap.</hi> 13. ſhall take vengeance of thoſe who are guilty of theſe omiſſions.</p>
                     <p>But to return again to <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> himſelf, we find him ſtill remaining a Priſoner in the Caſtle of <hi>Abydos</hi> upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> admired and adored by his Brethren with more honour than before, and viſited by Pilgrims from all parts, where the Fame of the Coming of the Meſſiah had arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: Amongſt which one from <hi>Poland</hi> named <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:39539:94"/>Cohen</hi> was of ſpecial note and renown, learned in the <hi>Hebrew, Syriack,</hi> and <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and verſed in the Doctrine and Kabala of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, as well as <hi>Sabatai</hi> himſelf One (of whom it was ſaid) had not this <hi>Sevi</hi> anticipated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, eſteemed himſelf as able a Fellow for to act a Meſſiah as the other. Howſoever it being now too late to publiſh any ſuch pretence, <hi>Sabatai</hi> having already prepoſſeſſed the office, and with that the hearts and belief of the <hi>Jews, Nehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was contented with ſome ſmall appendage or relation to a Meſſiah; and therefore to lay his deſign the better, deſired a private Conference with <hi>Sabatai.</hi> Theſe two great Rabbins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, a hot Diſpute aroſe between them. For <hi>Cohen</hi> alledged, That according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Expoſition of the Learned thereupon, there were to be two Meſſiahs, one called <hi>Bon Ephraim,</hi> and the other <hi>Ben David:</hi> The firſt was to be a Preacher of the Law, poor and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and a Servant to the ſecond, and his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner; the other was to be great and rich, to reſtore the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to ſit upon the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> and to perform and act all thoſe Triumphs and Conqueſts, which were expected from <hi>Sabatai. Nehemiah</hi> was contented to be <hi>Ben Ephraim,</hi> the afflicted and poor Meſſiah, and <hi>Sabatai</hi> was well enough contented he ſhould be ſo; but that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> accuſed him for being too forward in publiſhing himſelf the latter Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, before <hi>Ben Ephraim</hi> had firſt been known to the World. <hi>Sabatai</hi> took this reprehenſion ſo ill, either out of pride and thoughts of his own Infallibility, or that he ſuſpected <hi>Nehemiah</hi> being once admitted for <hi>Ben Ephraim,</hi> would quickly, being a ſubtle and learned Perſon, perſwade the World that he was <hi>Ben David,</hi> would by no means underſtand or admit of this Doctrine, or of <hi>Ben Ephraim</hi> for a neceſſary Officer: And thereupon the Diſpute grew ſo hot, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie ſo irreconcileable, as was taken notice of by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and controverted amongſt them as every one fancied; but <hi>Sabatai</hi> being of greater Authority, his Sentence prevailed, and <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> was rejected as Schiſmatical, and an Enemy to the Meſſiah, which afterwards proved the ruine and downfal of this Impoſture. For <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> being thus baffled, and being a Perſon of Authority, and a haughty Spirit, meditated no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but revenge; to execute which to the full, he took a Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and there inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chief Miniſters of State and Officers of the Court, who (by reaſon of the gain the <hi>Turks</hi> made of their Priſoner at the Caſtle on the <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpont</hi>) heard nothing of all this concourſe of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Prophecies of the Revolt of the <hi>Jews</hi> from their obedience to the Grand Signior. And taking likewiſe to his Counſel ſome certain diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented and unbelieving Cochams, who being zealous for their Nation, and jealous of the ill conſequences of this long continued and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing madneſs, took liberty to inform the Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam (who was Deputy of the Great Vizier then at <hi>Candia</hi>) that the <hi>Jew,</hi> Priſoner at the Caſtle, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> was a lewd perſon, and one who endeavoured to debauch the minds of the <hi>Jews,</hi> &amp; divert them from their honeſt courſe of livelihood, &amp; obedience to the Grand Signior and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was neceſſary to clear the World of ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and dangerous a Spirit. The Chimacam be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus inform'd could do no leſs than acquaint the Gr. Signior with all the particulars of this mans condition, courſe of life, and Doctrine; which were no ſooner underſtood, but a Chaouſe or Meſſenger was immediately diſpatched to bring up <hi>Sabatai Sevi</hi> to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> The Chaouſe executed his Commiſſion after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion in haſte, bringing <hi>Sabatai</hi> in a few days to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> without farther excuſe or ceremony, not affording him an hours Space to take a ſolemn farewel of his Followers and Adorers, who now were come to the vertical point of all their hopes and expectations.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior having by this time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived divers informations of the madeſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the pretences of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> grew big with deſire and expectation to ſee him; ſo that he no ſooner arrived at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> but the ſame hour he was brought before the Grand Signior. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> appeared much dejected, and failing of that courage which he ſhewed in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. And being demanded ſeveral queſtions in Turkiſh by the Grand Signior, he would not truſt ſo far to the vertue of his Meſſiahſhip, as to deliver himſelf in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Language, but deſired a Doctor of Phyſick (who had from a <hi>Jew</hi> turned <hi>Turk</hi>) to be his Interpreter, which was granted to him, but not without reffection of the ſtanders-by, that had he been the Meſſiah and Son of God, as he formerly pretended, his Tongue would have been looſed into Eloquence and perfection of Languages. But the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior would not be put off without a Miracle, and it muſt be one or his own chuſing; which was, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> ſhould be ſtripped naked, and ſet as a mark to his dextrous Archets; if the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows paſſed not his body, but that his fleſh and skin was proof, like Armour, then he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the Meſſiah, and the Perſon whom God had deſigned to thoſe Dominions and Greatneſs he pretended. But now <hi>Sabatai</hi> not having Faith enough to ſtand to ſo ſharp a tryal, renounced all his Title to Kingdoms and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, alledging that he was an ordinary Cocham and Jew, as others were, and had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of priviledge and virtue above the reſt. The Grand Signior notwithſtanding, not wholly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this plain confeſſion, declared, That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given publick ſcandal to the Profeſſors of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Religion and done diſhonour to his Soveraign Authority, by pretending to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from him ſo conſiderable a portion as the Land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> his Treaſon and Crime could not be expiated without becoming a <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Convert: Which if he refuſed to do, the Stake was ready at the Gate of the Seraglio to impale him. <hi>Sabatai</hi> being now reduced to his laſt game and extremity, not being in the leaſt doubtful what to do, for to dye for what he was aſſured was falſe was againſt Nature, and the death of a mad man: Replied with much chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, that he was contented to turn <hi>Turk,</hi> and that it was not of force, but of choice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a long time deſirous of ſo glorious a profeſſion, he eſteemed himſelf much honoured, that he had an opportunity to own it firſt in the preſence of the Grand Signior. And here was the <hi>Non plus ultra</hi> of all the bluſter and noiſe of this vain Impoſtour. And now the Reader may pauſe a while, and contemplate the ſtrange point of conſternation, ſhame, and ſilence, to which the <hi>Jews</hi> were reduced, when they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood how ſpeedily their hopes were vaniſhed, and how poorly and ignominiouſly all their fancies and promiſes of a new Kingdom, their Pageantry and Offices for Devotion were paſt like a tale, or a midnights dream. And all this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the <hi>Jews</hi> sunk on a ſudden and fallen flat in their hopes, without ſo much as a line of comfort or excuſe from <hi>Sabatai,</hi> more than in general to all the Brethren, that now they ſhould apply themſelves to their callings and ſervices
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:39539:95"/>of God, as formerly; for that matters relating to him were finiſhed, and the ſentence paſt.</p>
                     <p>The News of <hi>Sabatai</hi> turning Turk, and of the Meſſiah to a Mahometan, quickly filled all parts of <hi>Turky;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtrangely ſurpriſed at it, and aſhamed of their eaſineſs of belief, of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments with which they had perſwaded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of the Proſelytes they had made in their own Families. Abroad they became the common deriſion of the Towns where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, the Boys houted after them, coining a new word at <hi>Smyrna (Pouftai)</hi> which every one ſeeing a Jew, with a ſinger pointed out, would pronounce with ſcorn and contempt; ſo that this deceived People for a long time after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with confuſion, ſilence, and dejection of ſpirit. And yet moſt of them affirm, That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> is not turned Turk, but his ſhadow only remains on Earth, and walks with a white head, and in the habit of a <hi>Mahometan;</hi> but that his Body and Soul are taken into Heaven, there to reſide until the time appointed for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Wonders: And this opinion began ſo commonly to take place, as if this People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved never to be undeceived, uſing the Forms and Rules for Devotion preſcribed them by their <hi>Mahometan</hi> Meſſiah. Inſomuch that the Cochams of <hi>Conſtantenople</hi> fearing the danger of this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour might creep up and equal the former, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the belief of <hi>Sabatai</hi> being Meſſiah as damnable, and injoyned them to return to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Method and Service of God, upon pain of Excommunication. The Stile and Tenour of their Letter was as followeth.</p>

                     <p>During the time of all theſe tranſactions and paſſages at <hi>Conſtantinople, Smyrna, Abydos</hi> upon the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and <hi>Adrianople;</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> leaving their mercantile courſe and advices what prices Commodities bore, and matters of Traffick, ſtuffed their Letters for <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts with nothing but wonders and miracles wrought by their Meſſiah. As that, when the Grand Signior ſent to take him, he cauſed all the meſſengers immediately to die; upon which, other Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries being again ſent, they all fell dead with a word only from his mouth; and being deſired to revive them again, he immediately recalled them to life, but of them only ſuch, who were true Turks, and not thoſe who had denied that Faith in which they were born, and had profeſſed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this they added, that he went voluntarily to Priſon, and though the Gates were barred, and ſhut with ſtrong Locks of Iron, yet that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was ſeen to walk through the ſtreets with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous attendance; and when they laid ſhac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles on his Neck and Feet, they not only fell from him, but were converted into Gold, with which he gratified his true and faithful Believers and diſciples. Some Miracles alſo were report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Nathan,</hi> that only at the reading of the name of any particular Man or Woman, he could immediately recount the ſtory of his or her Life, their ſins or defaults, and accordingly impoſe juſt correction and penance for them. Theſe ſtrong reports coming thus confidently into <hi>Italy,</hi> and all parts, the <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Caſal di Monferrato</hi> reſolv'd to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:39539:95"/>ſend Three perſons in behalf of their Society, in the nature of extraordinary Legates, to <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> to make enquiry after the truth of all theſe rumours, who accordingly arriving in <hi>Smyrna,</hi> full of expectation and hopes, intending to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves with great humility and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before their Meſſiah, and his Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> were entertained with the ſad news, that <hi>Sabatai</hi> was turned Turk; by which information, the Character of their Embaſſy in a manner ceaſing, every one of them laying aſide the formality of his Function, endeavoured to lodge himſelf beſt to his own convenience. But that they might return to their Brethren at home with the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain particulars of the ſucceſs of theſe affairs, they made a viſit to the Brother of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> who ſtill continued to perſwade them, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batai</hi> was notwithſtanding the true Meſſiah; that it was not he who had taken upon him the hahit and form of a Turk, but his Angel or Spirit, his Body being aſcended into Heaven, until God ſhall again ſee the ſeaſon and time to reſtore it; adding farther, that an effect hereof they ſhould ſee by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> verifyed, now every day expected, who having wrought Miracles in many places, would alſo for their conſolation, reveal hidden ſecrets unto them, with which they ſhould not only remain ſatisfied but aſtoniſhed: with this only hope of <hi>Nathan,</hi> theſe Legates were a little comforted, reſolving to attend his arrival, in regard they had a Letter to conſign into his hands, and according to their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were to demand of him the grounds he had for his Prophecies, and what aſſurance he had that he was divinely inſpired, and how thoſe things were revealed unto him, which he had committed to Paper, and diſperſed to all parts of the World.</p>
                     <p>At length <hi>Nathan</hi> arrived near <hi>Smyrna,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1666/7.</note> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 3d of <hi>March,</hi> towards the Evening, and on <hi>Sunday</hi> theſe Legats made their viſit to him, but <hi>Nathan</hi> upon the news of what ſucceſs his Meſſiah met with, began to grow ſullen and reſerved, ſo that the Legats could ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure admittance to him; all that they could do, was to inform him, that they had a Letter to him from the Brotherhood of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to confer with him concerning the ground and foundation of his Prophecies: But <hi>Nathan</hi> refuſed to take the Letter, ordering <hi>Kaim Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lafio,</hi> a Cocham of the City of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it; ſo that the Legats returned little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, but yet with hopes at <hi>Nathans</hi> arrival at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to receive better ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>But whilſt <hi>Nathan</hi> intended to enter into <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Cochams of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being before adviſed of his reſolution to take a Journey into their parts, not knowing by which way he might come, ſent their Letters and orders to <hi>Smyrna, Pruſſia,</hi> and every way round, to hinder his paſſage, and interrupt his Journey, fearing that things beginning now to compoſe, the Turks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed for the former diſorders, and the minds of the <hi>Jews</hi> in ſome manner ſetled, might be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and combuſtions burſt out afreſh by the appearance of this new Impoſtor, and therefore diſpatched this Letter as followeth.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <p>TO you who are the Shepherds of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Rulers, who reſide for the Great God of the whole World in the City of <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> which is a Mother in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to her Princes, her Prieſts, her Judges, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the perfect wiſe men, and of greateſt experience; may the Lord God cauſe you to live before him, and delight in the multitude of Peace, <hi>Amen.</hi> So be the will of the Lord.</p>
                           <p>Theſe our Letters are diſpatched unto you, to let you underſtand, that in the place of your Holineſs, we have heard, that the learned man which was in <hi>Gaza,</hi> called <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Benjamin,</hi> hath publiſhed vain Doctrines, and made the World tremble at his words and inventions. At this time we have received advice, that this man ſome days ſince depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Gaza,</hi> and took his Journey by the way of <hi>Scanderone,</hi> intending there to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for <hi>Smyrna.</hi> and thence to go to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> or <hi>Adrianople.</hi> And though it ſeems a ſtrange thing unto us, that any man ſhould have a deſire to throw himſelf into a place of flames and fire, and into the ſparks of Hell: Notwithſtanding, we ought to fear and ſuſpect it,<note place="margin">Arab. Prov.</note> for the feet of man always guide him to the worſt. <hi>Wherefore, we underwritten, do advertiſe you, that this Man coming within the Compaſs of your Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, you give a ſtop to his Journey, and not ſuffer him to proceed farther, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to return back. For we would have you know, That at his Coming he will begin again to move thoſe tumults, which have been cauſed through Dreams of a new Kingdom,</hi>
                              <note place="margin">Arab. Prov.</note> And that miracles are not wrought every day. God forbid, that by his Coming, the People of God ſhould be deſtroyed in all places where they are, of which he will be the firſt, whoſe blood be upon his own head; for in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture every little errour or fault is made Capital; you may remember the danger of the firſt Combuſtion, and it is very probable, that he will be an occaſion of greater, which the Tongue is not able to expreſs with words. And therefore, by virtue of ours, and your own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, you are to hinder him from proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing farther in his journey, upon pain of all thoſe Excommunications, which our Law can impoſe, and to force him to return back again, both he and his Company. But if he ſhall in any manner oppoſe you, and rebel againſt your word, your Endeavours and Law are ſufficient to hinder him, for it will be well for him, and for all <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>For the love of God, let theſe words enter into your ears, ſince they are not vain things, for the lives of all the <hi>Jews,</hi> and his alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt therein. And the Lord God behold from Heaven, and have pity upon his People <hi>Iſrael. Amen.</hi> So be his holy will written by thoſe who ſeek your Peace.</p>

In this manner <hi>Sabati</hi> paſſed his days in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Court, as ſome time <hi>Moſes</hi> did in that of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> and perhaps in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of him, caſt his eyes often on the Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Brethren, of whom, during his life, he continued to profeſs himſelf a Deliverer, but with that care and caution of giving ſcandal to the <hi>Turks,</hi> that he declared, Unleſs their Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like him, that is, renounce the Shadows, and imperfect Elements of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, which will be compleated by adherence to the <hi>Mahometan,</hi> and ſuch other Additions as his inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Wiſdom ſhould ſuggeſt, he ſhould never be able to prevail with God for them, or conduct them to the Holy Land of their Forefathers. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon many <hi>Jews</hi> flocked in, ſome as far as from <hi>Babylon, Jeruſalem,</hi> and other remote places, and caſting their Caps on the ground, in preſence of the Grand Signior, voluntarily profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Mahometans. Sabatai</hi> himſelf by theſe Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes gaining ground in the eſteem of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had priviledg granted him to viſit familiarly his Brethren, which he employed in Circumciſing their Children the Eighth day, according to the Precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> preaching his new Doctrines, by which he hath confirmed many in their Faith of his being the Meſſiah, and ſtartled all with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what theſe ſtrange ways of Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm may produce; but none durſt publickly own him, leſt they ſhould diſpleaſe the <hi>Turks,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> and incur the danger of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from one, and the Gallows from the other.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever in <hi>January</hi> 1671/2 appeared another bold Impoſtor amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Smyrna</hi> from the <hi>Morea,</hi> as it was ſaid, or not known from whence, who in deſpight of <hi>Sabatai,</hi> and his own Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pretended to be Meſſiah; but with ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and petty a Deluder as this, the <hi>Jews</hi> thought to make quick work; but being aſhamed at firſt to bring another Meſſiah on the Stage, by help of money they accuſed him of Adultery, and procured a Sentence from the Kadi, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to the Gallies; in order unto which, and in proof of his good behaviour he remain'd ſome time in Priſon, in which Interim he found means to clear himſelf of that Crime by open evidence to the contrary, and had for the preſent eſcaped out of the power of the Synagogue, had not their Authority &amp; money prevailed more than the Friends or Diſciples of this Impoſtor; whom we will leave in priſon, and <hi>Sabatai</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> where he continued until the Year 1676, and then died. And ſo we return to more important matters of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Affairs.</p>
                     <p>Since that we have ſo long inſiſted on the phrenſie of the <hi>Jews,</hi> let us return to matters of greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and more general concernment; &amp; look back to Count <hi>Leſlie</hi> the Emperors Ambaſſador, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving departed from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> of the laſt Year, we find on the 10th of <hi>March</hi> of this year on the Frontiers ready to make exchange with the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ambaſſador. The night before, Count <hi>Leſlie</hi> was lodged at a Village called <hi>Elmas,</hi> where the Inhabitants, as in the moſt parts of upper <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> are Calviniſts in Religion; and though the live between two Swords,<note place="margin">The manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors and <hi>Turks</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> do yet in time of War, by paying a Tribute to both Parties, and providing Forage for both, remain more ſecure than in the Villages ſubjected to either; which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten burnt, or in ſome other manner miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. The next day the Emperors Ambaſſador, conducted by the Paſha of <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hundred Horſe, arrived at the place for many years obſerved for exchange of Ambaſſadors, which is about an hour and halfs Journey, or five miles (as we may ſo ſay) diſtant from this Village, where in open Fields upon the Brink of the <hi>Danube,</hi> are ſet three Poſts; the two Ambaſſadors meeting at that in the middle, after ſome Complements, take their leaves each of other, and ſo exchange. The <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ambaſſador that day arrived near his Poſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven a Clock in the morning, but the <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> not being as yet come from <hi>Komara,</hi> he could not proceed farther. After ſome expectation here, advice came, That the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ambaſſador was reſolved not to depart from <hi>Komara</hi> until he was ſatisfied for the allowance of eighteen days, at a hundred Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars for every day, which he had ſpent at his entrance into <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> between the frontiers and the City of <hi>Vienna.</hi> But to this was replied, That it had never been the cuſtom to allow the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador mony for his daily proviſions, until he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Emperors Court; and in the mean time the expences and charge of his journey were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed by the Imperial Officers, who had performed the ſame in a moſt ample and plentiful manner: But the <hi>Turk</hi> was reſolved not to be ſo ſatisfied, and therefore declared he would not depart without full payment; hoping the more eaſily to prevail, in regard the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſador was already in the Field, expoſed to the cold and ſharp weather, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proviſions either for himſelf, Attendance, or Horſes, whilſt the <hi>Turk</hi> remained warm in his Boat, accommodated with his Stove, and wrapt in his Furs, ſo that he hoped there might be a neceſſity of granting what he reſerved for the rear-guard of his pretenſions. The matter ſeemed unreaſonable to the <hi>German</hi> Ambaſſador, as alſo to the <hi>Turks</hi> that attended him, who being in the open and cold Air, judg'd it in an unſeemly time to capitulate. But in fine, the <hi>German</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:39539:96"/>gave him this Anſwer. That an Ambaſſador ought to be contented with that hoſpitality and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was accuſtomary, as he himſelf had done; for that ſince his departure from <hi>Buda,</hi> which was then ſeven days, he had not receiv'd one Aſper of allowance, reſting ſatisfied with the Paſha's word, that from <hi>Buda</hi> homewards it was not accuſtomary to receive a farther treatment; ſo that if he inſiſted on the firſt, he was to be allowed the latter, ſince both Ambaſſadours are to be uſed with terms of equality; and therefore to find an expedient to give him ſatisfaction, he was contented reſign his ſeven days allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Grand Signior; and if any thing farther was really owing he would engage his parole of honour for the payment. And farther he added. That none but a corrupt Miniſter would make his private Intereſt to ſtand in Competition with a publick Deſign, and make the pretence of a few Dollars an interruption and impediment to the progreeſs of the great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Two Empires, profeſſing that he would have quitted all his right, rather than the leaſt concernment of his Maſter ſhould have received a prejudice, on confidence of whoſe gracious favour he depended for reparation of whatſoever he ſuffered for his ſervice. He thanked God that he had happily managed his Embaſſy to the ſatisfaction of the Grand Signior, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of his Maſter, and was now ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the laſt office and ceremony, in which if he did fail, or was impeded, the fault was not his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to return to <hi>Buda,</hi> ſo the other in like manner did to <hi>Vienna,</hi> there to remain until this difference was decided by their Maſters. The Turkiſh Ambaſſadour's Kahya or Steward who was preſent, and heard all this diſcourſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not pleaſed to hear of a return to <hi>Vienna,</hi> immediately replied, That he conceived his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would not remove from <hi>Komara;</hi> to which it was anſwered, That a man who ſo little underſtood the office of an Ambaſſadour, as it appeared his Maſter did, was to be treated with ſome other kind of ſtile than was agreeable to the reſpect due to a publick Miniſter, and ſhould therefore be forced to it in caſe he ſhould refuſe. The Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Ambaſſadour having his ſtomach ſomething taken down with the threats of returning to <hi>Vienna,</hi> that afternoon looſed from <hi>Komara,</hi> and between three and four a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The German Ambaſſadour was more moved with choler at this humor than at the former; and the Turks that attended, growing more hungry and more cold, beſtowed on him a million of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Sun now declining towards its ſetting, Count <hi>Leſlie</hi> ſent word to the Turk, That he was reſolved not longer to abuſe his own patience, but immediately to proceed forward, giving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Coach to drive on, proteſting, That if any miſchief was derived from this irregular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the fault was not his, nor would he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for any of thoſe fatal conſequences which might enſue; to which alſo being added ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of the Paſha of <hi>Quin<expan>

The Turks were drawn up on their own Quarter to the number of about three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and the Hungarian Huſſars or Horſe-men on the other to about two hundred; the two Ambaſſadours making a ſtand at their reſpective Poles, proceeded with equal paces to meet in the middle, where ſome few Complements having paſſed between them, and Salutes interchangeably ſent to the chief Miniſters of each Empire, the German Ambaſſadour entred his Coach, and the Turk his Boat, and ſo both returned to their reſpective Courts. Such as was the ſordid and intereſſed humour of the Turkiſh Ambaſſadour in this tranſaction, ſo no leſs diſhonourable was his way of living at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he ſo journed with that miſerable famine and penury in his houſe, as diſcontented all his family, cauſing ſome to leave him and return home; others with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter motives (as it is hoped) to the number of thirty became Chriſtians, and imbraced the Faith; at the ſame rate he was generous in his Preſents: for to the Maſter of the Houſe where he lodged he gave two five-Senars or eighteen Pence Engliſh, and to the Commiſſary who conducted him to the Frontiers, he preſented a Bag of Rice, which was not accepted but returned with the like comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that with which it was tendered.</p>
                     <p>But no ſooner was this Peace concluded,<note place="margin">The Turks meditate a new War.</note> and the Ceremonies thereof thus happily finiſhed, but the Turks, attentive to another War, which is the life of their Empire, and their only ſecurity againſt inteſtine Diſcords, made all the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Proviſions this Year, that were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for the total ſubjection of <hi>Candia,</hi> of which this Vizier was highly ambitious, deſigning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to gain unto himſelf that renown of which his Predeceſſours had been in purſuit for the ſpace of twenty five years; ſo that all Ammunition, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and whatſoever was neceſſary, was in great quantities ſupplied from all the circumjacent parts of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The City of <hi>Candia</hi> was ſome time before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Proveditor <hi>Priuli;</hi> but afterwards the Venetians, apprehenſive of the ſucceeding War, conferred the Charge on Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> a worthy and experienced Souldier, with Title of General of the Venetian Infantry, as we have before intimated; and having left him and his Forces in the month of <hi>December</hi> laſt, on the Iſland of <hi>Paros;</hi> where having, as is ſaid, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered his Forces, he imbarked them on ſixteen Gallies, five Galleaſſes, and thirty five Men of War; with which ſailing in company from <hi>Anti-Paros,</hi> the whole Fleet on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> made their Rendezvous at <hi>Argentiera;</hi> during which time the Turks landed eighteen hundred Janiſaries at <hi>Canea,</hi> being tranſported thither on thirty five Gallies, which having incountred with the Cavalier <hi>Hoquincourt</hi> in the channel of <hi>Scio,</hi> received ſome damage and loſs of men in their way, though this Cavalier himſelf was wounded in the Engagement, and forty of his men ſlain. The Venetian Fleet departing from <hi>Argentiera</hi> on the <hi>23th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> came in ſight of <hi>Candia,</hi> when a very great ſtorm ariſing with Thunder and Lightning, put the whole fleet in danger of ſhipwrack; but by Gods Providence, though toſſed with contrary winds, they arrived on the <hi>26th</hi> in ſafety in the Port of <hi>Suda,</hi> being directed thither in a dark night, by thoſe Lights which the Fortreſs had put abroad, though the Turks on the other ſide had put out falſe Fires to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them. The Army being landed at this place, and a Muſter made of the Forces, Pay was given to the Souldiery; with which being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the more couragious, they marched towards <hi>Canea,</hi> with hopes to perform ſome memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enterpriſe at that place. The Lieutenant-General <hi>Vuerſmiller</hi> led the Van,<note place="margin">An En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement near <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea.</hi>
                        </note> conſiſting of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundred Foot, and an hundred and eighty Horſe,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:39539:97"/>and advancing beyond thoſe bounds which Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> had preſcribed him, was incountred by a more numerous Force from the Garriſon, by which being at firſt put into ſome diſorder, had been intirely defeated, had not the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs opportunely arrived to his Succour: howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Venetians loſt in this Skirmiſh three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers, forty Horſe, and twelve Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, amongſt which the Murqueſs <hi>Ceva</hi> was ſlain upon the place, and Captain <hi>Scot</hi> a Scoth man taken Priſoner, whom the Engliſh Factory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> of the Turks ſeven hundred were computed to have been killed, with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga of the Janiſaries, a ſtout and a well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Souldier. And as this beginning was not very auſpicious to the Chriſtians, ſo neither did the Heavens ſeem much to favour them; for an unuſual rain with few fair days continued almoſt for the ſpace of three months, which filled all Rivers, Marſhes, and Ditches with ſo ſtrange an inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Army beginning to want Forage for the Horſes, and all other Proviſions for their Men; and the Garriſon of <hi>Canea</hi> being reinforced from <hi>Retimo, Chiramo, Armiro,</hi> and other places, diſcouraged the Commanders in that manner, that they thought it more convenient to retire and incamp in the pleaſant and fruitful Vallies of <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> until better weather, and other Recruits of their Army ſhould open a way either to make another Attempt on <hi>Canea,</hi> or new <hi>Candia.</hi> But Fortune did not favour theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; for the Captain-general <hi>Andrea Cornaro</hi> arriving with his Fleet, part at <hi>Candia,</hi> and part at <hi>Standia,</hi> (which is an Iſland or Rock about two Leagues diſtant from this City) a new reſolution was taken to remain on the defenſive part, and to attend wholly to the guard of the City: for as in the natural body, upon it is aſſaulted by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and hot humors, the ſpirits retire to the heart to comfort and ſecure that from the violence of the diſtemper; ſo the Venetians perceiving that their Enemies daily grew more numerous, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to contract their Force into one Body for defence of that City, which was the heart or the moſt principal inſtrument of life in that Iſland: Wherefore Recruits both of Men, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and Proviſions were daily ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Captain of the Gulf arriving at <hi>Suda</hi> with eleven Gallies and one Galleaſs, carrying fifteen hundred Soldiers, with three hundred Pioniere, joyned his Forces to the Body of the Fleet; and all imbarking in divers Squadrons, made haſte to land their men in the City of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                     <p>The Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> landed here the firſt of <hi>March,</hi>

The Captain-General by this time arriving with the remainder of the Militia, a general Muſter was made in the Trenches of the Fort <hi>Panigra;</hi> of which the Turks having advice, fell unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly upon them with a ſtrong Body; the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians being ſurpriſed hereat; and <hi>Verſama</hi> a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Collonel being ſlain, they began ſhamefully to run, nor could either the Bravery of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs or his Authority ſtop their flight; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Musket-ſhot and great great Guns from the Walls were ſo plentifully beſtowed on the Turks, that few of thoſe who were over-ſorward in the purfuit, returned to their Companions.</p>

                     <p>About this time advice being come to the Captain-General, That the <hi>Turks</hi> were diſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fifty Gallies laden with Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, he reſolved to incounter them at Sea with four Galleaſſes, and twenty Gallies, reinforcing his Fleet with twelve hundred men, which he took from the Camp; which being thereby conſiderably diminiſhed, as alſo by the late Engagements: yet Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> kept his ground, but contracted the compaſs of his Trenches, and raiſed a Fort in ſight of the Enemy, who had not the courage to give him the leaſt interruption; but rather after this example fortified their own Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſhutting all Avenues or paſſages to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negadoes, whom they ſuſpected might fly, and give advice to the Chriſtians: howſoever ſome of them eſcaped to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Camp, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that the Cannon from the Town did much incommode the <hi>Turks</hi> in their Trenches; upon which Intelligence Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty eight ſhot to be made at that place, where they were moſt offended, which put the <hi>Turks</hi> into great conſternation: after which no conſiderable Engagements happened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome few Skirmiſhes and Rencounters of no memorable note, in which one <hi>Antiquario</hi> a Quarter-maſter, Count <hi>Pio Ferretti,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſignalized themſelves by particular Acts of Valour, as alſo Captain <hi>Vimes</hi> who killed <hi>Mehmet Bey,</hi> a <hi>Turk</hi> of great eſteem, with his own hand.</p>

But what conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures ſoever envious men might make of the Conduct of Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> yet the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> applauded his labours, and owned his ſervices, as being ſuch, which having merited the admiration and eſteem of all the World, did in a particular manner challenge their thankfulneſs and acknowledgments. About this time the Gallies of <hi>Malta</hi> arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> where ſome diſpute ariſing touching the place of precedence in the Fleet, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> denied to them: they departed thence with ſome diſſatisfaction, and returned to the Weſtward to tranſport the young Empreſs out of <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Italy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now intelligence coming to <hi>Candia</hi> by divers Letters, that the Great Vizier was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Adrinaople</hi> with a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and was already arrived at <hi>Thebes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Great Vizier ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives at <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                        </note> where a general Rendezvous was appointed of the whole Army, with reſolution to be tranſported from <hi>Malvoiſin</hi> to that Iſland; the <hi>Venetian</hi> Generals and Commanders in chief concluded in neceſſary, if poſſible, to hinder their paſſage, and rather to fight them at Sea, which was their more propitious Element, than to attend their Landing, where they would be forced to diſpute with unequal numbers, and on diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous terms. Accordingly the Captain-General reinforced his Fleet with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot, and a thouſand Horſe under the Command of Count <hi>Licinio Martinoni,</hi> appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Rendezvous to be at <hi>Argentiera,</hi> to which place alſo Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> repaired, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way at <hi>Milo</hi> for refreſhment of his Horſe, it being an Iſland abounding with Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage; the Captain General being for ſome days detained at <hi>Standia</hi> by contrary Winds, a Conſultation was held for the more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous management of the War; after which the whole Fleet making Sail, was on <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ninth ſcattered by a furious ſtorm, and not being able to recover <hi>Santoxini,</hi> they by good fortune ſetched <hi>Stampalia,</hi> an Iſland abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with generous Wines, excellent Fruit, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, and other Proviſions; at length after various fortunes arriving at <hi>Andra,</hi> which is a great and populous Iſland, another Council of War was held, where it was again concluded, That all care was to be taken to intercept the Succours which the Enemy daily ſent to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> to which end the Cavalier <hi>Grimani,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Galleons, was ordered to cruiſe about the Coaſt; and hearing that twelve <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Ships were lading Proviſions in the Gulf

                     <p>By this time the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army being at their Rendezvous at <hi>Thebes,</hi> the Great Vizier prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to imbark; and conſidering the difficulty of the paſſage, thought it prudent firſt to make new Propoſitions to Signior <hi>Ballarino</hi> before he entred on this hazardous attempt, ſuppoſing perhaps, that the rumour of this March might have affrighted the <hi>Venetians</hi> to a Surrender of that Kingdom, that they might ſpare the blood and charge of that War which afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued: Wherefore <hi>Ballarino</hi> being called from his Houſe at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> began his Journey towards <hi>Thebes</hi> on the twentyfifth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> accompanied by a Capugibaſhee, and three Janizaries: and in twenty three days arriving at <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> now called <hi>Salonica,</hi> he fell ſick of a violent Feaver, cauſed by that agitation of body in his Travels to which he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed, and for want of that ſleep which he uſed to take after his ſlender dinner, paſſing the reſt of the day and night in continual watchings: at firſt he felt only ſome little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, which he hoping might paſs over, reſolved to proceed on his Journey notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the perſwaſions to the contrary of Signior <hi>Patavino</hi> his Secretary, with whom I was well acquainted, and ever eſteemed for an honeſt and a worthy Perſon: but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued reſolute to proceed, fearing leſt his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays by the way ſhould loſe him the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of that moment of Treaty, which was impoſſible afterward to be retrieved; for in his Journey he would often reaſon in this manner: If I ſhould ſtop here, what cenſure would the World paſs on me? I may poſſibly excuſe my ſelf; but in the mean time the Vizier may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage too far in his deſign, and fruſtrate all thoſe methods and foundations which I have laid towards a Peace: and then if I live, I ſhall be over-burdened with the reproaches of the World, for having abandoned the grand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbance in its ultimate neceſſity, which is charged upon me, which will be a more ſenſible affliction than the agony of death. My ſickneſs will be eſteemed by many to be rather diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled than real. The dead man lives in the memory of his faithfulneſs and conſtancy, and the living man dies in the indelible characters of his cowardiſe and misfortune. Theſe were his own words.</p>
                     <p>And thus travelling forward his Feaver dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſed to that exceſs, that on the ſixth day he was forced to ſtop at a City called <hi>Iſdino,</hi> where having inſtructed Signior <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino</hi> in what manner he ought to manage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and recommending his ſervices and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the favour and protection of the Senate, he paſſed to the other World, being honoured by a ſolemn Funeral at the publick Expence, and Interred in the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> his Son <hi>Domenico Ballarino</hi> ſucceeding into the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Inheritance of his Father.

                     <p>In the mean time the Princes of Chriſtendom being for the moſt part either in that diſcord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, of which the <hi>Turks</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made their advantage; or elſe living in parts remote, did not conſider <hi>Candia</hi> as a Pulwaik to their Dominions, and therefore rendred little other aſſiſtance to the <hi>Venetians</hi> than good words, and vain wiſhes for their ſucceſs and Victory. The Popes Forces only under Command of <hi>Muzeo Mattei</hi> which were in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> were tranſported to <hi>Candia,</hi> and five hundred Foot belonging to the Grand Duke of <hi>Toſcany,</hi> came into their places for deſence of that Country. The moſt Chriſtian King in return to the Embaſſy of <hi>Venice</hi> performed by the Cavalier <hi>Alviſe Sagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> remitted to that Republick an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns, and Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi> at his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſupplied four thouſand Meaſures of Corn. But the preſent Conjuncture did not ſeem to ſmile on the <hi>Venetians,</hi> for all the Gallies belonging to <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> as well as thoſe of <hi>Malta,</hi> were employed in the Tranſportation of the new Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs <hi>Margerita</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The Pope was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and diſtracted with his own Domeſtick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. The Emperor was a young Bridegroom, and beſides the Diverſion which a Wife gave him from Cares, he apprehended that he might ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive ſome diſturbance from the Princes of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and from <hi>Sweden</hi> in the Dukedom of <hi>Bremen.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was a Child of five years old, labouring at the ſame time under a War with <hi>Portugal,</hi> and threatned by the more powerful Arms of <hi>France,</hi> on the pretence of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> Beſides all which, the <hi>Turks</hi> were as well in quietneſs amongſt themſelves, as they were at peace with all other Princes; ſo that we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the force and power of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ſhould now be turned, like a Torrent, to overwhelm this ſpot of Land, which ſeemed to be ſo ſituated, as well to reſiſt the Waves of the Seas, as the Inundation of this mighty and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial People.</p>

                     <p>AT the Beginning of this year the Winter and Cold which chilled and benumbed the Earth, encreaſed the heat, and gave vigour and action to the Tartars, who made ſuch an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected incurſion into <hi>Poland,</hi> that they carried with them near a hundred thouſand captived Souls, as they were numbred before <hi>Jaſh,</hi> in their return home. The Polanders, awakened hereat, but ill adviſed, reſolved on a Treaty where there was more juſt cauſe for an open War, and in order thereunto diſpeeded an Ambaſſadour to the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to expoſtulate the reaſon of this breach of Peace, and require juſtice and ſatisfaction on thoſe his Subjects, who had, contrary to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace., committed ſuch actions, and outrages of open hoſtility; or at leaſt, that the Turk would not take upon him to abet the cauſe of the Tartars, whilſt the olanders took juſt revenge for their late injuries. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour with this Moſſage put himſelf in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, and with a retinue of about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Perſons, begun his Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>April,</hi> and on the ſecond of <hi>May</hi> croſſed the River <hi>Nieſtro,</hi> which divides <hi>Poland</hi> from <hi>Moldavia,</hi> where he was received by two of the Boiars, or Moldavian Noblemen, and thence conducted to <hi>Jaſh,</hi> where the Prince of that Country reſided. The Ambaſſadour expected the Viſit of the Prince, according to Cuſtom and Articles of Peace; but the Prince being either forbidden by the Port, or rather out of an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſtiffneſs and pride, omitted to paſs the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of that Office, but yet ſupplied the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour with Plenty of Wine and Proviſions; which the Polanders enjoying freely, diſpenſed perhaps more eaſily with other neglects and omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which concerned Formalities and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
                     <p>The ninth of <hi>June</hi> the Ambaſſadour arrived at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and thence was called to <hi>Demitochum,</hi> a City about a days Journey diſtant, where the Grand Signior, for the ſake of his hunting and divertiſement, remained under Tents, as the moſt convenient Lodging in that Seaſon of the Year;<note place="margin">By the number of Coftans is to be eſteemed the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Turks bear to one Prince above the other.</note> the <hi>25th</hi> the Ambaſſadour had his firſt Audience with the Chimacam, at which thirty five of his Retinue were veſted with Coftans, nothing paſſing but the uſual Ceremonies and Complements.

                     <p>Theſe Preſents preceding,<note place="margin">The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours Audience.</note> made way for the Ambaſſadours Audience, at which he declared, That the Commiſſion from his Maſter the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> was to make Complaints unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the grand Incurſions the Tartars had made into <hi>Poland</hi> without any reaſon or cauſe of War; and that therefore his Maſter did expect from him, as from a juſt and vertuous Prince, a permiſſion for revenge, and ſatisfaction of his injuries, to enter <hi>Tartary,</hi> without aſſuming it as any ground of Breach or Infringement of that Peace which he held with him; or elſe that he would by his authority enjoyn the Tartars to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore their Captives, and their ſpoils, and render them a reaſonable ſatisfaction. The Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior returned no reply hereunto, but referred that to be done by his Chimacam, ſilence being eſteemed ſome part of his Majeſty and State, which he ſeldom breaks but with few and haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty words.</p>
                     <p>This Ambaſſadour was a man of a bold and daring Spirit, a fit Orator for ſuch an Embaſſy, had not his immoderate Covetouſneſs, the Vice and Folly commonly incident to Old Age, much eclipſed many of thoſe Vertues of which he was Maſter. He was alſo a Man of a violent temper, feavered to a madneſs in the height of his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, which ſtrangely betrayed him to many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies in his Language and Comportment. For at his Audience with the Chimacam, when he came to receive the Grand Signior's Anſwer, his words were vented with that heat, and ſo like to menaces, that the Turks taking exception thereat, returned his courſe Speeches with the like Dialect, at which the Ambaſſadour ſwelled with that indignation and anger, as became not the Moderation and Gravity of his Office; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Concluſion, That he was an Aged Man, full of Years and Corporal Infirmities; that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could arrive more happy to him than a Death in which he ſhould triumph to ſuffer for the benefit and glory of his Country. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and intemperance of Language moved the Turks to ſet a Guard upon him, and confine him to his own Houſe in the nature of a Priſoner; which violation of his Sacred Office, ſo worked upon his Spirits, that he often vented ſome part of his fury in words and blows on the Officers of his Guard; for which rude behaviour having received ſome reproofs from the Chimacam,<note place="margin">The Death of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> his paſſion not knowing which way to eaſe it ſelf, feavered him into a deſperate ſickneſs, of which in a few days, phrenſical and diſtracted, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted his life.</p>
                     <p>The Secretary of the Embaſſy, being the next in Office, took upon him the Function and Charge of the Ambaſſadour, and having now nothing to act, but to receive the Anſwer to the Meſſage of his Maſter, for which a Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed, he was preſented with a Horſe and Furniture by the Chimacam, of whom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Audience, he received no other ſatisfaction to the Complaints againſt the Tartars than theſe following, which were related to me by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of the Embaſſy, who did me the honour to make me a Viſit, when I was on my recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from a dangerous Sicknes, at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, That no compenſation or pretence be ever hereafter demanded for the late incurſions made by the Tartars into <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the Polanders make not War upon the Coſſacks, who had lately renounced their ſubjection, and were fled for protection to the Ottoman Power.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Poles immediately make War upon the Muſcovite.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the Turk Merchants have free Trade into <hi>Poland,</hi> and that the Turkiſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants receive ſatisfaction for what injuries and loſſes they lately ſuffered.</p>

                     <p>With theſe Propoſitions and Conditions of Peace, the Secretary was diſpatched, which did not ſo well pleaſe the Poles as to return thanks for them, or a Meſſenger with Advice of their Acceptance or Ratification; and though they could not but be ſenſible of the ſcorn and yoke the Turks would impoſe upon them, yet having ſtill remaining amongſt them certain Reliques of their former diſſentions and diverſity about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Succeſſour to their King, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a certain Spirit of Luxury, Pride, and Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was crept in amongſt the Nobility, they conſidered not the advantage of the preſent time, but willingly preferred a preſent eaſe, and enjoyment of their Feaſts and Banquets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hazards and uncertainties of benefit, which they might receive by the doubtful lot and fortune of War; and though never any Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon appeared more opportune and advantageous to the Pole than this, when the flower of the Turkiſh Youth and Force was employed in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and all places, in part, diſmantled of their uſual ſtrength and complement of Souldiers to defend their Frontiers; yet they ſeemed reſolved to paſs by the former Incurſions, and Spoils, and Robberies made on their People, ſo the Turk would but ſtop here, and permit them, without farther provocation, to enjoy their quiet, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched way of living: Only ſome of the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers on the Turks, who had deeply ſuffered by the late Incurſions, moved with the loſs of their Eſtates, and the Captivity of their neareſt Relations, joyned with a conſiderable number of the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, entered <hi>Tartary</hi> in the months of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November,</hi> and burned about three hundred Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, carrying away Captives, and other prey, from under the very Walls of <hi>Coffa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At this time alſo the Paſha of <hi>Balſora</hi> began new rumours and an unſeaſonable Rebellions,<note place="margin">The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the Paſha of <hi>Balſora.</hi>
                        </note> who being reported to have an Army of Horſe and Foot conſiſting of forty thouſand men, gave no ſmall diſturbance and apprehenſion to the Turks; who with their difficulties of War in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the jealouſies of a ſtorm from <hi>Poland,</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome doubts and heſitancy about the way of their proceedings. At length Orders were diſpatched to the Paſhaws of <hi>Erzirum, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leppo, Damaſcus,</hi> and <hi>Darbequier,</hi> to unite againſt the Rebel, to diveſt him of his Government, and to ſend his forfeited head to his Maſter. Theſe Paſhaws accordingly joining their Forces, defeated the Rebel; and as all Conſpiracies of open Rebellion diſtant from the Court, have had but ill ſucceſs in theſe Countries againſt the true Prince, ſo this Paſha was routed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forſaken by his Servants, fled with a few Horſe to the Protection of the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> The principal Cauſe which moved the Paſha of <hi>Balſora</hi> (as I was informed from the mouth of the Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus</hi>) to this Rebellion, was the Confidence he had in his own ſtrength, and the fidelity of his people, to whom of ancient right, that Government was of hereditary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, deſcended to him by his Anceſtors for many Generations: by which means he challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch abſolute intereſt in his Principality, that for many Years he refuſed to acknowledge the Grand Signior by any other tokens of homage, than in the bare name of his Protector, and in making Publick Prayers for his Proſperity and Victories. But at length the Grand Signior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impoſe farther on him, ſtirred his hot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires into Rebellion, and to an open defiance.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of this Year the Captain-General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> with the Proveditor of the Armata <hi>Franceſco Barbaro,</hi> returned to <hi>Venice,</hi> bringing with them one <hi>Ramadam</hi> a Sangiack of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other Slaves taken by the Captains <hi>Grimani</hi> and <hi>Molini.</hi> The manner was this: <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madam,</hi> with three and twenty Ships, laden with Men and Ammunion, endeavoured to enter into <hi>Canea,</hi> but being charged by the Venetians, and overcome, ſet ſire to their Ship, and leaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Schiff to ſave their Lives, were taken by the Boat of <hi>Molino;</hi> and though fourteen Gallies came out of <hi>Canea</hi> to their aſſiſtance, yet they could not hinder the taking of five of their Ships, beſides ſeveral others which were put aſhore and ſtrand by four Malteſe Corſairs, who entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fight, being called at a diſtance by the ſound of the Cannon. About that time alſo a Turkiſh Gally was ſurrendred by the Induſtry and Ingenuity of the Slaves, who having ſecretly boared ſome holes in the bottom of the Gally, and plugged them up afterwards, ſo as that they might let in the Water, or ſtop it when they pleaſed; it happened that the Gally being near the Rock, which is called <hi>Polycandro,</hi> they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly drew out the plug, whereby ſo great a Flood of Water on a ſudden came in, that the Gally being ready to ſink, the Turks affrighted forſook the Gally to ſave themſelves on the Rock, leaving the Slaves in the Gally to ſhift as well as they could. The Slaves being thus freed of their Maſters the Turks, plugged up the hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> recalled Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> who was his Subject, from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> the reaſons for which was attributed to an appearance of Breach with <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Switzers and the Valtelines, who were his Subjects, or rather to the ill Offices of thoſe who envied his preferment, being deſirous to have him recalled from a place of ſo much honour and reputation. In obedience to this revocation Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> taking his leave of General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> returned from <hi>Candia</hi> as far as <hi>Zant;</hi> where meeting the new Captain General <hi>Franceſco Moraſidi,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him aſſured, That the Pope, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Venice</hi> repreſenting the difficulty of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>Candia,</hi> and the preſent urgency and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for his preſence there, had obtained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that employment; upon which aſſurance, Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> took a reſolution to return again to <hi>Candia,</hi> being accompanied with a ſtrong Squadran of Veſſels carrying conſiderable quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities both of Amunition and Proviſions.</p>

                        <p>At the beginning of the New Moon of this Year's <hi>May,</hi> being the 12/22th day of the month, publick Prayers being firſt made through the moſt principal places of the Empire for the ſucceſs of the Ottoman Arms, and ſo ſolemnly continued every <hi>Monday</hi> and <hi>Thurſday</hi> for the ſpace of a year; the Great Vizier firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the renowned Fortreſs of <hi>Candia,</hi> and began the memorable Siege of that City, which for the ſpace of twenty five years pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding had been the ſubject to which the ſpecial care and expence of <hi>Venice,</hi> and the Art of the moſt ſubtle Engineers of the World, as far as humanely was poſſible, did concur to render it the moſt impregnable Fortreſs of the Univerſe.</p>
                        <p>The Town was fortified with ſeven great Baſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Sabionera, Vetturi, Jeſus, Martinengo, Betlem, Panigra,</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> theſe were all incompaſſed with a large and deep Ditch, of which were the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> the Revelin of <hi>Panigra</hi> flanked to the right with the Half-moon of <hi>Mocenigo:</hi> next hereunto was the Revelin of <hi>Betlem</hi> bordering on the Work of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> which to the left had the Revelin of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the Fortification of <hi>de Palma,</hi> next whereunto was the Revelin of <hi>Priuli,</hi> with the Redoubt of <hi>Crepa-cuore;</hi> and over all was the Royal Fort of St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Work of <hi>Molino</hi> and <hi>Sabionera</hi> unto the very Sea.</p>

                        <p>Things thus diſpoſed on both ſides, many and various were the valiant Aſſaults and Sallies, the Traverſes extraordinary, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters bloody, the reſiſtance vigorous, not known or recorded in any Siege before; which though they can never be fully expreſſed, or particularly denoted, yet I ſhould do injury to the aſhes of thoſe Heroick Chriſtians who ſo freely entred the Liſt, and on this Theatre of the World ſacrificed their lives in defence of Chriſtendom, ſhould I not ſignalize ſome of them of divers Nations for their Proweſs and Valour. And here pardon me, good Reader, if I come ſhort or fail in this relation, where many of unparalleled Valour and Vertue dyed obſcurely and unknown, and the numbers of others ſo great, that to ſpecifie them all, were to ſwell this Work to a larger Volume than the Book of Martyrs. Here was that Martial field into which remote Nations and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned deſcended, carried thither by zeal to the Chriſtian cauſe, or by certain Principles of Valour and Magnanimity; ſo that though the War bore no other denomination than of the Venetian and the Turk, yet ſo great was the confluence of both parts of the World to this little Iſle, as if it had been choſen by unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conſent for a Stage to try the Title to the Univerſal Empire. The Town being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagured on all ſides, but where<note n="*" place="margin">The firſt Mine blown up.</note> 
                           <hi>Neptune</hi> the Spouſe of <hi>Venice</hi> kept it open, the Chriſtians endeavoured firſt to diſturb the Traverſes of the Turks by a Mine of Powder which they blew up; but through the neglect or little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of the Engineer, it being the firſt which they had fired, reverted, and did more hurt to themſelves than to the Enemy; the errour of which being obſerved, another For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello was fired, which taking its due place and meaſures, ſo affrighted the Turks, as yet not acquainted with this manner and invention of War, that they began at the firſt onſet to be diſcouraged, conſidering that if the ground was unſecure and unſtable at that diſtance what abyſſes and chaſmes muſt there be prepared to make them graves under the Walls or entrance to the City. To ſecond and juſtifie this Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Plot the Chriſtians made two Sallies, one by the Savoyards under Command of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Profito Torſe,</hi> who iſſued forth from the Revelin of <hi>Betlem,</hi> and made great ſlaughter of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:39539:100"/>the Turks with Granadoes on the ſide of <hi>Pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra;</hi> another was performed by Colonel <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borio</hi> and Colonel <hi>Marini,</hi> accompanied with Count <hi>Bruraſco</hi> Captain of the Guards to Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> who aſſaulted two Redouts of the Turks,<note place="margin">Two Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies made by the Chriſtians.</note> and forced them to flight, and afterwards with ſome loſs retreated victoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to their Works. In like manner Colonel <hi>Frigeri</hi> Commander of St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> made a Sally on <hi>Catirgi-Oglé</hi> near the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> and with ſome loſs returned triumphant.</p>
                        <p>About this time arrived at <hi>Standi</hi> the Captain-General <hi>Franceſco Moroſini,</hi> who after ſome Conſultation diſarming his Fleet of about a thouſand men,<note place="margin">The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſarms is Gallies.</note> entred with that Succour into the Town, and yet fitted out a convenient Squadron of Gallies and Galleaſſes to rove in the <hi>Archipelago</hi> to hinder the Enemies Succours and Recruits, which were deſigned for <hi>Candia.</hi> In this interim the Turks repaired the old Battery againſt the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi>

Wherefore the Turks made a farther tryal of two Mines by the Half-moon, rather to their own loſs, than to the damage of their Enemy.</p>
                        <p>In all the month of <hi>July</hi> paſſed not a day without ſome conſiderable action, ſometimes to good, ſometimes with bad ſucceſs to both Parties; every day Mines were ſprank on both ſides, deſtroying the Lines, and overthrowing the Galleries;<note place="margin">Attempts of the Turks on the ſide of <hi>Panigra.</hi>

In which whilſt he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, and endeavoured to cleanſe the Galleries of their rubbiſh, which the Enemies Mines had thrown down, the Turks threw ſuch quantities of Bomboes and Stink-pots into thoſe Caverns, as made the ſtench thereof ſo ſuffocating and noiſom, that two Officers were choaked or ſmothered that went to view the place, and Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Cavalli</hi> and the Engineer <hi>Caſtellan</hi> himſelf were brought away half dead, poyſoned with Sulphur and peſtiferous ſmoke; to purifie which Grota, nothing could render the air more wholeſom, in expulſion of the preceding vapour, than the ſmoke of Juniper and burnt Aqua vitae, which being made uſe of with good ſucceſs, the Chriſtians fired two Mines, which opened ſo dreadful an abyſs, as ſerved for the grave of great numbers of Infidels.<note place="margin">Arrival of Gallies from the Pope and <hi>Malta.</hi>

In all Enterpriſes this Perſon, worthily deſcended of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was a Companion to Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> and one day venturing on a deſign to diſturb the Enemies approaches, was ſhot in the face with a Musket-bullet; of which wound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering ſome time after, he with his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons returned to <hi>France</hi> having like Cavaliers Paſſant acted the parts of true Chivalry. But neither did the Prior <hi>Bichi</hi> Commander of the Popes Gallies, nor <hi>Doria</hi> Admiral of thoſe of <hi>Naples,</hi> act agreeable to the bravery of thoſe French Gentlemen; for they not only denied, as we have ſaid, to land a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their men, but as if they came only to make them a viſit, ſent this ſhort Letter of Advice dated the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in theſe words. <hi>The Auxiliary Gallies are obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this night and to return to</hi> Suda, <hi>where they are to remain until the expiration of that time which is appointed for them in theſe Seas.</hi> Prior <hi>Bichi</hi> likewiſe ſent word to Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> That he judged it fit to depart, by reaſon that no action preſented for them to undertake: to which the Marqueſs replied, That he who ſeeks may find, and that ſuch opportunities never offer to thoſe who endeavour to avoid them. <hi>Doria</hi> alſo, to colour his excuſes, ſaid, That his Orders were not to land men, unleſs the Town were in the extremity of danger of being taken; to which <hi>Villa</hi> replyed, That he could not well be aſſured in what condition the Town was, ſince he never vouchſafed to ſet his foot aſhore, or conceived a curioſity of ſeeing the greateſt and the moſt famous Siege that ever was in the World. In ſhort, theſe Holy and Catholick Squadrons departed without contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting any aſſiſtance to the Chriſtians, incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby the ſevere cenſure of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in chief, with the anger and diſdain of of the Souldiery.</p>
                        <p>The Venetians have always thought it Policy to maintain an Agent in the Ottoman Quarters, perhaps with deſign to afford them Intelligence, or to be ready to apply Terms of Peace in times of moſt urgent neceſſities.<note place="margin">An Agent arrives at <hi>Candia</hi> to treat with the Vizier.</note> According to which Rule Signior <hi>Giavarina</hi> was ſent to <hi>Candia</hi> upon the Venetian Armata, now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned at Sea by one <hi>Paſqualino,</hi> with Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to treat with the Vizier, and perhaps to grant him any thing beſides <hi>Candia,</hi> though without this nothing could come either wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or ſatisfactory to the Turks. Howſoever to introduce him into the Camp, a white Flag was diſplayed on the ſide of the <hi>Lazaretto;</hi> which when the Turks perceived, they flocked in great numbers to know the myſtery of this Signal of Pacification. And though nothing appeared, beſides a Letter directed to the Great Vizier, yet they hoped it might portend ſomething of Treaty, which in the end would produce a Peace, and a concluſion of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, before the Winter ſurpriſed them in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:39539:100"/>their colder Lodgings. The Vizier having read the Letter, had his thoughts raiſed as high as was poſſible in hopes of a Surrender; and therefore moſt freely ordered, That Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior <hi>Giavarina</hi> ſhould the Sunday following come to the Valley of <hi>Gioffiro</hi> with what Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and Followers he judged fit, proffering at the ſame time a ceſſation of Arms and all acts of Hoſtility: but the Chriſtians who were not reduced to that extremity as to crave Peace, or a reſpite from action, kindly refuſed his gentle proffer, which ſo inraged the Vizier, that in a fury he gave fire to a Mine on the left ſide of <hi>Panigra,</hi>

                        <p>At the end of this month of <hi>July</hi> the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon received a Supply of ſix hundred Foot under Command of <hi>Ottavio Abia,</hi> a noble Venetian, who likewiſe made his entry more acceptable by twenty thouſand Ducats which he brought with him. At the time of his arrival the Chriſtians fired a Mine with good ſucceſs, but the Enemy had prepared another in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which took ſuch effect on the right Angle of <hi>Panigra,</hi> as broke the Counterſcarp ten paces, and filled the Ditch with Earth, on advantage of which the Turks came to an Aſſault, but through the courage of <hi>Luca Grandis</hi> Serjeant Major, and other gallant Officers, a ſtop was given to the Enemies fury, and they beaten off with conſiderable loſs.</p>

                        <p>Nor was the ſucceſs of the Turks leſs on the ſide of <hi>Panigra,</hi> where having made a Breach, they endeavoured to make good their ground under ſhelter of Sacks of earth, which the Chriſtians drew away from them with long iron hooks, which was ſuch a piece of ſport to the beſieged to ſee their Enemies diſmantled of their ſhelter, and lye open to their ſhot, that a young Page of Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> called <hi>du Clos,</hi> venturing in this action beyond his years, was ſhot with a Musket Bullet in the head, and ſo haſtned to the other World covered with glory and renown.</p>
                        <p>There was ſcarce now a day which paſſed, that was not ſignalized with the ſpringing of ſeveral Mines both on one ſide and the other; moſt of thoſe made by the Chriſtians were ſeconded with Sallies, and thoſe of the Turks with Aſſaults and Stormings of one Fort or other. On the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> Signior <hi>da Riva,</hi> a noble Venetian, arrived with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of five hundred Souldiers, and a great number of Pioneers, and the ſame day was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, after the uſual manner, by ſpringing of Mines; one of which threw a Turk on the Fort of <hi>Panigra,</hi> and ruined the Galleries of the Enemy; the next day likewiſe ſeveral Fornelli were fired by the Enginier <hi>Lubatiers</hi> from the parts of the half Moon, and of <hi>Pani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gra,</hi> which filled up the Line, and ſpoiled the Redoubts of the Turks.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi>15th</hi> the Chriſtians vigorouſly ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out with ſeventy Foot, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Colonel <hi>Vechia,</hi> and two other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains from the Revelin of <hi>Panigra,</hi> who after a valiant skirmiſh, orderly retreated under the rampart of the Revelin; to which place the Turks eagerly purſuing them, were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with a Mine, and toſſed into the Air; which being done, the Venetians returned again, and were in the ſame manner encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Turks, whereby a very hot fight began; during which time the Captain General, who ſtood on the Baſtion of <hi>Betlem</hi> to obſerve the motions of the Enemy, ſaluted them with a plentiful ſhower of Musket ſhot. In ſhort, after the Venetians had for the ſpace of an hour reſiſted the Force of the Enemy with much ſlaughter, they retired with good order into the Ditch of the City.</p>
                        <p>On the <hi>18th</hi> Captain <hi>Fedeli,</hi> with a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Souldiers, made another Sally, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded, he retreated with ſome loſs; which was retured again on the Enemy by a Mine which the Enginier <hi>Quadruplani</hi> ſprang with happy ſucceſs on the Quarter of <hi>Panigra;</hi> and on the ſame day the Captain of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſſes, called <hi>Gioſeppe Moroſini,</hi> arriving with five hundred men, and two hundred thouſand Ducats together with good quantities of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Victuals, gave encouragement and relief to all the City; with whom alſo came the Cavalier <hi>Gonges</hi> and his Brother, in quality of Adventurers for Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.

Howſoever, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians deſiſted not from their intended work, but ſtill laboured with Baskets, Sacks, and Wheelbarrows to carry away the Earth; which that they might do quietly and undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, the Savoyards and Sclavonians made a furious and deſperate Sally, which continued for the ſpace of two hours; and though in that time the Enemy had opportunity to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their greater Force into a Body, yet the Chriſtians were not put to flight, but retreated orderly, and in a fighting poſture, though with the loſs of ſeveral Officers,<note place="margin">Two Mines of the Chriſtians.</note> of which were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Rè,</hi> and others.

                        <p>Yet the Turks were ſtill labouring to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the <hi>Fornelli</hi> of the Enemy, and to revenge the former Plots; to which end they had penetrated to the moſt inward works of <hi>Panigra;</hi> but the Pioniers, employed by the Engineer <hi>Quadruplani,</hi> diſcovering their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, entred boldly in, and drove away the Turks from whom they took thirty two Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder, and by that means for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent preſerved that work, and the Lives of many Souldiers.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the Chriſtians ſprang two Mines, one of thirty,<note place="margin">Two Mines of the Chriſtians.</note> and another of five and thirty Barrels of Powder, which did the deſired execution upon the Turks; which ſome brave ſpirits ſeconded by a bold Sally, amongſt which none was more eminent than a Greek Prieſt, who moved with zeal to his Country, entered far into the Enemies Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where having killed a Perſon of Quality hand to hand, he was returning with the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of his head; but being in the way inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by three at once, he was unequally matched, and ſlain, and died with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honour imaginable under the Walls of his Native City.</p>

The Great Vizier moved with this meſſage, reſolved to give ſome certain proofs of his induſtry and valour, and either to take the place, or elſe at leaſt to convince his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, by the knowledge and teſtimony of his Inquiſitor, that the Work was of more hazard and longer time than was apprehended in the Seraglio. Whereupon preparations were made, and the time of aſſault was appointed chiefly on the ſide of <hi>Panigra,</hi> ſo that preſſing valiantly forward, they planted ſix of their Colours on the ruines of that work; ſo that now, full of hope and courage, they adventured to deſcend into the Ditch, but being prevented by three
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:39539:101"/>Mines, which contained ſeventy Barrels of powder, they were mounted in the air with ſo much noiſe and violence, that many Bodies were toſſed on the Rampire of the Town, many of their greateſt Redoubts overthrown, and Graves made for multitudes of the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. This Aſſault as it began with great fury, ſo it continued for many hours; in which action Signior <hi>Piſani,</hi> Proveditor General of the Kingdom, was killed by a Granado. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Enemy was repulſed by the valour of the Chriſtians, inſomuch that the Turks growing faint were preſſed forward by the Vizier, who, to encourage his Souldiers, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed an extraordinary reward of honour and mony to him who ſhould but firſt touch the Walls with his hands. The hopes of riches and honour ſo pricked forward all conditions of the Souldiery, that the Commonalty deſperately threw themſelves at all, and endangered ſo fat the taking of <hi>Panigra,</hi> that they had certainly poſſeſſed themſelves of it, had not the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians had recourſe to their laſt refuge of Mines, and blown the whole Work into the Air, by which periſhed three Paſhaws, and great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of common Souldiers. And this for the preſent aſtoniſhed the Turks, and gave a ſtop to the farther proceedings of this Aſſault. This proof gave an evident Conviction to the Grand Signior's Inquiſitor of the ſtrength of the place, and difficulty of the Work; and having been an Eye-witneſs of all, returned with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Stories of a cruel War, reporting perhaps, and it was related in the parts of Chriſtendom, That this was a place where blood was ſpilt day and night, where Gallant Men had forgot to ſleep, living in perpetual labours, enured to intolerable ſufferings and hourly dangers, there being none ſecure either in the Church, in the houſe, or in the ſtreet; for Granadoes rained, Cannons thundred, Arrows flew, with ſtones like a Tempeſt; ſo that there was none in that place, but who quartered on the Brink of the Grave.</p>
                        <p>It now grew towards Winter, and yet the Vizier thought of no other Quarters than his Trenches, judging that if he ſhould quit his ſtation, the labours and progreſs of the former Summer would be loſt, and the Work to be again begun in the Spring. Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to keep his Works, provided all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances to carry away the Water, and ſheds to caſt off the Rain, and warmer Tents for the Soldiery, which yet could not ſo artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially be contrived, but that the Camp was full of mire and dirt, tedious and troubleſome to Man and Beaſt, and the Quarters of the Souldiery, ſo damp between their Banks of Earth, as cauſed Catarrhs, Fluxes, Feavers, and other Camp Diſeaſes with much mortality.</p>
                        <p>It was now the dead of Winter,<note place="margin">The Winter cauſes all Action to ceaſe.</note> and yet Martial Exploits were as frequent as they had been in Summer; and though the great rains and flouds of water extinguiſhed the fires, and made, as it were a ceſſation of Arms, and of all acts of hoſtility; yet this interval of calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tranquillity the Chriſtians made uſe of to repair the Paliſade of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and the Lines of Communication within the Ditch. And becauſe the main Bulwark was alſo ſhaken, and in ſome danger, all the Chiorma or Slaves of the Gallies were commanded a ſhore to labour in the reparation, and to make an inward retrenchment, which in ſhort time, with admirable diligence, was perſected, and on all ſides compleated.</p>
                        <p>The Turks in the mean time carried their Traverſes forward as much as they could, for they were now entered into the very Ditch of the Town; and becauſe there was no poſſibility to work in the Mines, by reaſon that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries were filled with water, they attended wholly to employ their great Guns, and fire Granadoes, ſo that they raiſed a new Eattery near the Work of <hi>Mocenigo,</hi> which began to batter the lower parts of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and raiſed another Battery on the ruines of the Revelin of <hi>Panigra,</hi> which being lower ground could not much prejudice the main Bulwark.</p>
                        <p>The Sultan ſatisfied with the Relation given by his Meſſenger concerning the progreſs his Vizier had made upon the Town, and of the hopes there was in time to gain it, encouraged him with a Letter of Praiſe, accompanied with a Sword, and Veſt of Sables, the magnificent Signal of the Sultans favour. And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Force of Fire-Arms, the Turks made uſe of Arrows, ſlot into the Town, carrying papers written in Italian and French, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the Souldiers to fly to their Camp, where they ſhould receive civil treatment, and a ſecure refuge; which gave that encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe wearied with the labours of the Siege and hard uſage, that many of them made Tryal of the Turks entertainment, and eſcaping out of the Works, fled to the Enemies Camp, where they were cloathed, received Conduct Mony, and were permitted Licence to embark themſelves for what place they pleaſed.</p>
                        <p>About this time the Proveditor General <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baro</hi> and the Lieutenant General of the Artillery <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>vertmiller</hi> having obtained licence from the Senate, returned to <hi>Venice;</hi> the firſt was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,<note place="margin">General <hi>Barbaro</hi> and <hi>Uvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miller</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from the Army.</note> that Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> ſhould take the precedence of him; and the other, becauſe his opinion of making a general Sally of all the Garriſon on the Enemy was not followed, but rejected by the Council of War, as a deſign pernicious and over-hazardous; for that the fighting with an Enemy more numerous than themſelves, fortified in their Redoubts and Works, and hidden under ground in inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Labyrinths, was an Enterpriſe ſo raſh, that no man wiſhing well to the Garriſon, and of ſound judgment ought to adviſe.</p>
                        <p>The Turks having in this Campagne fixed themſelves well in a formal Siege, and gained ground, and many advantages on the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, of which the deſtruction of the Work of <hi>Panigra</hi> was none of the leaſt: the Vizier ſuppoſed it a ſeaſonable time to enter into a Treaty by the hand of the Secretary <hi>Giavarina</hi> who was there entertained for that purpoſe but he falling ſick of the Camp-diſtemper dyed in a ſhort time,<note place="margin">The deaths of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary <hi>Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varina</hi> and <hi>Padavino.</hi>

The Inſtruments of Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus taken away, the Captain-Paſha was diſpatched to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> carrying with him four thouſand wounded and ſick men, and a Letter to the Grand Signior and Divan, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his reſolutions to win the place, or dye
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:39539:102"/>under the Walls of it; and to that end deſired them to ſend him ſuch Recruits of men and ſupply of Proviſions as were requiſite. He complained of the cowardiſe of thoſe to whom they had incharged the Convoys; that he wanted both Powder and Bullet, for default of which they could neither ply their great Guns, nor go forward in their Mines; that bread was ſo dear, that no price could be ſet to it; that his Souldiers by ſlaughter and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did daily diminiſh, ſo that his Army was reduced to twenty three thouſand Foot, ſeven hundred Horſe, and two thouſand Pioniers; and in fine concluded with urgent inſtances to have Recruits of all diſpeeded to him, without which it was impoſſible to gain the Town, or ſave himſelf. Hereupon Recruits came from all parts, both of Men, Ammunition, and Proviſions, eſpecially from the Frontiers or adjacent places, which by ſuch vaſt evacuations were almoſt diſpeopled, more particularly in <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Caſtelnuovo</hi> extraordinary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were making both of Men, Horſe, and Camels; and a report was ſpread, that the Grand Signior intended to paſs over in Perſon to <hi>Candia;</hi> but this was ſoon diſproved by his reſidence at <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where he remained to render aſſiſtance more eaſily, and receive advices more ſpeedily than could be performed at <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Great quantities of Corn were alſo ſent from divers places, particularly from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> where Engliſh, French, and Dutch Ships were taken up for that ſervice, to the prejudice of the Trade, and damage of the concerned: ſome of which Veſſels were taken in their paſſage to <hi>Candia,</hi> whilſt others arrived in ſafety through the negligence, as was ſuppoſed, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders at Sea. And indeed the Turks plyed their buſineſs with that induſtry and diligence, that notwithſtanding the Force which the Venetians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Howſoever great Actions at this ſeaſon ceaſed for a while on one ſide and the other, only continual diſcharges of great ſhot and Bomboes were practiſed. And the Turks endeavouring with artifice to cover their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, diſpatched a Letter to the Senate of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> by way of <hi>Suda,</hi> and thence in a Galley to <hi>Candia,</hi> touching certain Motives of Peace, ſuppoſing that Propoſitions and Offers of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation would looſen the minds of the Officers, and render them leſs intent and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen in their Affairs; on receipt of which Letter, though Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> replied, That he had as much power from the Senate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace, as the Vizier himſelf had from his Maſter, yet the Vizier would not treat with him, but ſent a Letter which was conſigned by an Aga at the Bulwark of <hi>Palma</hi> under the caution of a white Flag, deſiring that it ſhould be forwarded to <hi>Venice.</hi> About this time arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the great comfort of the Beſieged the new Proveditor <hi>Barnardo Nani</hi> with five hundred Souldiers, and <hi>Matteo Matheus</hi> Sergeant General with ſome Recruits from the Pope, bringing with him three hundred Medals of Silver to beſtow on ſuch as deſerved them, with Jubilees and Indulgences without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and thus ended the Action of this Year.</p>

                     <p>THE Spring approaching, toward the end of <hi>January</hi> the Turks full of hopes to compleat their Conqueſt, vigorouſly in all maritime Ports of the Empire made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Corn and other Victuals to be ſent to the Camp, when occaſion ſhould require, and opened a door for Janiſaries according to the Turkiſh phraſe, the Formality of which is in this manner: The Cheif Officer appointed for that purpoſe asks ſeverally ſuch as come to be liſted, Of what Chamber they deſire to be;<note place="margin">Formality in making Janiſaries in theſe days:</note> to which they making reply, That they will be of the fifth, ſixth, or ſeventh, or the like, the Officer gives them a blow under the ear with the palm of his hand, and bids them repair to their Chamber, with which they nimbly paſs away. But herein the due form and order of Janiſaries was corrupted; for in former days Janiſaries were educated in that condition from children, and from thence named <hi>Yeniſheri</hi> or <hi>Tyrones,</hi> or the young Souldiery; but now on this neceſſity of raiſing Forces, ancient men, Fathers of Families with long beards were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to the diſparagement of that Order, and corruption of the exactneſs of that Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Conſiderable Supplies alſo were ſent of Beldargees or Pioniers; ſo that this year from ſeveral parts, according to the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the Forces of <hi>Candia</hi> were recruited with a Supply of ſeventy thouſand men, for tranſportation of which and of their Proviſions, all Chriſtian Ships were imbarged at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ſeveral of which in their voyage to <hi>Candia,</hi> were intercepted by the Malteſe Corſaires, and particularly a French Ship called the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> on which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five hundred Turks, was taken, and in bording of her about an hundred Turks were killed upon the Deck: ſome other ſmall Veſſels (one of which was a Ligorneſe under Engliſh Colours) were taken the French Barks which had in this manner loſt their Corn, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedly returned to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> ſuppoſing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of having done their endeavours, and of being over-powered by a ſtronger Force was ſufficient: But the Turks who judge of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing well, but by the ſucceſs, having gotten them into their hands, made them not only return their Freight, but ſatisfie the loſs of the Cargaſon.</p>
                     <p>In the Month of <hi>March</hi> the Vizier having intelligence of ſix or ſeven Venetian Gallies to be at <hi>Fodile,</hi> not far from <hi>Standia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Fight at Sea.</note> under the Command of the Proveditor of the Armata <hi>Lorenco Cornaro,</hi> gave order to <hi>Regep</hi> Paſha of <hi>Romelia,</hi> who was Captain of the Souldiery, and <hi>Durach</hi> Begh, who commanded a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of twelve Gallies, to weigh Anchor in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:39539:102"/>the night, and there ſurpriſe them: <hi>Durach</hi> Begh, though ſore againſt his will, doubting the truth of the report, yet readily obeyed and fitted his Gallies for the Enterpriſe. The Captain-General having intelligence of the deſign, prepared four Gallies in Port, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked that night with a French Regiment and ſome Italians to the number of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, beſides two Companies of the Guards, and one of the Proveditor <hi>Nam,</hi> under the Command of Colonel <hi>Audré Facile</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alto,</hi> accompanied alſo with the Proveditor Extraordinary <hi>Daniel Juſtiniani,</hi> Commiſſary of the Treaſury of the Militia, with ſeveral other Captains and Officers; and arriving at <hi>Sandia,</hi> found the Proveditor General <hi>Cornaro</hi> newly entred there from cruſing the Seas with ſixteen Gallies, to whom having communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the deſign, they immediately looſed from the Port, and arrived at <hi>Fodilé</hi> before midnight. The Turks having from the place of their Anchorage diſcovered two Sail, hoped there might be no more, and therefore came forth to fight them; but ingaging farther, met ſuch a number as evidenced the danger, and the little hope there was in other than in their Courage and Arms. The night being dark, the Venetians not to miſtake each other, carried ſuch great Lights on their Maſt-heads, as not only diſtinguiſhed them from the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but alſo directed them to give battle to the Turks, which they proſecuted ſo home, that they took and ſunk five of the Turkiſh Gallies, of which the Admiral commanded by <hi>Durach</hi> Bey was one; the reſt, though much ſhattered, and for the preſent unſerviceable, did yet by the help of their Oars, and the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night, find a way to eſcape: nor was this Victory gained by the Venetians in a Fight of ſeven hours without the loſs of two hundred Souldiers killed, and about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred wounded, beſides ſome Perſons of Quality and Command, <hi>viz</hi> the Cavalier <hi>Araſi Juſtiniani,</hi> the Commiſſary <hi>Franceſco Cornaro, Foſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rini,</hi> &amp;c. the wounded were <hi>Georgio Greco, Lorenco Bembo,</hi> and <hi>Marco Balbi.</hi> The Turks loſt many of their beſt Sea-men and Souldiers, beſides Slaves and others, counting on every Galley one with another three hundred perſons; amongſt the Priſoners which amounted to four hundred and ten, the Beys of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Navarine</hi> with <hi>Muſtapha</hi> of <hi>Anatolia,</hi> and the Chiaus of the Paſha of <hi>Aleppo</hi> were taken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with eleven hundred Chriſtian Slaves who were all freed, on condition that they ſhould ſerve the Summer following in the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Armata. Of the Turks were ſlain <hi>Durach</hi> Bey, the Bey of <hi>Coron,</hi> and <hi>Haſtam</hi> formerly Bey of <hi>Coron.</hi> The Great Vizier from the Camp could all the time behold the flaſhes of the ſmall and great ſhot, and by help of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Lights perceive the ſucceſs of his own Fleet, not anſwerable to his expectation. What loſs the Turks ſuſtained with Slaves and Souldiers is incertain, only an hundred Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Slaves were releaſed, and four hundred Turks captivated, and amongſt the ſlain was <hi>Durach</hi> Bey himſelf, a ſtout Sea-man, and a known Pirate, who from a ſmall Brigantine had raiſed himſelf to be Begh of the <hi>Morea,</hi> and to command four or five Gallies of his own. In like manner, and not long after, a Squadron of Venetian Ships were forced by ſtorm in the night to anchor under Cape <hi>Spada,</hi> where accidentally ſix Turkiſh Gallies were riding. The Sky being very dark and cloſe, the firſt Ship ran foul of a Galley, and ſo ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and cruſhed her ſides, that being ready to ſink, the Turks forſook her, and run aboard the Ship to ſave a life which was to be afterwards miſerable and ſlaviſh. The others affrighted at the arrival of theſe unexpected gueſts, flipt their Cables to ſeek harbour in a tempeſtuous Sea; but the weather being too boiſterous for Gallies, one of them was caſt away, and about an hundred and ſeventy men loſt: the news hereof being brought to <hi>Venice</hi> by Colonel <hi>Vecthia</hi> with the Enſigns and Spoils taken from the Enemy, the Senate beſtowed the honour of Knighthood on the Captain-General, comforting the families of the ſlain and wounded with ſignal marks of Honour and Glory.</p>
                     <p>The Captain Paſha put this year to Sea more early than was uſual, deſigning to make as many Voyages to <hi>Candia</hi> as was poſſible, with Succours both of Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; his deſign and work was wholly to avoid the Venetians, and to ſteal aſhore his Recruits; to which end he made ſuch expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every Voyage,<note place="margin">The ſucceſs of the Turks at Sea.</note> that ſcarce could the Chriſtians have advice of his arrival in any part of the Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi> before he was well forwarded in his return: yet his haſte was not ſo great, but one time having fifty three Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in his Company, he adventured to look into the Port of <hi>Nio,</hi> where he met four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaires or Free-booters under Maſteſe Colours, commanded by two Brothers <hi>Themericort,</hi> and by the Knights <hi>Verva</hi> and <hi>Bremant:</hi> two of the Ships were on the Careen waſhing and tallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Veſſels, whilſt the other two, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Themericort</hi> Brothers were on the Guard, being at anchor in the narroweſt entrance to the Harbour. The Turks ſuppoſed at firſt, that ſo formidable an appearance of their Fleet would affright the Chriſtians to a Surrender, rather than to contend on thoſe unequal terms. But it ſeems the Corſaires were more reſolute than was imagined; for no ſooner did the Turks approach, than the Chriſtians diſcharged their Cannon and Vollies of ſmall ſhot ſo plentifully, as cauſed the Gallies to diſpute at a farther diſtance, where ſhooting as it were at rovers with their long Caſhee Pieces (not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturing to come to a nearer Fight) for the ſpace of eight hours made (as reported) about eight thouſand ſhot, with little or no execution; ſo that the Captain-Paſha made his ſign of Retreat, and forſook the Engagement, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too dangereous and difficult an Enterpriſe. But better ſucceſs had the Turks the next month at Sea againſt Captain <hi>Georgio,</hi> an old and ſubtle Pirate, who for many years had vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and pillaged, not only the Turks, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians on all Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago:</hi> great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune he had in taking Turkiſh Saiks and Veſſels; and ſome of them conſiderably rich, and when that prey failed him, or was ſcarce, he purſued his game on the ſhore, from whence he often carried men, women, and children into ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and oft-times had the fortune of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Booty. The Iſlands which lay open and ungarded were his common Rendezvous, where the men attended his ſervice, and the women his luſt. In this manner the Pirate paſſed for ſeveral years, have obtained unto himſelf a fame and terror with the Turks,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:39539:103"/>and riches at home: the place which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly choſe to waſh and tallow his Veſſels, was amongſt certain ſmall Iſles in the Bay of <hi>Edremit,</hi> anciently <hi>Adrimetum,</hi> oppoſite unto <hi>Mytilene,</hi> from whence he had as from a Thicket or Wood a view of ſuch Veſſels as paſſed the great Road towards <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> theſe frequent ſucceſſes rendred him ſo confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſecure, that he ſtill continued his ſtation, notwithſtanding the Turkiſh Naval Forces, which in the Summer ſeaſon made their Rendezvous at <hi>Scio.</hi> But at length the Captain-Paſha with the whole Turkiſh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata being at <hi>Scio,</hi> and with him three Ships of <hi>Tripoli,</hi> advice came that Captain <hi>Georgio</hi> had not forſaken his little Iſles, but was there careening his ſmall Fleet which conſiſted of two Ships and a Brigantine: hereupon the Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſes were commanded out to encounter the Enemy, whom the next day they found ſo ſecure and negligent, that he diſcovered not his Foes before they were ready to attaque him. The Captain Paſha alſo fearing that the Tripo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſes were not of ſufficient Force to encounter ſo valiant and experienced a Commander, both to make the Enterprize the more eaſie and certain, and to gain the reputation of that buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to himſelf, went out in perſon with all his Gallies. The Tripoleſes had began to fire on Captain <hi>Georgio</hi> before the Paſha came in to their aſſiſtance, but it falling calm, and the Ships not able to joyn in a nearer fight, gave way for the Gallies, which being above fifty in number, overpowered the Chriſtians on all ſides; howſoever, the two Ships defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt all this Force, until the Captain himſelf being killed, his own Ship ſurrendred, but ſo ſhattered, that ſhe was ſcarce able to ſwim above water.<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Georgio</hi> taken by the <hi>Turks.</hi>
                        </note> This Ship being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, the Turks boarded the other, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Captain <hi>de Leſcaſes,</hi> who ſeeing no remedy to avoid being taken, he leaped into his Boat, and blew up his Ship; howſoever could not eſcape his deſtiny, for having his Arm broke, he became a prey and a ſlave to his Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The News of this Victory was celebrated with ſo much the more joy, by how much this perſon was feared and hated, and was not only a ſubject of rejoycing to the Turks, but alſo to the Chriſtians, whoſe Parents and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Corſaire had pillaged and enſlaved; ſo that the Inhabitants of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> for the moſt part were pleaſed with the revenge, and promiſed more ſecurity and quietneſs to their open Coaſts. With no leſs triumph was this News poſted to the Grand Signior, who rewarded the Meſſenger with two thouſand Dollars gratuity, and cauſed demonſtrations of joy to be made through the whole Court; ſo dreadful was grown the Name of ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a perſon, in reſpect of the greatneſs of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                     <p>But the ſucceſs of this advantage did not heighten the courage of the Captain Paſha to that pitch, as to make him more bold with the Venetian Armata; for in the month of <hi>July</hi> having great Recruits of Men and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to land, and hearing that the Venetians lay before <hi>Canea,</hi> having fortified a Rock, called St. <hi>Todoro,</hi> at the mouth of that Port, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for <hi>Retimo;</hi> but purſuits, or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Enemies being in the way, or his own fears ſtill prevented him, until at length he was forced to <hi>Gira-Petra,</hi> a ſmall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure place, far diſtant from the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the way thither by land rocky, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unpaſſable for Beaſts of Burden; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Men and Ammunition were there landed with that haſte and expedition, that in leſs than thirty hours time the Captain Paſha was again upon his return for <hi>Scio,</hi> leaving the Souldiery, and the Ammunition he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked to find a paſſage through the Rocks and Mountains: At which the Vizier was ſo diſpleaſed, that he ſent the Captain Paſha this Meſſage, That the next time he ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to bring farther ſupplies, until he could find a more commodious Port wherein to land them.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the Marine Affairs paſſed this year at Sea, the Turkiſh Fleet having, beſides other ſuccours, tranſported <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> with eight hundred Spahees unto <hi>Candia,</hi> whom we mentioned formerly to have been Paſha of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and married to the Grand Signior's Siſter; and being one with whom I had a former acquaintance, and who was a great friend to the Engliſh Nation, I made him a viſit as he paſſed through <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilſt theſe matters were tranſacting at Sea, on the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> arrived the new Provedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor General <hi>Bernardo Nani,</hi> and Sergeant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Muteo Matei</hi> with five hundred Foot, ſent by the Pope, who gave Licence for deſtruction of ſome Monaſteries, whoſe Orders were judged leſs neceſſary in the Venetian State, that their Revenue might be applied to the ſervice of this War; after Arrival of which ſuccours, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Muſter was made of the whole Garriſon, and the number thereof reckoned to amount unto eight thouſand fighting Men; though ſoon afterwards continual action and exploits of War decimated the number, and many of the brave Commanders being taken off, every tenth man periſhed, and rendred the place in a condition which required continual ſupplies.</p>
                     <p>For many and various were the attempts and actions performed on both ſides under the Walls of <hi>Candia;</hi> and firſt the Turks began to make appear a Battery which they had raiſed on the ſide of the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> which ſo offended tho Port, that there was no harbour or acceſs for Veſſels. On the contrary to which, by the Fort of St. <hi>Andrea</hi> another Battery was raiſed, which offended <hi>Tramata</hi> very much, which was another ſmall harbour, capable only to receive Boats or Barks; the paſſage to which was ſo annoyed now by the Enemies Cannon, that no Veſſel could go in or out, unleſs in the Night, and that too with ſome difficulty and danger.</p>
                     <p>The Turks gaining advantage on the ſide of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Turks reſolve to make their paſſage by St <hi>Andrea.</hi>
                        </note> applied their whole ſtrength and diligence to that part; and one dark Night paſſing undiſcovered along the Seas, they ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed a Cord to the Paliſade of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and with an Engine ſtrained it ſo violently, that they tore away ſeveral of the main Stakes of the Work without being perceived by the Centinels, who paid for that neglect with the price of their lives; upon which ſucceſs they continued to advance their lines on that ſide, which Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> perceiving, reſolved to hinder by ſome valiant ſallies. And firſt two hundred brave men ſelected out of ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:39539:103"/>conducted by Sergeant Major <hi>Motta,</hi> iſſued out from <hi>Panigra,</hi> and taking their way along the Sea, bravely mixed with the Turks, and put them to flight;<note place="margin">A Sally made by the Chriſtians.</note> and though the Alarm thereof brought a Concourſe of Turks from all parts of the Camp, yet the Chriſtians ſtood ſo ſtoutly to it, that they ſtruck a terror to their Enemies, and once forced them to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat within their Trenches; and at length, after they had overthrown certain Redoubts and Traverſes, they gave back with good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, returning with Victory and Glory; which bravery the Captain General-acknowledged to all, and encouraged in the common Souldiery with a Preſent of fifty Zechins. This ſucceſs gave the beſieged opportunity to finiſh their Platforms which they had raiſed on the ſide of the Ditch adjoining to the Bulwark of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> on which they planted two pieces of Cannon which carried fifty pound Bullet a piece; which much diſturbed the Enemies Traverſes: Howſoever, the Turks with indefatigable pains, and invincible patience battered the little Tower of <hi>Priuli,</hi> the Curtain, and Revelin of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and employed all their power and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to fill the Ditch with Faggots, Earth and other Rubbiſh.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> after the Chriſtians had firſt made a Breach on the Enemies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, which confronted the Revelin of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and ſprang five Mines one after the other, a ſecond Sally was made by a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Body of the beſieged, conſiſting of two hundred French and Savoyards, three hundred Italians, two hundred Germans, and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty horſemen,<note place="margin">Another Sally.</note> who iſſued forth with that Gallantry, that driving the Turks under Covert, advanced far within their Works, with which Demonſtration of honour the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General being ſatisfied, they made the ſmoke which was a Signal for their Retreat; ſo that returning victorious without much loſs, that day was remarkable, and numbred amongſt the other days which were eſteemed ſucceſsful and fortunate in that Siege.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever, the Turks with admirable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and aſſiduity crept forward by their Traverſes, and help of their great ſhot on the Baſtion of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which whilſt <hi>Auguſtine Roſtayne,</hi> Adjutant of Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, he was taken off by a Cannon Bullet, and yet the Turks could not advance ſo faſt, but that the Engineer <hi>Maupaſſan</hi> gave ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardment to their progreſs by firing a Mine, which overthrew two of their Redoubts, and afforded them new work to repair them and the adjoining Traverſes.</p>
                     <p>This was the preſent ſtate of the miſerable <hi>Candia,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> recalled his Subject Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> from his honourable employment;<note place="margin">Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into <hi>Italy.</hi>

                     <p>I cannot adventure to aſſign the reaſons that might induce the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to recal the worthy Governour from this glorious action. Some ſay, that thoſe who were emulous of his glory procured his revocation; Others, that the Marqueſs himſelf deſired it;<note place="margin">Cauſes of Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</note> and that finding the Forces of the Town to decline, and the Turks to encroach and penetrate daily into the innermoſt parts of ſtrength, he was deſirous, after ſo long a Siege, to return with untainted glory; or perhaps weary of a Siege ſo tedious and perilous, he might deſire to retire, having performed ſufficient already in his own perſon, and enough to make all Chriſtendom his Debtors and Admirers. So that I cannot but reproach thoſe tongues and pens, which in report and writings attribute the cauſe of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Villa</hi>'s retirement to certain juſt occaſions of diſcontent given him by the Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Franceſco Moroſini,</hi> who, envious of his Fame and actions, and unwilling to have a conſhater with him in his honours, did uſually thwart his Counſels and Propoſals; and more particularly contemned a Redoubt which Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>Villa</hi> had built, and of which he had a ſingular eſteem. Yet that <hi>Moroſini</hi> might evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the unſufficiency thereof, 'tis reported that he wrote a Letter to the Vizier, to aſſault that Redoubt; for if he did, he promiſed to afford him opportunity to take it, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing all Forces from thence; which Letter it is ſaid, was betrayed to Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> and brought to his hands, which he with great pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and moderation diſſembled until the hour of his departure, and then produced it to the aſtoniſhment and ſhame of <hi>Moroſini.</hi> To this particular I give the leſs belief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find it wrote in a Journal of this Seige by a perſon who was a great Favourer of the French, and willing to ſhare the intire glory to that Nation, and the miſcarriages to the Italian. Whatſoever might be the motive to Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> to perſwade his return, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; howſoever, it is reported, that being arrived at <hi>Zant</hi> in his way to <hi>Venice;</hi> and there meeting a ſtrong Convoy bound for <hi>Candia,</hi> with recruits of Men, and plenty of proviſions, he conceived new thoughts of the greatneſs of the Republick; and beholding alſo with what vigour and vigilance they attended to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of that place, he began to teſtifie ſome remorſe and diſſatisfaction for having abandoned a Charge which rendred his Fame great through the World; and the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which labours being crowned with that ſucceſs which his courage and conduct merited, might have brought a Bleſſing to all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and perpetuated his honour and glory to all poſterity.

                     <p>The Senate, that they might teſtifie the eſteem they entertained of the perſon of Marqueſs <hi>Villa,</hi> preſented him with a Baſon of Gold valued at ſix thouſand Ducats, together with a Patent recounting at large the many famous Exploits which he had performed in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, which they expreſſed with a ſtile ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and obliging, as may ſerve for a Record to tranſmit the Fame of his Merits to all Poſterity.</p>
                     <p>Marqueſs <hi>Villa</hi> being departed from <hi>Candia,</hi> the Captain-General recalled all his Forces from divers parts of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which he had ſent thither with the Soldiers wounded in the laſt Battle; and being returned, they brought with them great numbers of Pioniers and Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to labour in the Fortifications and Mines: at the ſame time alſo the Captain-Paſha arrived at <hi>Canea,</hi> bringing two thouſand Janiſaries with him.</p>

And therefore in the firſt place having viſited all the Forts, Out-works, and Retrenchments of the Town, ordered what was neceſſary for repair of the breaches, and amended what was deficient in the moſt diſtreſſed Fortifications. And though the Turks fired a Mine the <hi>22th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> at the point of the Fort St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which made a moſt dangerous breach; yet it was ſo valiantly defended, and ſo ſpeedily repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Enemy gained little or no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and all by the extraordinary diligence of this Marqueſs St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> who paſſed whole months without uncloathing himſelf; and as his nights were without ſleep, ſo his days con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed without repoſe, applying himſelf perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to all places where was moſt of danger, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at the Fort of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> where he took up his conſtant Quarters.</p>

                     <p>And now the time of year approaching, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town expected its ultimate Relief, and the Union of all the Princes of Chriſtendom for raiſing the Siege, which had continued for the ſpace now of about two years; the valiant Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians full of hopes, daily animated each other, caſting their eyes to Sea-ward, promiſed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the firſt Deſcryer of the long deſired Fleet. The Turks alſo being adviſed of the expected Succours, reſolved if poſſible to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the buſineſs deſigned before their arrival; and thereupon made one of the greateſt aſſaults that ever was yet given to the Town, in which though the Chriſtians behaved themſelves with all valour imaginable, yet the Turks ſtill gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther footing and advantage. And now it fared with the Town after every ſtorm, as it doth with a phyſical body after every acceſſion of a Feaver, which though it intermits for ſome time, yet it leaves the Patient always more weak and debilitated than before. Wherefore the Chriſtians increaſing in care and diligence, the Captain-General diſarmed ſeveral of his Gallies to ſupply the Town with what Force he could poſſibly contribute, and the Engineers imployed their brains for deſtruction of the Enemy, ſo that they fell again to their Mines, and ſprang one which took good effect; ſoon after they ſprang ſeven others, after which four more near the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi>

                        <p>But that which was reported by the moſt ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious concerning theſe Ships, was, That his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty being made to underſtand perfectly the affronts put on his Nation by the Turks; and not fully ſatisfied (as is ſuppoſed) with the reſpect they had ſhown to his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> made it the chief Deſign of his Ships to withdraw him from thence, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it a leſs diminution to his honour, to have the perſon of his Agent ſubjected to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts, than of his Ambaſſador, to which (it was imagined) he might be obnoxious, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of thoſe great ſupplies, which were in the following year deſigned for <hi>Candia.</hi> In what manner ſoever the Turks deemed of this appearance of Men of War to hector and brave them at their Imperial City, they did yet for the preſent cunningly diſſemble the matter, giving the <hi>French</hi> fair Words, and what plenty of Proviſions their oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions did require. In what manner this Affair was tranſacted, I ſhall not adventure to relate, nor is it well or certainly known; Yet not long after came Orders for the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to repair to the Court at <hi>Lariſſa;</hi> and that until the Grand Signior's pleaſure was far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known, the Ships of War were to be detained. The Commander in chief, called Monſieur <hi>d' Almeras,</hi> was not a little troubled to have his Ships thus embargued, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his thoughts between the time limited in his Inſtructions by his Maſter and the reſtraint by the Turks, he once bravely reſolved to hazard his paſſage through the Caſtles, but protracting the execution thereof from day to day, even until the end of <hi>April;</hi> at length Licence came for their departure, and Orders to repair unto <hi>Vola,</hi> near <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> there to take an Ambaſſador, or Agent, or Envoyé from the Sultan to their King. For it ſeems, the Vizier had intimated to the Grand Signior, That it was not time to diſguſt the French King, and to bring him under the notion of a declared and publick Enemy, or at leaſt to irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him ſo far as might provoke him to ſend greater Forces, than perhaps he deſigned the next year, for <hi>Candia:</hi> and that he ought to comply with the preſent conjuncture, and ſalve that up for a time, which he might afterwards open at his pleaſure.<note place="margin">The Grand Signior ſends a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to the French King.</note> This counſel ſeeming reaſonable to the Grand Signior, and agreeable to the preſent neceſſity, he ordered (as I was credibly informed) a thouſand Dollars only to adorn his Ambaſſador; ſo pitifully do the Turks eſteem of Chriſtian Princes, and ſo highly do they value themſelves, as if a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from them would be reverenced in Chriſtendom as a favour, though brought by a Porter or a Slave. But the French Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:39539:106"/>conſidering this allowance too mean a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for a perſon qualified to appear before his Maſter, did (as it is ſaid) out of his own Purſe and generous Soul contribute a far greater Sum, with two Veſts of Sables towards his better Equipage. In this manner the Sultan diſſembling an appearance of good correſpondence with his Chriſtian Majeſty, diſpatched away his Envoyé on the Ships of War, being a Perſon in quality of a <hi>Mutafaraca,</hi> one of the ſame degree with a Chaous, to expoſtulate with the King concerning ſeveral Particulars, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially his Reaſons for ſending for his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, without ſending another according to ancient cuſtom to ſupply his Office, wondering much at this ſudden alteration of friendſhip, without any cauſe given on the Ottoman ſide: and with theſe ſmooth and fair words the Turks imagined they might charm the Spirit of the King for a while, and ſuſpend his Succours from <hi>Candia,</hi> until at laſt it were beyond his power and wiſdom to relieve. In the mean time the Ambaſſador from the moſt Chriſtian King was detained as an Hoſtage for the other, of whoſe return we ſhall ſpeak in its due place.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of this year Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey</hi> Lord Ambaſſador from His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Betlem, Panigra,</hi> St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and <hi>Sabionera.</hi> Theſe places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice ſtormed, in which the Turks loſt thirty thouſand men, ſo many Mines and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelli were fired, that the ground lay open like a vaſt abyſs, with ſtrange heaps of confuſed and undigeſted Earth, and hindred the Enemy from approaching to the Wall; but <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea</hi> being eſteemed the moſt weak, becauſe they were not fortified by any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Out-works, or compaſſed with any depth of Ditch, were preſſed and forced upon by the Turk with more violence than any parts of the City. The Enemy having by their great number of Pioniers elevated the confuſed Earth, they formed ſome Batteries, fortifying them and ſheltering their people with Sacks of Wool, and a Labyrinth (as we may ſay) of Redoubts, they advanced foot by foot upon the Revelin of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> being deſtitute of all Mines to ſtop their proceedings; and having at length blown up the Revelin, and with fire, and earth having taken the Out-work, they penetrated into the Ditch (which was not deep) with four Traverſes, and came now to the very foot of the wall of the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, fortified with eighteen pieces of Cannon, ſix of which carrying fifty pound Bullet ſhot into the Ditch, eight flanked that ſide which was oppoſite to <hi>Panigra,</hi> and four on that part towards the Revelin of St. <hi>Spirito,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which they ſtormed the Walls in nine places. And beginning to make a breach by firing certain Mines, which opened a wideneſs of forty two paces at the point of that Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark; and continuing their breaches towards the Sea, breaking in their way the Front of the Fort <hi>Priulo,</hi> they proceeded almoſt to the Gate of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and opened forty eight paces more, in all ninety paces. Afterwards they ruined the remainder of the Wall, and that which was called the Scotch Fort to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sea; ſo that the Chriſtians were forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from their Out-works, and contract their Precincts to the Walls of the City.</p>
                        <p>To add unto the miſery of this place, an unfortunate ſhot from the Turks Camp entred that Magazine which was near St. <hi>Peter;</hi> Church, where the artificial Fires were made; and meeting ſeveral ſhells of Granadoes already charged, with thirty Barrels of Powder; all took fire and blew into the air, and burned all the houſes which were near thereunto. At this unlucky accident the Beſieged fearing a general aſſault, and ſeeing the Turkiſh Horſe draw into a Body near <hi>Sabionera,</hi> the whole Garriſon ran to the Walls; but no farther Attempt being made, towards evening they blew up a Lodge of the Enemy, with all the people that were therein.</p>

                     <p>TOwards the end of the laſt Year, and at the beginning of this the Turks began to open their eyes, and find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded with the groſſeſt cheat that ever was impoſed on a people who had either reaſon or humanity. For now three or four years had ran on, that the French, Dutch, Italians, and other Nations had introduced into all parts of the Turkiſh Dominions (unleſs in thoſe Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as <hi>Aleppo,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The ſtory of the falſe Reaux or Temins.</note> and farther) a ſort of ſmall Mony called by ſome <hi>Luigini,</hi> by others <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavi,</hi> and by the Turks <hi>Temins,</hi> worth about five pence Engliſh; which appearing pleaſant and bright to the eye, and commodious for change, and common expences, ſo bewitched the Commonalty, that Pieces of Eight, Zai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, and other merchantable Money were laid aſide, as neither currant or valuable. At firſt about nine years paſt they were of good and warrantable Silver, but afterwards with time by little and little grew worſe and of baſer alloy: at length the people doting more and more upon them, they came coarſer every day than other; and being ſtill currantly paſſable, every perſon that was failed, and of bad reputation entred into the Trade, who knowing no bounds of honeſty or of gain, compoſed their Mony wholly of Copper or coarſer Metals, with a fair gloſs and reſemblance of Silver, buying therewith the Commodities of the Country; and at length amaſſed up all the Gold, Silver, and whatſoever came to hand was the price of their falſe and baſtard Coin, with which they filled and abuſed all <hi>Aſia:</hi> nor was this Money only of one Mint, but of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Stamps and Mottoes reproachful to the Turks, and it is pity they had not wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to underſtand them, as namely, <hi>Voluit hanc Aſia mercem. De procul pretiam ejus,</hi> and ſuch like; which were ſo various, that many who had the curioſity to make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of them, found no leſs than an hundred and twenty ſeveral Stamps. The Commonalty ſtill enamoured with the brightneſs of their colour, and commodiouſneſs of their change, little reflected on the ill conſequence to the generality, having ſeldom more than to ſupply
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:39539:107"/>their daily wants. And the Officers of the the Cuſtoms finding a benefit extraordinary to themſelves upon the vaſt Sums of Money im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, little cared how it fared with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. In the mean time the whole currant of Merchandiſe in the Levant was diſpoſſeſſed of its ordinary and true chanel; for vaſt quantities or a glut of Turkiſh Goods filled all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the prices low and cheap, and no profit to any Merchant dealing upon the ſquare, or upon the old and legal way of Traffick. At <hi>Ligorne</hi> and other parts of <hi>Italy</hi> complaints were made, That the Silver and Bullion of the Country were melted down to make a compoſition with baſer Metals for <hi>Turkie,</hi> and exchanged for decaying and periſhable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. In ſhort, no man ſeemed ſatisfied with the Trade, and yet the World, like their ſins, which they diſapprove, purſued it with all heat and violence imaginable. This Trade being thus over-laid, and vaſt heaps of adulterate Mony imported daily worſe and worſe, cauſed the Jews and other Merchants at firſt to except againſt ſome forts, and admit of others. This ſcruple, together with the prohibition of them two years before by the Engliſh Factory at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> obliging themſelves unto the Levant Company under a conſiderable penalty not to receive this mony for Cloth or other Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the growth of <hi>England,</hi> together with the circumſpection and contrivance of the Engliſh Conſul, awakened firſt the blind minds of the Turks, who having long been infatuated with this beloved mony, began now to reject and abhor it like the falſe and farded countenance of a Courtiſan: ſo that from eleven they fell to twelve, and ſo to thirteen and fourteen to the Lion-Dollars. In which conjuncture a Dutch Convoy arrived at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> importing vaſt Sums thereof; which for a Bribe to the Officers of the City, or what the Cuſtomer would ask, were permitted Licence to be landed; which overflowing in great abundance, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a worſe than better alloy, went decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to eighteen, and ſo to twenty, at which Rate for a ſhort time they paſſed currant. And now at this price the Officers did what was poſſible to keep them up, conceiving it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, in a time of ſo much ſcarcity of all ſorts of other Coins, that the Countries could ſubſiſt, or that Trade in buying or ſelling could proceed, if this mony ſhould wholly loſe its eſteem and value: nor were the people ſo much the care of the Governours, though for many years they had known no other price or reward of their labours, as were the vaſt damages of the Sultan, in whoſe Coffers were conſiderable Sums, which were never known to have been pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto the loſs of the Exchequer; for it is a Proverb amongſt the Turks, <hi>That the Grand Signiors Lead cannot ſink.</hi> But that which raiſed moſt of tumult was the rigour of the Tax-gatherers, who refuſed to take that mony from the people for their Duties to the Grand Signior, but demanded of them Lion-Dollars, <hi>Sevil</hi> and <hi>Mexico</hi> Pieces of Eight, or the like; which they not being able to find, beat and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned them in all places, where this queſtion came into diſpute: the people hereupon, though patient, and accuſtomed to violence and burden, could not yet ſupport longer an oppreſſion ſo unreaſonable, but that Inſurrection was made in all places where this came into diſpute: and as injured patience turns to fury, at <hi>Pruſa</hi> and <hi>Angora</hi> the torrent of the peoples rage was not appeaſed without the blood and lives of ſome of their Officers, alledging with good reaſon, That their Miniſters and Governors having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced or permitted this mony amongſt them, and allowed it as currant in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as that they had for ſome years known no other, nor received other for all the fruits of their labour or poſſeſſions, they ought not now to refuſe to receive that which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had made paſſable: which argument and reaſon was preſſed in ſundry places with that violence, that the Officers were forced to ſubmit to the neceſſity of the times, and the fury of the multitude. And now this mony had wholly loſt its reputation, and began to be refuſed generally at any rate whatſoever; ſo that though the Government thought fit to licenſe them at thirty to the Dollar; yet the people proſecuting the abaſement of it with a hate and diſaffection equal to their former deſires, refuſed generally and abſolutely to accept them in payment. Wherefore the Sultan perceiving that the power of his Officers was not ſufficient to render this mony longer paſſable at any rate, at length he commanded, that every one ſhould bring in his mony of theſe ſorts into the Mint where it ſhould be melted down, and the Silver it produced ſhould be delivered to the Proprietor. At which Summons ſeveral Great men voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought in their mony, others had it ſeized and condemned to the Furnace, amongſt which was a French Merchant ingaged to the import of ſixty thouſand Dollars. As yet the News of this alteration not having reached Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, divers-Ships arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with vaſt Sums of this mony, which were all ſeized and forced to the Mint. In like manner other Ships arrived at <hi>Smyrna</hi> with the ſame Commodity, which my ſelf would not ſuffer to be landed, and ſome of them having no other foundation of Stock or Freight, returned empty, to the great loſs of the Employers. It was ſtrange to ſee, how on a ſudden all Trade ceaſed, no mony being left in the Country, few Bargains were made but by Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and though all this ruine might wholly be attributed to the ill Government, yet the people were contented, and ſate down with the loſs. And thus concluded this extravagant Trade of falſe Mony, being ſuppoſed to have wrought more of deſtruction and loſs at the end, than it brought of benefit at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; memorable for nothing more than for expiring ſo quietly, though it had the chief part of the Turkiſh Empire to ſupport and defend it.</p>
                     <p>During theſe Troubles the Grand Signior paſſed his time in hunting near <hi>Lariſſa,</hi> where he ruined the Country round about, and tired the people with beating and driving the Woods for Game and wild Beaſts to divertiſe him, in which, as formerly, he continued ſo exceſſively immoderate, that without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the heats, or colds, or moiſture of the ſeaſon, he compelled the people, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Jews (of which great numbers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit that Country) to continual labours in the Woods and Fields; by which many died through the rigid Froſts of the Winter and Calentures of the Summer. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe Divertiſements, the Grand Signior could not eaſily caſt off the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:39539:107"/>apprehenſions and fears he had for the ſtate of his Affairs, imagining that the long delays and ill ſucceſs at <hi>Candia,</hi> and defaults in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had begotten in his Subjects a hate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Perſon, and a deſire of alteration. Wherefore the Spring approaching, he retired into a ſolitary but pleaſant ſhade amongſt the Mountains, where ſprang cool and cryſtalline waters, about ſixteen hours Journey from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa.</hi> In this ſolitude his melancholy thoughts again diſquieted him with a jealouſie and ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">The Grand Signior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to cut off his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> leſt his Brothers now at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould take their advantage, and one of them be by the Peoples conſent and aſſiſtance placed in his Imperial Seat: which imagination made that impreſſion in him, that he immediately diſpatched away a truſty and valiant Officer with all ſecrecy, without making any noiſe, to bring him their Heads, directing his Commands to his Mother, in whoſe cuſtody they were; not doubting of her help and aſſent, as being moſt nearly concerned in his intereſt, expected every hour the return of his Meſſenger with that grateful Preſent, which could only cure the torture of his jealouſie, and alleviate his cares. But no ſooner was this fatal Command arrived at the hands of the Queen, but ſhe trembled ſo much, that ſhe could ſcarce hold the Paper. At length conſidering, that (as hath been ſaid before) ſhe had given in caution to the Janiſaries for the lives of theſe Princes, and that to her care they were committed ſhe immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed and publiſhed the deſign of the Grand Signior to the Janiſar-Aga, craving his help and protection, proteſting that ſhe was reſolved to maintain the faith ſhe had given to thoſe Princes, whoſe life ſhe tendered equal with her own. This advice and reſolution of the Queen-Mother being brought to the Janiſaries, was heartily approved, and proteſtations, given that they would never abandon her, nor the lives ſhe preſerved. The rumour hereof in an inſtant flew through the ſtreets; but with ſuch variety of reports, that nothing of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty was known, only in general ſome great ruine was apprehended to threaten the City; whereupon a ſtrange outcry was made to ſhut up the ſhops, and every one to conſult the ſafety of the Publick. But ſome few hours after, it being more diſtinctly known, that the Grand Signior had ſent for the Heads of his Brothers; the People of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe ſole hopes of ſeeing the Royal City reſtored to its ancient Honour, was by the conſervation of theſe Princes, were in a greater combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than before; for every one then betook himſelf to his Arms: ſo that in a ſhort time were aſſembled forty thouſand men at <hi>Okmedon</hi> well appointed, where confiding in the ſtrength of a general Cauſe, in which they were ingaged, they vented many opprobrious ſpeeches againſt the Government, calling the Chief Miniſters <hi>Orſyſler,</hi> which is unfortunate Fellows, a term amongſt the Turks, of the greateſt ignominy, eſpecially to a Governor, and loudly exclaimed and wiſhed for a reformation. In the mean time the Queen-Mother deſired aid from the Janiſaries, and Guards about the Apartments of the Princes, leſt the Boſtangees, who are the Creatures of the Grand Signior, ſhould aſſault their Quarters. The Conſultations alſo amongſt the Janiſaries were long and ſecret, and the Queen-Mother diſpatched ſeveral Meſſages to the Grand Signior, adviſing him to forſake the Mountains, and repair to one of his Imperial Cities, as became the Majeſty of ſo great a Sultan, being the only means to ſecure to him the eſtabliſhment of his Crown. And now the Reader will with impatience at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the concluſion and iſſue of ſo great ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and diſturbances; but it is now, as it hath been experienced in other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,<note place="margin">Tac.

And ſo was the effect of theſe receſſes, and mutiny of the people at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe humour of novelty and change venting it ſelf, and in four or five days tired with expectation; at length every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to return to his dwelling and employment. The face likewiſe of things at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſeemed quiet and appeaſed, carrying with it, as it were, a ſtill modeſty and ſhame for the late diſorders; and nothing was heard or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured for the ſpace of twenty or thirty days after, until the Grand Signior trembling with the fears of this confuſed Rebellion, kept more ſtrict Guards than ordinary within his moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and after being better recollected, entered into Conſultation, and being adviſed of the Heads and Leaders of the late Inſurrection, proſcribed ſuch as were the prime Actors, and having diſpatched away two or three Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers on this Errant, they entered ſecretly in the Night to their Lodgings, where they quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without noiſe, took off the heads of four or five of them, and baniſhed as many without the leaſt noiſe, or notice taken thereof by the Vulgar. And becauſe this diſorder happened at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> for which the chief Commander ought to anſwer, the Chimacam paſſed not without a jealouſie either of negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or conſent; wherefore the Vizier ſent for him and the Janiſar-Aga to <hi>Candia,</hi> as if he had occaſion of their ſervice, though not without their own fears and ſuſpicion of others, to anſwer and make ſatisfaction for the late mutiny. And thus for a while this Flame is extinguiſhed, and the fire raked up in the Embers. We muſt expect a while and obſerve when and where it will again burſt forth.</p>

Notwithſtanding which the Turks preſſed ſo conſtantly and boldly forward, that though the Chriſtians were ſtrong within, and provided with all ſorts of proviſions both of war and ſuſtenance, yet nothing ſupported their Courages and Spirits more than the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of promiſed Succours from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> it being reported, and generally believed, that they would be ſo numerous as might be able to give Battel in the Field unto the Turk, and force them out of their Trenches; for by no other means was it poſſible for this City to be relieved: for it might fare with this place, as it did formerly with <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which, though wanting neither men nor proviſions, were yet taken by palms and inches of ground, till not ſo much was left, as would hold men to defend them. A pregnant example (as Sr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple</hi> well obſerves) how impoſſible it is to defend any Town that cannot be relieved by an Army ſtrong enough to raiſe the Siege. Whilſt the Chriſtians were entertained with theſe hopes, the Turks fortified themſelves without as ſtrongly as the beſieged had within, heaving like Moles with their numerous Army of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, whoſe lives being not valued, they were wholly intent unto Mines, blowing up all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, in that manner that every day they gained a pace of ground within the City. So that in effect (as will be ſeen by the Sequel) this moſt impregnable Fort of the World was forced and taken by the Spade and Shovel, and by a Crew of unarmed Labourers, who underſtood nothing more than the Plough and Harrow. So that now this Town ſeemed to be reduced to its utmoſt Criſis, either of being taken, or for ever freed of this malignant Enemy. And indeed the Turks had ſo far advanced upon the Bulwark of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> that now nothing remained of it, more than ruines, and undigeſted heaps of Earth and ſtone, in defence of which the chief Commanders applying themſelves in perſon with all diligence, the Marqueſs St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Montbrun</hi> was wounded by a ſtone in the face, the Cavalier <hi>de Bret</hi> was buried in the ruines to the very Neck, and with difficulty drawn out of the Earth by Aſſiſtants about him; two other Cavaliers were wounded with Granadoes, and the Cavalier <hi>Fuillere,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Standard of <hi>Malta,</hi> was ſhot into the Eye with a Musket. The Proveditor General <hi>Carnaro</hi> ſerving at the repair of the Breach, was ſo wounded in the Belly by a Granado, that his Bowels burſt, of which he died in three hours; and with a piece of the ſame Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado the Count <hi>Vignole,</hi> a French Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of great Valour, was likewiſe ſlain: And ſo hotly the Turks plyed this Breach, that from the <hi>28th.</hi> of <hi>May</hi> to the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>June</hi> they ſprang five Mines, which brake all the Paliſades of the Chriſtians; the which the Turks ſeconded with that fury and mettle, as if they intended to win the place and make an end of their work, before the arrival of the Forces expected from Chriſtendom. And this Poſt was now grown ſo dangerous and weak, that the Captain-General, the Marqueſs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi> and all the chief Officers took up their Quarters at this place, where his Excellency kept an open Table, and the Marqueſs took up his Lodgings at Night, that ſo the other Officers might have no excuſe on account of attendances or orders to abandon theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
                     <p>The Princes of Chriſtendom all this time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got not their beſieged Brethren in <hi>Candia.</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the IX. preſſed the moſt Chriſtian King to make ready his ſuccours in due time,<note place="margin">Succours ſent out of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> who had already himſelf prepared all things, and elected the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> his General of all the Forces by Sea, whether of French or other Nations. This Duke, like a couragious and brave Prince, thinking it little glory to command at Sea, where the Enemy was of an inferiour and unable Force to encounter him, did therefore deſire Licence from his King to make tryal of his Fortune in the Field, where he might evidence his Valour in the face of the Infidels, and ſignalize his Fame either by Death or Victory. The King, unwilling to hazard ſo worthy a perſon of his bloud out of his due Command in the rank of an ordinary Souldier, at firſt denied his requeſts; but the Pope interceding for him, whoſe General he was, with holy Arguments, and devout Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations of Martyrdom, and glory of dying for the Chriſtian Cauſe, at length obtained a conceſſion from the King, who of himſelf was flexible to ſo pious a requeſt, eſteeming it unholy to deprive his Kinſman either of the Palm of a Martyr, or the Lawrel of a Conqueror.</p>
                     <p>The Summer being come, and all things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,<note place="margin">The French Fleet looſe from <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
                        </note> the Duke aſcended his Ship at <hi>Tolon</hi> a City in <hi>Provence,</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>June, New-ſtyle,</hi> with about ſeven thouſand Land Souldiers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> with the Marſhals <hi>Lebret</hi> and <hi>Colbert,</hi> and ſeveral other Worthies and Heroes of undaunted Courage, and arrived before the Town of <hi>Candia</hi> the <hi>19th.</hi> of the ſame Month, having caſually encountred together in the Seas on the <hi>17th.</hi> with fourteen Sail of Venetian Ships, laden with Horſe and Ammunition to mount the Troops, and relieve the Town: which happy encounter and ſpeedy paſſage, ſeemed a happy Omen of the future ſucceſs. The appearance of this ſuccour ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Beſieged as ſent from Heaven, and adminiſtred unto them new hopes and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and the ſalutes paſſed between the Town and the Fleet with the uſual Ceremonies, and all the imaginable teſtimonies of joy and triumph.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner were they arrived than the two Generals, with other principal Officers,<note place="margin">They ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in their Shallops took the beſt view and ſurvey they could of the Enemies Camp, and the Condition of the Beſieged; in which whilſt they entertained themſelves, they eſpied a ſmall Veſſel making towards them with St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Colours, in which was the famous Engineer Signior <hi>Caſtellano,</hi> diſpatched by the Captain General <hi>Moroſini</hi> with an axact plat of the Town, and diſpoſition of the Turkiſh Camp, which being particularly viewed and conſidered, it was evident, That if the Turks ſhould make ſome very forcible Attempt before the new For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could be landed (as it was very probable they might) they would put all in hazard of being loſt; wherefore the Captain General preſſed to have ſome ſuccours immediately ſupplied to be aſſiſtant in that caſe of extremity; To which the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> immediately conſented, and landed himſelf that Night in perſon with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Force to mount the Guard on the Breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> whoſe firſt Rettenchment was continually battered by the Turks; and though there was a ſecond Retrenchment in hand, yet time being required for compleating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that part of the Town would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:39539:108"/>to its ultimate hazard; for ſhould the Enemy ſpring a Mine (which they feared was already formed under the preſent Work) it would lay all open and naked, without other Fortification. The Duke being aſhoar, was received by <hi>Moroſini</hi> with all demonſtrations of Civility and Reſpect due to a perſonage of his Quality and Employment; and with a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuitable to the preſent extremity of his Affairs: all Ceremonies and Complements were ſoon paſſed over, the urgency of matters not permitting them time to be long imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent;<note place="margin">The French Forces landed.</note> ſo that falling into the Diſcourſe of the common ſafety, it was reſolved that the ſuccours ſhould be immediately landed, which was performed with that diligence and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, that in two days the whole Army came ſafe on ſhore, excepting only ſome few, cut ſhort by ſhot from the Enemies Camp.</p>
                     <p>On the 23d. the Generals and other Officers, held a Council of War,<note place="margin">A Council of War held in <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> amongſt whom was alſo the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> and did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly conclude, that the Town was no longer tenable, or to be maintained unleſs by ſome extraordinary enterprize attempted on the Enemy, and by ſome furious Sally per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with reſolution, and ſtratagems of War, in order unto which it was reſolved, That the <hi>27th.</hi> ſhould be the day of ſally both with Horſe and Foot, and that the Fleet not to loſe their part in this action, ſhould play with their great Guns on that ſide of the Turkiſh-Army which lay incamped on the Quarters of St. <hi>Andrea.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The order of the Chriſtian Army to make their Sally.</note> All the Forces were landed on the <hi>26th.</hi> and the whole night fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing was ſpent in preparations for the next days ſally: the Army being drawn up made four Batalions, the firſt called the Admirals commanded by the Sieurs <hi>Martel, Vandre,</hi> and <hi>Gravier;</hi> the ſecond was the Vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals commanded by the Sieurs <hi>de la Monthe</hi> and <hi>Planta;</hi> the third was the Rere-Admirals under Command of Chevalier <hi>de Bouillion, Garbaret,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>Dailly;</hi> the fourth was the Batalion of the Sieur <hi>d' Almeras</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded under him by the Sieurs <hi>Panetier, de la Rogue, Fontier, Bitault,</hi> and the Chevalier <hi>de Nemond;</hi> and on the left hand of theſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Batalions, the Guards of the Duke of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> were diſpoſed. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be a Spectator in this glorious Action, without bearing a part in his own perſon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had given order to the Fleet to accoſt the ſhore on the ſide of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> as near as conſiſted with their ſecurity, and from thence with their great Guns to annoy the Enemies Camp as much as was poſſible, came that night on ſhore, reſolving to fight in the Head of the Forlorn Hope, from which hazardous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture no intreaties or counſel of his friends could prevail to diſſwade him.</p>
                     <p>The Forlorn conſiſted of 400 men, on the head of which marched fifty men with hand Granadoes, flanked with three Troops of Horſe, Commanded by Count <hi>Dampire:</hi> the Regiments of Guards, with four Troops of Horſe for their Wings, flanked alſo with three Regiments of Foot, followed the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn. The Reſerve conſiſted of the Regiments of <hi>Harcourt, Conti, Lignieres, Roſan, Montpeſat,</hi> and <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> flanked with four Troops of Horſe under Command of the Count <hi>Choiſeul,</hi> which placed themſelves on a riſing ground, to hinder all Communication between the Vizier, whoſe Camp was before St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and the Janizar Aga, who lay before <hi>Sabionera.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the firſt and ſecond line, were placed fifty Musketiers of the King, to be aſſiſtant on occaſion; and the other Troops of Horſe were to take the left hand along the Trench leading to the <hi>Sabionera:</hi> the Regiment of <hi>Montpeyroux</hi> was to mount the Guard on the Fort of St. <hi>Demetrius</hi> to ſecure the Retreat, if occaſion ſhould require. In like manner five hundred Pioniers were ordered to level the Trenches of the Enemy on the Quarter of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> whilſt the Body of the Turks Army was imployed in repulſing the violence of the Sally.</p>
                     <p>Things being diſpoſed in this manner, and the morn approaching, the Forces marched out by the Gate of St. <hi>George</hi> with all ſilence poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; covering their Matches, that the fire might not alarm the Enemy; the Onſet was to begin with the dawning of the day, and the Signal was to be given by firing of the chief Mine Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; which being large,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſally at the Gate St. <hi>George</hi>
                        </note> and furniſhed with a great quantity of Powder, might (as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) make way to the ſlaughter of the Turks whom the Chriſtians might find terrified and diſordered by ſuch an unexpected accident. This Mine was reſerved for the laſt extremity, but being low was full of water; ſo that the Powder was ſtowed on floats and rafts to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it, but yet received ſo great a damp and moiſture, that when they came to ſpring it, the Powder took not fire, which was the firſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of this Enterpriſe. Though ſome are of opinion, that the Mine was ſo vaſt, and contained ſuch a quantity of Powder, that the Engineers were timorous to ſpring it, leſt it ſhould reverſe on the Beſieged, as well as take effect on the Enemies Camp. But be it how it will, a quarter of an hour before day the Generals expecting no longer, the Forlorn Hope which lay within half a Musket-ſhot of the Enemy, aſſaulted two Redoubts, took them,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians fall upon the Turks.</note> and put them all to the Sword: with the like courage the other Regiments entred the Line, and making themſelves Maſters of the Trenches after much blood and ſlaughter, and ſtorming a Fort on which was the Battery directed againſt St. <hi>Demetrio,</hi> poſſeſſed themſelves of it, and therewith of a great Magazine of Powder belonging to the Enemy, ſpiking all the Cannon that were found therein.</p>
                     <p>The day by this time being clearly broken out, diſcovered the action; ſo that the Turks with all expedition put themſelves into a Body on the Hill near New <hi>Candy,</hi> from whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and contemning the ſmall number of the Chriſtians, came thundring down in great numbers to regain their Trenches. The Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> perceiving his Forlorn hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, came in to their aſſiſtance with two Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Foot, and two Troops of Horſe, which behaved themſelves with that gallantry, as ingaged the Turks again to quit their Trenches. But whilſt ſucceſs ſeemed thus to ſmile on the Chriſtians, the Magazine of Powder which was newly won, containing an hundred thirty four Kintals of Powder (by what accident is not known) took fire, and blew up all into the air, by which many were deſtroyed and wounded, eſpecially of the Battallion of the Guards, with many Officers. This fatal blow quite turned the Scale of Fortune. For the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:39539:109"/>Souldiers hearing the dreadful clap, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were the Earth to tremble under them, ſuppoſed it to be the eruption of ſome Mine near them,<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Army in confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> with which they were ſo amazed, that they began with confuſion to diſperſe to the right and left, and put themſelves into ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful flight. In like manner the Forces near the Sea ſenſible of the blow, began to retreat, and abandon their deſign, which no perſwaſions of their Officers, or other incouragement could animate them to proſecute; but that the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a ſecond Attempt (an infirmity accorded of ancient Times to be incident to the nature of the French Nation) prevailed upon their ſpirits, beyond any poſſibility of arreſt, ſo that in a diſorderly manner they fled into the Body of the firſt Battalion, where being now united with the Reſerve, they for ſome time ſuſtained the ſhock of the Enemy; until other Bodies of the Turks from New <hi>Candia</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea</hi> over-powered them with greater multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, ſo that then they wholly abandoned the field, and every one as well as he could, ſought his Sanctuary and refuge within the Precincts of the Fortifications. Howſoever <hi>Choiſeul</hi> and <hi>Lebret,</hi> each of which had a Horſe killed under him, incouraging their Troops, diſputed the caſe yet longer, and ſtill with other Officers made head upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but at length with the Duke of <hi>Navailles,</hi> and ſeveral other Gentlemen, who made their way through the Enemy with their Swords, they were forced to retreat honourably into the Town. The Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> was ſaid to have laboured much in reſiſting the ſhameful flight of his men, and venturing his Perſon into danger, from whence he reſolved never to retreat, was overwhelmed with unequal numbers, and ſo fell amongſt the common heaps: but his body, though much ſought after, being not found, it was believed rather, that he periſhed by that fatal Magazine of Powder, which blowing up, affrighted and diſordered the whole Chriſtian Army.</p>
                     <p>But not only did misfortunes attend the Land-Forces, but the Fleet at Sea ſhared in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters. For ſome few days after the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard from the Sea, cauſed the Ships to ride at a diſtance from the ſhore. The whole Fleet conſiſted of eighty Ships ſmall and great, fifty Gallies, and ſix Galleaſſes, being the whole Force of that Year from <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Malta.</hi> All which being at Anchor in due order as near the ſhore as was ſafe or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, made many ſhot into the Turks Camp, but with little execution: during which Action, the <hi>Santa Tereſa,</hi> a French Ship of ſeventy Braſs Guns blew up, and her whole Company loſt, being about three hundred men, of which ſeven only were ſaved; the Admiral of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to this Ship, received five ſhot from her which paſſed through her, and by the Splinters and fall of Timbers; the Veſſel called <hi>La Reale</hi> had ſix Cavaliers killed, and forty Souldiers Slaves were killed and wounded. After this it was propoſed in Council, That another Sally ſhould be made of ten thouſand French; to which the Duke <hi>De Navailles</hi> aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on condition that they might be preceded in the Van by four thouſand Venetians, who were well acquainted and verſed in the nature of the place, and knew the ſeveral Redoubts, Galleries, and Trenches of the Enemy. But the Captain General being deſirous to reſerve his own experienced Souldiers to the ultimate and laſt occaſion of emergency, refuſed to aſſent thereunto.</p>

And though the French in their Voyage home about <hi>Malta</hi> encountred poſitive Orders to remain on the place, yet judging the Town might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready be ſurrendered, and ſo the return diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful and in vain, proceeded notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their courſe for <hi>France,</hi> for which default and want of conſtancy the Duke of <hi>Navailles</hi> being arrived at <hi>Tolon,</hi> ſuſtained the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Princes disfavour, and ordered for ſome time not to approach the Court.</p>
                     <p>The Turks, by departure of the French,<note place="margin">The Turks make an aſſault.</note> increaſing in hopes and courage, made an aſſault on the Quarters of <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea;</hi> and firſt attaquing ſome Souldiers to the number of about thirty, who were placed on the Guard at the Poſt of St. <hi>Pelagia,</hi> they cut moſt of them off, and put the reſt to flight; with which the Turks being more animated, advanced to the Paliſade of the new Rentrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but Vollies of Cannon, and ſhowers of Musket-ſhot, and ſtones pouring on them, gave ſome ſtop to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ury of their career. <hi>Grimaldi</hi> obſerving that the Enemy was at a ſtand, brought up his Voluntiers and Cavalry which ſerved on Foot, and together with the Forces from <hi>Brunſwick</hi> ſo plyed the Turks with ſtones, Granadoes, and ſhot, that the Fight was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, bloody, and horrid; howſoever the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſo perſiſted, that the Commanders gave Order, That the groſs of the Army ſhould fall on; but the Souldiers were ſo broken and torn, that they refuſed to advance, though thruſt forward with the point of Sword and Spear. The Captain-General in the mean time taking his courſe along the Marine, on which part alſo the Turks were far advanced, cauſed a Mine to be ſprang under the thickeſt crowd of the Turks: which conſiſting of an hundred Barrels of Powder, made ſuch a deſtruction, as abated much of the ſtorm, and induced the Enemy to retire within their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts. The Marqueſs St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> in like manner performing the office of a valiant and experienced Souldier, applied himſelf to all
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:39539:110"/>places where danger moſt required his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and recovered certain Breaſt-works which the Enemy had gained in the Skirmiſh.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the ſtorm leſs furious and bloody on the part of <hi>Sabionera,</hi> nor was the ſucceſs and advantage on the Chriſtians ſide leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, in all which the Souldiery deſerved great commendations and renown; the two French Regiments of <hi>Peraſi</hi> and <hi>Jonſac</hi> under the Command of the Sieur <hi>Choiſeul</hi> did won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; as alſo thoſe few which remained of the Regiments of <hi>Savoy</hi> commanded by Signior <hi>Arborio:</hi> Signior <hi>Rados, Micolo Polani</hi> a Noble Venetian, the Proveditor <hi>Cornaro,</hi> the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels <hi>Gabriel, Givii,</hi> and the Sergeant Major of the Troops of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and Serjeant Major <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> as alſo the Commander in cheif of <hi>Malta</hi> gave honourable teſtimonies of their Bravery and Valour. In ſhort the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General praiſed them all, which was the beſt reward he could beſtow on ſuch generous Souls; and then ſent Orders to <hi>Standia,</hi> That the Forces arrived with the Duke <hi>Mirandola</hi> ſhould immediately be landed: theſe Forces, which when they were firſt imbarked, amounted to the number of a thouſand five hundred men, were now by Calentures and other ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes cauſed by the exceſſive heats of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reduced to ſix hundred; and though they were unhealthy and unexperienced Souldiers, yet the extremity of Affairs was ſuch, as called them to immediate ſervice, and to be placed on the Guard of the new Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>But all this could give little relief to the periſhing condition of this miſerable Town; which was not only weakened by departure of the French, but by at leaſt five hundred others, ſuch as Swedes and Germans, and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who notwithſtanding all care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to the contrary, crowded under the French Banner. Likewiſe the Batalion of <hi>Malta</hi> imbarked, which though reduced to a ſmall Body, was yet very conſiderable for the Quality and Valour of the Cavaliers; which example all the Voluntiers followed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reduced the Town to a condition beyond all poſſibility of defence; for that in actual ſervice not above four thouſand men remained, and of theſe at leaſt an hundred a day being killed, the Town muſt neceſſarily in a ſhort time become a prey to the Enemy; wherefore the Captain-General called a Council of the moſt eminent Officers;<note place="margin">A Council for to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the ſtate of <hi>Candia.</hi>

                     </list>
                     <p>All which having taken their places, the Captain General began to declare, That the extremity of the place was ſo well known and evident to them all, that there was no need for him to inform them of the particulars; only that he had called them together to know their opinions and counſels in what manner the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Town might be beſt prolonged, and what advice they would give him touching the preſent premures and emergency of Affairs. He added further, That he had by good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience proved them to be as well judicious and wiſe in their Counſels, as they were valiant in the Execution; and that now was the time to lay aſide all oſtentation of ſpeech, and to attend unto that which was ſolid reaſon and advice, which he deſired every one to deliver freely with a clear and real ſenſe and affection towards the grand Concernment. Then he ordered the Cancellier to read a ſhort preamble of the matter on which they were to deliver their opinions, deſiring every one to expreſs his judgment in Writing; But after ſome few had ſubſcribed their Declaration, ſo much time was ſpent therein, that it was conceived more expedite for every perſon to declare his opinion by word of mouth.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt point all generally concurred, that conſidering the ſmall number of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, the Town could not hold out much longer; for that the Enemy on the ſide of St. <hi>Andrea</hi> was arrived to the laſt Retrenchment, which being low, weak, and compoſed of bad matter, could not long reſiſt their power; that on the ſide alſo of <hi>Sabionera</hi> they were ſo far advanced by the lower grounds towards the Arſenal, that in a ſhort time they would block up the Port, and cut off all proviſions and ſuccours from the Town; and that if the Enemy were reſolved to adventure the loſs of two or three thouſand men by a general ſtorm; there would remain no poſſibility of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Force. This being generally aſſented unto, and concluded on all hands, another Queſtion was propounded; namely, That conſidering the premiſes, what was to be done which might render the moſt effectual ſervice to the Republick; it was well known how important that place was to the Publick, and what vaſt Treaſures of Gold and Silver, and what plentiful Effuſions of bloud had been expended and poured forth in defence thereof; and that therefore it ought to be maintained to the utmoſt and laſt gaſp of ſtrength; but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:39539:110"/>that it ought alſo to be conſidered, That the Town being either taken by aſſault, or the Port blocked up, there would certainly enſue ſuch deplorable Conſequences as every perſon may imagine; and the Republick be damaged by loſing all that which is now in a poſſibility of being ſaved. It was therefore put to the Vote, beginning on the ſide of the Inferiors, as the cuſtom is, and ſo aſcending to the chief; and it was reſolved that they ſhould capitulate, and enter into a Treaty with the Turks. When it came to <hi>Grimaldi</hi>'s turn to ſpeak, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed clearly, That the Town could not hold out for many days, and though it was more glorious to the Defenders to dye on the Walls of it, yet it would be of worſe ſervice to the Publick; howſoever he was of opinion, that rather than ſurrender, it would be better to burn it, or blow it up with Mines; in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, the wounded and unſerviceable people ſhould in the firſt place be ſhipped away, then taking the opportunity of a dark and quiet Night, the Infantry might be all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked; it was true, as he confeſſed, that the action was difficult and full of hazard; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, two things moved him to this Counſel; One was, The little aſſurance he conceived of the faith of the Turks; and the other was, The gloriouſneſs of the action: for as this City had been in an extraordinary manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and of which the World cannot give the like example; ſo the end thereof would not be leſs renowned and famous, it not being a greater triumph to drive the Enemy from the Walls, than being vanquiſht to leave a bloudy Victory, and inſtead of a Palace a heap of ſtones and aſhes. Many of the Council, and amongſt them Marqueſs St. <hi>Andrea Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi> was of the ſame opinion, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary <hi>Minio</hi> endeavoured to ſecond it with efficacious Arguments; But in fine, after a long Diſcourſe, they all concluded that the reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more generous than practicable; by reaſon that ſo many people could not be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked without knowledge of the Enemy, who was not only quartered near, but within the very Walls of the City.</p>
                     <p>The Captain General was of a different opinion; for that beſides the difficulty of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking the Souldiery, there were alſo ſome other conſiderations which might diſſwade this reſolution, and render it more prejudicial to the Publick than a Surrender by Compoſition. After ſome ſhort debate, all at length concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſame ſentiment, from which alſo <hi>Grimaldi</hi> did not much diſſent, confeſſing that the propoſition he had made would prove difficult in the Execution; howſoever, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the little faith which the Turks obſerve, he thought it more ſecure to confide their ſafety to Fortune and their own Swords, than to the engagements and moderation of a perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and enraged Enemy. In ſhort, he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted wholly to the better judgments of the Council, and more particularly to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General, and the Marqueſs of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> who were beſt acquainted with what more nearly concerned the ſervice and intereſt of the Prince.</p>
                     <p>In fine, the concluſion was, That they ſhould enter into a Treaty with the Vizier, and endeavour to obtain the moſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Conditions poſſible. Howſoever, it was thought fit to advertiſe firſt this their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to the Auxiliary Forces at <hi>Standia;</hi> and to renew the inſtances they had formerly made to them for three thouſand men,<note place="margin">Reſult of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.</note> with which, and with two thouſand Gally Slaves they would endeavour the making of another Retrenchment, whereby the Town might be conſerved for ſome time longer. Howſoever, in this Interim the Captain General being willing to touch the Viziers pulſe, that he might better diſcover in what manner he ſtood affected towards a Treaty, diſpatched one Colonel <hi>Thomas Anand,</hi> an Engliſhman, of courage, and of able Parts, and of intire honeſty, together with one <hi>Stefano Cordili,</hi> an intelligent young man to the Vizier's Camp; and that his deſign might not be diſcovered by thoſe of the Town, they were ordered to paſs from <hi>Standia</hi> with a white Flag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> up the River <hi>Gioffiro;</hi> and that being come to a Treaty, they ſhould only diſcover the mind and inclinations of the Turks, without making known their intentions, or entering into par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                     <p>Being come in this manner prepared to the Vizier's Camp, they told the Turks, That they were come to renew the Treaty begun by Signior <hi>Molino,</hi> which had been broken off by the Arrival of the French and Pope's Forces; to which a Turk, then come from the Vizier's Tent, reſolutely anſwered, That they ſhould think of no Articles, nor Treaty without a Surrender, To which <hi>Anand</hi> replyed, That they would do well to acquaint the Vizier ſo much, for that perhaps he might be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion; and ſo not urging farther they departed; but returning after Dinner the ſame Turk came down again, called <hi>Achmet</hi> Aga, a Confident of the Vizier's together with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiotti</hi> the Vizier's Interpreter; and then with more earneſtneſs declaring, That nothing would be heard, unleſs in the firſt place they were reſolved to deliver the Town, and threatned them in caſe they returned without this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: The Captain General being adviſed hereof, the next morning <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili</hi> went again on the ſame meſſage; and meeting the Turks under <hi>Paleocaſtro,</hi> they acquainted them that they had orders to treat about a Surrender; but firſt deſired to know what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles they would give them, and what Town in exchange for this. In this manner a Treaty being begun, it was reſolved for better expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to erect Tents nearer to the Town for the place of Conference, where the Plenipotentia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on both ſides were to meet. <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha, late Paſha of <hi>Aleppo, Achmet</hi> Aga, the Kahya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>begh of the Janiſaries, the Spahyler <hi>Agaſi,</hi> and the Interpreter <hi>Panaiotri,</hi> were the perſons choſen by the Turks on the part of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, after ſome Debate, no other perſons were choſen beſides <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili,</hi> who meeting the Turks at the time and place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, demanded of them ſome other place in exchange for that of <hi>Candia.</hi> To which the Turks with ſome heat replyed, That it was againſt their Law to deliver Towns where Moſchs were built, into the hands of Chriſtians. To which the others anſwered, That this could not be their Law, ſince that in a Treaty ſome months paſt begun by the Cavelier <hi>Molino,</hi> they had offered to deliver up into the hands of the Chriſtians <hi>Candia Nuova, Sitia,</hi> and <hi>Girapitra,</hi> all places where Mahometan
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:39539:111"/>Moſchs were erected; and though the Turks might now imagine it eaſie to win the Town by force, they aſſured them that greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties remained; and that if they remembred what bloud, what labours, and what Treaſures their ſmall acqueſts and advance had coſt them, they might thence calculate what Force ſtill remained to conquer, and that the laſt gaſp of this dying Fortreſs would ſpend it ſelf with more ruine and deſtruction than they had felt in all the other approaches and aſſaults there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. In fine, the Turks ſeeming reſolved to be ſole Maſters of the whole Kingdom of <hi>Candia,</hi> the Venetians began to condeſcend to receive ſome compenſation in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>Howſoever, the difficulties were not yet ended but greater appeared, for the Turks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded ſatisfaction for the charge of the War; and the Haratch or head-mony, which for all thoſe years of the Wars they had not received from the people of the Iſles of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipelago;</hi> they demanded alſo a Tribute for the Forts and Iſlands of <hi>Cerigo, Tino,</hi> and <hi>Cliſſa,</hi> and the other Conqueſts in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> all which points cauſed new Diſputes, which were maintained with thoſe heats, and with that obſtinacy, as if it had been impoſſible for both parties ever to meet in a concluſion. Notwithſtanding, after long Debates, on the fourth of <hi>September</hi> they came to agree of giving hoſtages, and to certain propoſals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the manner of ſurrendring the place. The Turks demanded to have the Outworks put into their hands, with one of the Gates of the City, and the Paliſade of the new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment: To which <hi>Anand</hi> and <hi>Scordili</hi> anſwered, That this was not a propoſition to be made to the Captain General, for that they were aſſured, the Garriſon would ſooner ſuffer themſelves to be cut in pieces, than to commit themſelves to the mercy of the Turkiſh Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery; whoſe faith is recorded in the Hiſtory of <hi>Famaguſta,</hi> and may ſerve for a true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and mirror of their treachery and faithleſneſs to all Ages. In this manner the Treaty had like to have been broken off; but at length they concluded, That it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to render an accout to the Vizier of the particulars of this Conference, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing the Treaty until the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding all which, the Turks did not abate in the leaſt point their progreſs in the War, labouring in their Works, and fighting with more heat than ever. The Venetians on the other ſide were not leſs active, firing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually their Cannon and Granadoes, and making ſome little Sallies, endeavoured as much as they were able to cover the weakneſs of their Forces. The Turks had raiſed a new Battery which broke a great part of the Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade of the new Retrenchment, upon which it was expected that they ſhould make a ſtrong attempt, for whoſe better entertainment two Mines were prepared to receive them; but they deferring the aſſault, the Captain General gave orders to fire both the Mines at once, which conſiſting of a hundred and fifty Barrels of Powder, made the ground to tremble both in the City and in the Camp, overthrowing ſeveral works with miſerable ſlaughter of the Enemy.</p>
                     <p>The Turks obſerving this reſolution in the defendants, became more tractable, and leſs ſevere in their demands; ſo that <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha with the reſt contented themſelves with no other ſecurity for performances of Conditions than Hoſtages; of which three were conſigned mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually on both ſides. After which, other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were, with leſs Difficulty, concluded; ſo that in the morning of the <hi>6th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the Turks demanded that the Chriſtians ſhould give all their Articles in Writing; whereupon the Council ordered <hi>Grimaldi</hi> to draw them up; which were in ſubſtance as followeth.</p>
                     <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace.</note> That for obtaining a good and laſting Peace, it is agree'd, That the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> with all its Cannon which were planted there before the time of the War, be conſigned into the hands of the Vizier.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That quiet poſſeſſion be given to the Republick of <hi>Suda, Carabuſa,</hi> and <hi>Spina Longa,</hi> with the Territories thereunto belonging, with the Fortreſs of <hi>Cliſſa</hi> in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Venetians may carry away all the Cannon which have been brought into the Town ſince the beginning of the War.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That for embarking the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, Pionieers, and Inhabitants of all Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Conditions, with their Arms, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Baggage twelve days time ſhall be granted and aſſigned.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, That what ſhall remain unſhipped at the end of the twelve days aforeſaid, the Vizier ſhall, with his own Boats, aſſiſt to the lading thereof.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, That during this time of truce, no perſon whatſoever ſhall tranſgreſs his Limits, or paſs the bounds of his Station or Quarters; and that he who doth ſhall be treated as an Enemy.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, That ſo ſoon as theſe Articles ſhall be ſubſcribed under the white Flag, all Acts of Hoſtility ſhall ceaſe both on one ſide and the other.</p>
                     <p>Eighthly, That for ſecurity of performance of theſe Articles, three Hoſtages be mutually given on one ſide and the other.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly, That for better aſſurance, that the Venetians will uſe all their endeavours to embark their Men and Goods, the Turks may employ two Officers for Eye-witneſſes of the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, That for better effecting hereof, all Ships, Gallies, and other Veſſels may freely approach near unto the ſhore, and enter into the Port both by Day and Night.</p>
                     <p>Eleventhly, That the Venetian Fleet may remain at <hi>Standia,</hi> or at any other Iſland in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> until ſuch time as they are diſpatched, or that things are duly prepared for their departure.</p>
                     <p>Twelfthly, That all Commiſſions given by one ſide and the other be revoked, and that whoſoever ſhall after the ſpace of forty days commit any Act of Hoſtility againſt the tenor of theſe Articles of Peace, ſhall be puniſhed with capital puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>Thirteenly, That ſo ſoon as an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor from <hi>Venice</hi> ſhall arrive at the Port, all Slaves or Priſoners of War taken under the Venetian Colours ſhall be freed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed.</p>
                     <p>Fourteenthly, That what depredations ſhall be made at Sea or Land after theſe Articles
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:39539:111"/>are ſubſcribed, and before the publication thereof, ſhall be faithfully made good and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored.</p>
                     <p>Fifteenthly, That a general pardon be given to the Subjects of both ſides, who have acted contrary to their Faith and Allegiance, during this War.</p>
                     <p>Sixteenthly, That in Vertue of theſe Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations the former Articles be likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed which were made in the Year 1571, and that no Tribute or Preſent be demanded from the Port, unleſs as hath formerly been paid for ſuch Iſlands as the Venetians hold in the <hi>Archipelago.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventeenthly, That of theſe Articles two Copies be made, one in Turkiſh with its Tranſlation into Italian, ſubſcribed by the Vizier, and ſealed with the Grand Signior's Signet; and the other in Italian underwrote by the Captain-General, and ſealed with the Seal of the Republick.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Articles being ſigned, the Hoſtages were given both on one ſide and the other. Thoſe given by the Venetians were <hi>Fauſtino da Riva</hi> Lieutenant-General, <hi>Giovanni Battiſta Calbo</hi> Commiſſary, and <hi>Zaccaria Mocenigo</hi> who had been Duke of <hi>Candia.</hi> Thoſe given by the Turks were <hi>Belin Aſſan</hi> Paſha, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Aga of the Janiſaries, and <hi>Gurgi Bei</hi> Tefterdar or Treaſurer.</p>
                     <p>During this Siege, of the Venetians ſide there were killed and wounded thirty thouſand nine hundred eighty five, of the Turks one hundred eighteen thouſand ſeven hundred fifty four.</p>
                     <p>The Batteries which the Turks raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Sabionera</hi> and St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> conſiſted of fifty nine Pieces of Cannon, carrying from fifty to an hundred and twenty pound weight of Bullet.</p>
                     <p>The Storms which the Turks made upon the Town were fifty ſix.</p>
                     <p>The Combats under ground forty five.</p>
                     <p>The Sallies made by the Venetians ninety ſix.</p>
                     <p>The Mines and Fornelli ſprang by the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians eleven hundred ſeventy three, by the Turks four hundred ſeventy two.</p>
                     <p>The Venetians ſpent Barrels of Powder fifty thouſand three hundred and ſeventeen.</p>
                     <p>Bomboes of all ſorts by the Venetians of fifty to five hundred weight, were forty eight thouſand an hundred and nineteen.</p>
                     <p>Granadoes of Braſs and Iron an hundred thouſand nine hundred and ſixty: Granadoes of Glaſs eighty four thouſand eight hundred ſeventy four.</p>
                     <p>Cannon ſhot of all ſorts two hundred ſeventy ſix thouſand ſeven hundred forty three.</p>
                     <p>Pounds of Lead eighteen millions forty four thouſand nine hundred fifty ſeven. Of Match pounds thirteen millions twelve thouſand five hundred.</p>
                     <p>What quantities the Turks might conſume of Ammunition is not certain; only it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, That the Braſs taken up in the ſtreets which came from the Enemies Bomboes was ſo much, that whole Ware-houſes were filled with the Metal, and ſo much ſold as yielded many thouſands of Crowns.</p>
                     <p>The Articles being ſubſcribed, and Hoſtages given, the Captain-General attended with all application of mind and induſtry imaginable to imbark the Men and Ammunition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting in the mean time the care of the City to <hi>Cornaro</hi> the Proveditor of the Fleet.</p>
                     <p>During theſe days that all things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding in order to a Surrender, there was great ſilence in the Turkiſh Camp, and no diſorder in the City; the Souldiers on the Ramparts, and the Turks in their Trenches ſaluted each other with civility, and entertained communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and diſcourſes together with friendſhip and freedom of ſeveral paſſages relating to their War, nothing of quarrel, or ſcuffle, or rude words happening out between them in all the term of the twelve days. The Vizier ſent divers times civil Meſſages and Preſents of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment to the Captain-General and Marqueſs St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which they returned with equal reſpect and generoſity; and ſo exceſſive were the Turks in theſe offices, that the Venetians began to be jealous, leſt under this mark and guiſe of courteſie ſome fraud or deſign ſhould be covered according to their own Proverb: <hi>Chi ti fa piu carezze che ſuole, ó ti ha engannato ó enganar ti vuole.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſhort, all things were diſpatched with that diligence and care, that on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> the City was conſigned; all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants departed thence, not one remaining in the City, except only two Greek Prieſts, a Woman, and three Jews.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the Whole Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The War began in <hi>April 1645.</hi>
                        </note> the cauſe and occaſion of all that Blood and Treaſure that was ſpilt, and exhauſted in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five years War, fell at length to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and increaſe of the Turkiſh Empire, with its moſt impregnable Fortreſs of the World, ſtrengthened with as much Art and Induſtry, as the human Wit of this Age was capable to invent, after a ſtrait Siege of two years, three months, and twenty ſeven days. For the ſpace of twelve days allotted for the Surrender being expired,<note place="margin">Candia <hi>delivered.</hi>
                        </note> on the <hi>27/17th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> being Friday, the great Croſs erected on the Wall was after midnight taken down, and advice given to the Venetians, ſo ſoon as the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dawned, that the Turks did that day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Surrender, which was accordingly performed by the Principal Citizen about nine of the clock of the ſame morning who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Keys of the City to the Great Vizier in a Baſon of Silver on the breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> was by him preſented with a Veſt of Sables, and five hundred Zechins in Gold, and to his Servants were given two hundred. To <hi>Moroſini</hi> alſo a Preſent was offered worthy his Quality; but he refuſed it, ſaying, That he would never give a ſeeming occaſion to the malicious World to ſlander him with the leaſt appearance of having ſold his important Charge. Whilſt theſe things were tranſacting on the breach, ſome of the moſt cowardly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly amongſt the Janiſaries preſſed forward to have entred by force, in violation of the Articles ſo lately agreed and confirmed; but ſome of the Garriſon not yet imbarked, keeping themſelves ſtill on the Guard, repulſed the moſt forward in the Riot by killing three or four of their Companions: which diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and inſolence of the Souldiery, when made known to the Vizier, he aſſembled the diſorderly together; and firſt upbraiding their cowardiſe, who durſt not enter in the time of War, would now counterfeit Valour in the time of Peace, ſentenced fifteen of them to be impaled on the breach, which piece of Juſtice
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:39539:112"/>and Gallantry was immediately executed. This rumour being appeaſed, the <hi>Topegibaſhee</hi> and <hi>Cebegibaſhee,</hi> or the Generals of the Ordnance and Arms took quiet poſſeſſion of the Forts and Cannon of the City, and whilſt the Turks entred over the breach, the Chriſtian Army withdrew and imbarked themſelves as faſt as convenience and decency would permit, who after the departure of the French, and of ſuch who accompanied them, were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be above two thouſand five hundred men, and thoſe ſickly, ill accoutred, and half naked; and thus this City and whole Iſland became ſubject and a prey to the Ottoman Arms. Amongſt the Officers which took poſſeſſion of the Town were the Tefterdar and the Aga of the Janiſaries. The Tefterdar as he paſſed over the breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> and obſerving how low and weak the Works were on that ſide, turned to the Aga of the Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and with ſome diſdain ſaid to him, We have here ſpent ten days in the Surrender of this Town which we might have taken in two hours.</p>
                     <p>The Turkiſh Army taking poſſeſſion on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the <hi>27/17th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the Vizier made his Entry on Friday the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>October;</hi> in which time they had erected a triumphant Bridge over the breach of St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> on which the Vizier entred into the Town, and paſſed directly to the Church of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> which was converted to a Mahometan Moſch, where having ſaid his Namaz or Prayer, he went to the houſe where the Marqueſs St. <hi>Andrea</hi> was lodged, which was prepared for him, with a ſumptuous Entertainment of five hundred Diſhes at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the Grand Signior.</p>
                     <p>This City in four parts of five was ruined and demoliſhed in the time of the Siege, all the Bells and Ornaments of the Churches and Houſes to the very Locks of the doors were carried away; the Arms remaining were old and ruſty, and not above three hundred and fifty Pieces of Cannon left on the Walls, and thoſe for the moſt part very ſmall: the Inhahitants remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were only five, as we have ſaid before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome few decrepit Jews and Greeks, which might make up the number of about thirty; ſo that never could be a more ſad ſpectacle of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, nor a more clear Mirror of the miſeries of War.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier being poſſeſſed of the Town, diſpatched away an Expreſs with the good News thereof to the Sultan, who poſted as faſt as wind and weather would permit. And here the Reader may eaſily apprehend what joy poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the minds of the Turks in all places where the rumour flew of this Cities Surrender, which had for ſo many years baffled and put a ſtand to the Ottoman Sword, And though the joyful tidings added wings to the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers haſt, yet the uncertainty of the Grand Signiors abode retarded ſome dayes the arrival of the News: which will ſeem very ſtrange to him that conſiders, that the motion of ſo great an Emperour in the Glory of his Fortunes ſhould be leſs obſcure than the light of the Sun, perceptible by all conditions, who inhabit that ſide of the Globe, where his rays are viſible. At length the Meſſenger found the Sultan with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Woods and Mountains of <hi>Nogyopont</hi> where he had paſſed the heats of the Summer,<note place="margin">The News brought to the Grand Signior at <hi>Negro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pont.</hi>
                        </note> and ſome part of his diſcontent in thoſe ſolitary retirements: it being now towards the end of <hi>September,</hi> and the Winter approaching, the Iſle was incapable to entertain ſo great a Court, and to return back ſeemed as diſhonourable as it was dangerous, the Souldiery and People being equally diſcontented, the one by the ill ſucceſs and government of Affairs, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by oppreſſion of Taxes: but this joyful News cleared all thoſe clouds and ombrages of doubtful and diſconſolate thoughts, which the Grand Signior received like a dream, being at firſt ſo ſurpriſed with ſuch an unexpected hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that he could ſcarce believe it; but at length recollecting his ſcattered ſpirits, without delay returned the Meſſenger again with his Embrahore or Maſter of his Horſe to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier with the Preſent of a Sable Veſt, a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and a Sword, being the uſual ſignals of the Sultans favour, and with a Letter freighted with Encomiums and Praiſes of his Valour and Fortune. And whereas the Vizier had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he anſwered, That he was reſolved to winter at <hi>Salonica,</hi> where with the Spring he expected his preſence, and from thence in company with him, ſhould be ready to chuſe any Seat, which in his judgment the Vizier apprehended moſt conducing to the benefit of the Empire.</p>
                     <p>The Captain-General <hi>Moroſini</hi> having in the mean time imbarked his Forces, ſailed to <hi>Suda</hi> to provide and fortifie that place, <hi>Spina Longa</hi> and <hi>Carabuſa,</hi> poor Rocks and Appendages to the greater Iſle of <hi>Candia,</hi> with all neceſſary ſupplies of Victuals and Ammunition: which only ſerve for a Proſpect into <hi>Candia,</hi> and to keep alive the Title of the Venetian Republick to that Kingdom. <hi>Suda</hi> is the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the three, but yet not ſtrong, the Sea being fordable between that and <hi>Candia,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians at <hi>Suda.</hi>
                        </note> and not of long reſiſtance, whenſoever the Turk ſhall think it worth his time to ſubdue. Here <hi>Moroſini</hi> attended the Ratification of the Peace from <hi>Venice,</hi> and the disbanding of the Turkiſh Army, in which time four French Ships with Succours of Men and Ammunition arrived at <hi>Candia,</hi> but coming late were diſappointed of their deſign, and ſo returned back into their own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Turks having now finiſhed their work, diſpeeded a way their Janiſaries and Pioniers by all occaſions of ſhipping: thoſe that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were imployed all the Winter in filling the Trenches without the City, and many Slaves taken out of the Gallies to repair the breach of St. <hi>Andrea:</hi> in which work, whilſt they threw up the difordered rubbiſh, ſo poyſonous a ſtench evaporated from the bodies of the ſlain, which lay buried in thoſe ruines, as begat a Peſtilence and other diſeaſes in the City and in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; but labouring continually on that work, they ſoon acquitted themſelves of the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by help of the Winters cold which then approached.</p>
                     <p>In this manner expired the Action of this Year, fortunate in its ſucceſs to the Turks; for though they gained but thirty Acres of Land with expence ineſtimable of Blood and Treaſure, yet the Glory and Fame which attended it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſummation of twenty five years Wars, and the Theatre where the whole World were Spectators, was of greater value to the Turks than any other conſideration, and may with time prove a place of advantage to the farther increaſe of their Weſtern Empire,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:39539:112"/>unleſs God Almighty by his Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence give a ſtop to the progreſs of this Grand Oppreſſour.</p>
                     <p>But before this Year ended,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Serini</hi> and the Nobles of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> offer themſelves to the Turk.</note> behold the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of Chriſtendom, by reaſon of diſcontents and animoſities in the Imperial Court, the Count <hi>Serini</hi> Prince of <hi>Croatia,</hi> the Marqueſs <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipani</hi> and Count <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> joyned with other Nobles of <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſent Meſſengers to the Grand Signior offering themſelves Subjects and Tributaries to the Turk, deſiring his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their Religion and Liberties, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to act the part of <hi>Bethlem Gabor.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier imployed himſelf this whole Winter paſt in repairing the Fortifications of <hi>Candia,</hi> regulating them in ſome meaſure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Turkiſh Model, and in repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beautifying the Town, which was done with ſuch admirable expedition, that in a few months moſt of the houſes demoliſhed in the time of the Siege were again erected, and the Churches converted into Moſchs and adorned, three of the principal whereof took the Names of the Grand Signior, Great Vizier and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paſha, and were endowed by them with an honourable Revenue, ſufficient to maintain them in Reparations, Lamps, and Taliſmans. But the Turks were not more pious towards their Moſchs than the Chriſtians were careleſs and cold towards their Churches; for the Venetians inſerted not one Article in favour of a Chriſtian Church or a Religious Houſe, which would have been granted as ſoon as demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, only a Greek who was Interpreter to the Great Vizier called <hi>Panaiotti,</hi> a Perſon of Parts and Learning, at the expence of two thouſand two hundred Dollars; and an Armenian Merchant called <hi>Apro Chelabei</hi> at the charge of a thouſand four hundred purchaſed two Churches for their reſpective Nations.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior in the mean time return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Salonica</hi> to paſs the remainder of the Winter, which place being famous for multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of all ſorts of Game,<note place="margin">The <hi>G.</hi> Signior returns to <hi>Salonica,</hi> and hunts.</note> drew is heart, and made him impatient till he arrived thoſe Plains, more deſired by him than the Elyſian fields; for having made his Entry into that City, the next day he deſigned to hunt: but being put in mind that the Engliſh Ambaſſadour Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey,</hi> his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, hath his Audience of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.</note> who (as we ſaid) arrived at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> the year before, attended his Audience, he was contented to grant it to him the next morning. But yet not to loſe his hunting, at midnight he ſent Officers to the Ambaſſadour to prepare for the next days Audience very early; and to gain time, ordered his Horſes to be all ready, that ſo having diſpatched that Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he might immediately mount into the Saddle and purſue his Game. Howſoever he was not in ſo much haſte, but he teſtified due reſpect to His Majeſty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> and the eſteem he had of the Engliſh Nation, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Capitulations to be renewed; and commanding the Chimacam, that if any one ſhould break or infringe them, that he ſhould cut him off without farther argument. But as to renewing the Capitulations, the Chimacam falling at the Grand Signiors feet, beſeeched him, That that particular might be deferred until the arrival of the Great Vizier, whoſe proper power and act it was to make War and Peace; and therefore for him to intermeddle about Capitulations was to invade the Viziers, Authority, which he durſt not do without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his life in danger, or at leaſt rendring his Perſon obnoxious to his irreconcileable diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; with which the Grand Signior being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, ordered that the renewing of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations ſhould be deferred until the return of the Viſiier, and ſo diſmiſſed the Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour from his Preſence; but this work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Capitulations was reſerved for the care and conduct of Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the Embaſſy after the death of Sir <hi>Danil Harvey.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior ariſing from his Throne mounted into his Saddle to follow his exceſſive delight in Hunting, which now he purſued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day without reſpect of cold or wet, or Horſes or Attendants; but like an impetuous <hi>Nimrod</hi> raged amongſt the timorous Hares and flying Harts, over-ſpreading the Woods with vaſt numbers of poor Jews and Peaſants, which he had commanded forth to drive for Game, not reſpecting the extreme rigour and Froſts of Winter, by which many of thoſe poor Wretches lying abroad in the nights, were benumbed, and dyed. And ſo far did his humour tranſport him in this Recreation, that he was diſcouraged at no inconvenience or labours which attended it; for one day appointing his Hunting at a certain place, which to paſs on Horſe-back was a great circuit, but a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cut over a Gulf or Arm of the Sea, he ordered his Horſes round, whilſt he in Perſon attended with the Chimacam and ſeveral of his Grandees, paſſed over to the other ſide in a Gally. But being impatient of his Sport, and not able to give time to his Horſes to make their way, aſcended his Gally, commanding them to row away with all ſpeed; and arriving at the other ſide ſome hours before His Horſes could come, would yet land: and being weary of expectation, reſolved to meet them on foot through all the dirt and mire of a low and rich ſoil: where whilſt he travelled heavily, and almoſt tried, by good fortune they eſpied a Miller driving his Horſe laden with two Sacks of Meal; whom when they had called, and made him to lighten his burden, and take off the Pack-ſaddle, the Chimacam himſelf ſtripped off his own Sables Veſt, and covered the Horſe with it, on which the Grand Signior mounting in great ſtate, rode like a Prince till he met his own Retinue, which paſſage ſerved to fill the diſcourſe at night of that days Hunting, and deſerves to be chronicled with our Engliſh Dialogue between the Miller and the King: howſoever we make uſe of it here to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſtrange and paſſionate humour which poſſeſſed this Sultan in his Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Little other recreation did this Grand Signior take,<note place="margin">The <hi>G.</hi> Signior de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights ſolely in his Queen.</note> unleſs it were in the Company of his chief Sultana, called the Haſaki Sultana, by whom having had a Son, which beginning now to play and ſpeak, reconciled much of his affection to the Female Sex, but yet with that moderation and well regulated love, that he confined him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly to this one Woman, having ſent for her to be his Companion in all journies and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of Errantry, whilſt the other Ladies as incumbrances and impediments to the ſpeedy motions of the wandring Court, were diſpeeded to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> under the Government of the Queen Mother, as we have before declared; of which priviledge this Sultana beginning to be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:39539:113"/>ſenſible, endeavoured to encreaſe and conſerve the Affections of her Lord by all the arts and tricks of love imaginable; for ſhe was really, or elſe feigned to be, ſo enamoured of him, that ſhe pined and macerated away her ſelf for his abſence; and when he was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his health, or intended a long Journey from her, ſhe would fall into Swoundings, and Paralytical Fits, or ſomething elſe, which was an undoubted ſymptom of true affection, ſuch as commonly intervenes amongſt us in the chaſt embraces of ſingle marriage; that the Grand Signior, whoſe love to Women were not naturally as vagrant as his delights after the chaſe of wild Beaſts, was ſo much ſatisfied in her alone, that he could be no more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her than ſhe without him; ſo that, like <hi>Diana,</hi> or ſome Mountain Nymph, ſhe became a Huntreſs after her Prince, as he a Ranger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Game.</p>

It was but the night before, that certain Meſſengers from Count <hi>Serini,</hi> and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents arrived at this Court, proffering to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Standart from the Grand Signior, and pay him Tribute, ſo they might obtain the power and protection of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms againſt the Emperour. This propoſition though in appearance ſo advantagious, that it might ſeem to admit of no doubt in the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; yet both the Grand Signior and the Chimacam were ſo ready after the late ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at <hi>Candia</hi> to joyn in their Complement to the Vizier, that they would neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, nor give anſwer to theſe Meſſengers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til firſt they had conſulted his ſence, and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the proffer, wherefore to looſe no time according to the uſual expedition of the <hi>Turks,</hi> two gallies were the very ſame night diſpatched with theſe Meſſengers to the Vizier at <hi>Candia,</hi> to give him notice of this tender, and to demand his counſel, and aſſent thereunto: with like ſpeed the gallies were returned with the Viziers approbation, though afterwards on better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations the <hi>Turks</hi> touched this cauſe ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, that <hi>Serini</hi> and his complices being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, the plot Miſcarried and the Conſpirators brought to condigne puniſhment, as ſhall hereafter be related; what ſuſpition the Counſel at <hi>Vienna</hi> might have of this deſign is uncertain, yet this is out of all doubt, that they had no aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured knowledge thereof, until it was firſt brought them by Mr. <hi>Hedges;</hi> and yet ſo much time was taken up herein, as that he travailed from <hi>Salonica</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he arrived the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>January,</hi> and there remaining ſome time for the better Setlement of his affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his journy thence for <hi>England,</hi> by Land he departed on the <hi>14th.</hi> of <hi>Feburary,</hi> and on the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> following, was by Leiutenant General <hi>Eſterhas</hi> received in to <hi>Raab,</hi> to whom giving this firſt Intelligence about <hi>Serini,</hi> and his adherents, was courteouſly treated, but yet detained, until advice was given hereof to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Montecuculi</hi> then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> and his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe, and paſs given to Mr. <hi>Hedges</hi> for his farther proceedings in his journy. Anſwer hereof being returned, he had licence given him to depart, and a guard to conduct him ſafe to <hi>Vienna,</hi> which is very neceſſary on thoſe Frontiers. At <hi>Vienna</hi> Mr. <hi>Hedges</hi> being examined upon Oath by Count <hi>Capelliers</hi> to the truth of the foregoing Relation, Troops were immediately diſpatched to the Caſtle of <hi>Serini,</hi> where they ſo ſeaſonably arrived, as to take poſſeſſion of it for the Emperour ſome few hours before the Turkiſh Forces, (having received a ſtop by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the bridge) came to seize it for the Grand Signior: (Count <hi>Serini</hi> perceiving by this Act, that his deſign, was diſcovered, fled with <hi>Frangipani</hi> his Father-in-law towards <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> but being on his way thither over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the Emperours Edict, he was toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Frangipani</hi> ſeized at Colonel <hi>Careis</hi> Houſe, and thence brought to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and lodged at the Convent of Father <hi>Nicholas Donilard</hi> an Iriſh Frier in the Suburbs of that city; where <hi>Serini</hi> having ſeen, and diſcourſed perſonally with Mr. <hi>Hedges,</hi> he declared to him, <hi>That if the Turks had been, as good as their words, he had not been there a priſoner at that time.</hi> In this particular two things ſeem ſtrange, and unuſual. Firſt on the <hi>Turks</hi> ſide, that a matter of this ſecrecy ſhould be ſo openly divulged and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed by them at <hi>Salonica:</hi> And ſecondly, on the Emperours part, that a buſineſs of this Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance commonly known at the Grand Signor's Court, ſhould want a perſon to advice, and transfer it to <hi>Vienna;</hi> until it came acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to be publiſhed by a ſtranger, who having taken a circuit with it by way of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and his leiſure there to accomodate his own affairs, vented it rather as a Subject of diſcourſe, then a new diſcovery. 'Tis true, the <hi>Turks</hi> are very commonly open in their counſels, and have a qualitie to keep nothing ſecret though recommended to them under never ſo many Injunctions of privacy: yet that the Emperour who commonly maintains a Miniſter tending at the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Court, ſhould have no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence hereof, then ſuch an accidental, and unexpected conveyance, is a matter which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords occaſion to upbraid the Negligence of the <hi>Germans,</hi> and at the ſame time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and praiſe the divine Providence and Juſtice.</p>

                     <p>THE Spring coming forward, the Great Vizier declared, That after St. <hi>George</hi>'s day, which is the <hi>23d</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> (called by the Turks <hi>Caſſim gheun</hi>) he reſolved to depart from <hi>Candia;</hi> and therefore ordered, That all Ships, Saiks, Brigantines, and other Veſſels, which were found in any Port of the Grand Signior's Dominions, ſhould be ſent to <hi>Candia,</hi>
                        <pb n="223" facs="tcp:39539:113"/>to tranſport him and the remainder of his Army to <hi>Rhodeſto</hi> in <hi>Romelia,</hi> from whence he deſigned his March to meet the Grand Signior at <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Vizier takes a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the whole Iſle of <hi>Candia.</hi>
                        </note> But before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he took a view of the Iſland, taking his progreſs through the whole circumference of it, and numbring all the Inhabitants which paid Harach, or Pole-mony, found them not to exceed two and twenty thouſand perſons. For though in the time of <hi>Dellee Mehmet</hi> Paſha, who was the firſt that brought the Ottoman Sword into that Country, there were liſted fifty five thouſand, who paid duties of Harach; yet now the Plague, the Sword, and other miſeries of War had reduced them to that ſmall number, of whom ten thouſand (as is reported) periſhed in the Mines, and before the Walls of their own City; and great numbers of Olive-Trees being cut down and burned by the Souldiery in tiem of the War, is the reaſon that that Iſland yields not half the quantity of Oils as in former times.</p>
                     <p>The Ambaſſador of <hi>Venice</hi> Signior <hi>Aliviſé Molino,</hi> before mentioned, was now at <hi>Candia,</hi> deſigning to accompany the Vizier in his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to the Grand Signior; for adorning which Embaſſy the Republick had appointed a Ship to carry the Preſents and ſeveral Perſons of Quality for attendance of the Bailo (for ſo their Ambaſſador is called;) and in regard in that paſſage the ſhip was to touch at <hi>Zant,</hi> they laded on her a hundred thouſand Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins for payment of that Souldiery, which with the Captain General were returned from <hi>Candia</hi> to that place, with Preſents for the Grand Signior and his Court; but it pleaſed God, that this Ship failing down the Gulf, met with ſo furious a ſtorm of Wind, that ſhe ſuffered ſhipwrack on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> where not only the ſhip and goods were loſt, but every ſoul upon that ſhip periſhed; amonſt which was <hi>Lorenzo Molino</hi> Son of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and <hi>Ottavio Labia,</hi> another noble Venetian.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier entertained himſelf ſo long in <hi>Candia</hi> that the month of <hi>May</hi> was well entered before he departed thence;<note place="margin">The Vizier departs from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and arrives at Scio.</note> and by the way touched at <hi>Scio,</hi> where he was met by all the Officers and Governors of the adjacent Juriſdictions, who came to made tender of their Preſents and Services; but the Vizier in a plauſible manner, accepted of their courteous Offers, but returned their Gifts, ſaying, That he was ſo ſenſible of the great oppreſſions and expences the neighbouring Countries had ſuffered by reaſon of the War, that he was reſolved to ſuperinduce no new Charge by Victory and Peace.</p>
                     <p>In like manner from all parts was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of poor oppreſſed people, who came to petition for juſtice and relief againſt the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and tyranny of their Governors in the reſpective Countries. But the Vizier admitted no Audience for Complaints, whether it were to maintain an apprehenſion of his clemency and gentleneſs, by acting nothing that was cruel or ſevere, or to enjoy himſelf after his cares and turmoils in the War; he almoſt for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days continuance entertained himſelf in private by the cool and cryſtalline Fountains of <hi>Scio.</hi> Some report, that he gave himſelf at that time ſo exceſſively to Wine, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at his ſucceſs, and concluſion of the War, that he was never capable, during his abode there, of ſerious thoughts or counſels; ſo that his Kahya, or Secretary, could hever be ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted acceſs, unleſs he were called, though on the moſt urgent occaſion of buſineſs. Others interpreted his retirements to be in order to ſerious conſiderations about the management of Affairs at his return; as how to ſatisfie the expectations of the Grandees, who patiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an amendment of abuſes in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how he might pacifie the minds of the Souldiery, who were jealous of Couſpiracies againſt the lives of the Royal Brothers, and how to ſteer in an even courſe at Court between the ſecurity of his Maſter, and ſatisfaction of the Vulgar; for all the World lived in hope that alteration of times would amend abuſes, and that the laſt remedy of all was the return of the Viziers Authority. Howſoever, it is certainly reported, That the Vizier was become exceedingly intemperate in wine, and drowned much of his cares in the fumes and vapours of it, ſuppoſing himſelf, as <hi>Tiberius</hi> did in <hi>Caprea,</hi> exempt from the eyes of the World, whilſt he remained in <hi>Scio,</hi> which the Sea had ſeparated from the greater Continent.<note place="margin">The Great Vizier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to drink wine.</note> And yet the Vizier, is believed, never to have taſted Wine, or known whether it was bitter or ſweet, till the pride of his ſucceſs in <hi>Candia</hi> tranſported him to make his joy extravagant, to which the Officers about his Perſon invited him, as that which cheared the ſpirits, ſtrengthened the Nerves, and induced a ſtrange kind of delight and pleaſure in the fancy, beyond any thing of Poppies, or Opiate Compoſitions, or <hi>Biram</hi>-Paſha's Pills, or Berſe, or a thouſand other inventions, fit only to confuſe mens reaſon, and ſtupifie the brain, and benumb all the ſenſes, in which ſome, as I have heard, had ſo practiſed themſelves by degrees, that they could ſwallow five drams in twenty four hours, though I never knew any, unleſs one Turk, whom I ſaw eat above three; but then they could eat nothing elſe, nor were they fit after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to receive or digeſt any other nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Nature being uſed to that poyſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected all other founder nutriment. But Wine (they ſaid) cheared the heart in that manner, and comforted the ſtomach, that the Turks began now generally to drink it, unleſs he were ſome Phariſaical Hypocrite of the Ula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, or ſome ſuperſtitious aged and ignorant Profeſſor.<note place="margin">The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and other Turks drink Wine to exceſs.</note> So that the vice of drunkenneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came more common amongſt the Turks, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Germans, or our ſelves: I am ſure more intolerable, and adminiſtred to more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, by how much the Turks being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Wine, knew leſs how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the heats of Intemperance.</p>
                     <p>And here I ſhall make a little digreſſion from my purpoſe in hand to acquaint my Reader of the effects which I have obſerved to be produced in thoſe who accuſtom themſelves to the uſe of Opium.<note place="margin">A digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about Opium.</note> In all the Country Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages amongſt the Turks, the more aged ſort of men who have moſt leiſure, and leaſt neceſſity to work, addict themſelves to Opium for alleviation (as they ſay) of their cares, and to forget their ſorrow, for pleaſure in the taſte there can be none, being very bitter to the palate; which being taken in a morning in a ſmall quantity, about the bigneſs of a Tare, ſuperinduces at firſt a ſtrange chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs about the heart, and thence raiſes a more pleaſing vapor to the head, than any
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:39539:114"/>can proceed from the ſpirits of the beſt and the higheſt Wines: but afterwards as it begins to digeſt, the vapour becomes more groſs, and conſequently a kind of ſtupefaction is induced over the brain and nerves, which with drowſineſs and ſleep paſſes away like a drunken fit. The Youth amongſt them which drink Wine abhor Opium, until growing into years, and to the care of a family (as a ſign of which they ſuffer their beards to increaſe) they are taught by their Imaum, and more by example of others, that Wine being againſt their Law, is only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſable in wild and unbridled Youth, but in thoſe of riper age is a vice to be reproached by all ſober and well-governed men. In the place of which they take up the lawful and innocent Pill of Opium, which makes men ſerious and ſetled (as they ſay) becauſe that it operates not like Wine, which makes men mad, and raſh, and violent, but diſpoſes them to be Sots, and to ſit grave and quiet without doing hurt to any man, which is a qualification accounted very laudable amongſt them, and is one of the greateſt Vertues which they endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in their Tekeés or Monaſteries. This being the reaſon for which it is taken and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is grown a common cuſtom almoſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Country-people, who in the morning before they go to work take firſt their Opium, and upon it three or four diſhes of Coffee; for it is obſervable, that none eats Opium but who accompanies it with great quantities of Coffee, which is doubtleſs a kind of Opiate in it ſelf, and partakes very much of a Narcotick Quality; by this means and conſtant uſe ſome arrive to take ſtrange quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities; the moſt that ever I knew any man take was three drams in twenty four hours, <hi>viz.</hi> a dram and a half or thereabouts in the morning, and as much an hour afternoon: the which for more exactneſs I had the curioſity to ſee weighed. The ſame perſon offered for a ſmall reward to take five drams in twenty four hours; but then he ſaid, it required a long time to digeſt, and did not doubt but to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it: but I was too ſcrupulous to put a man into a ſleep, from whence I feared he might never awake. This perſon was of a thin and livid complexion, his skin ſhriveled, no more beard than a few hairs, his mouth commonly open, becauſe his chap was fallen; his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance putting me often in mind of the Picture I have ſeen of the <hi>Gorgons</hi> head; for had it been incompaſſed with Snakes inſtead of his Turbant, it might have ſerved for a perfect Original. He had arrived to the years of forty eight, and from the years thirty he had entred into Opium from great exceſs of Wine: in which condition he found that his ſtomach required littled other nouriſhment, being content with a ſmall quantity of bread and water for his other Diet, Opium ſupplying him with all the other Delicacies he could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: he was the father notwithſtanding of two or three children, which he confeſſed to have begot in the ſtrength of his Opium, having no deſire to accompany with his wife, until he was firſt invigorated with his uſual Doſe, being till then like a Trunk or Log, wanting ſpirits almoſt to turn his body. For his Opium was that only which could revive all, which about a quarter of an hour after it was taken began to operate, and then we diſcovered in his eyes, which before were dull and heavy, ſcarce opening, a certain quickneſs and ſparkling, and then ſoon after he was fitted for the work of the day, and could labour as others, and take a journey on foot of ſeven or eight miles to Market, and return home at night: his body was always bound, or his belly conſtipated with the hardneſs of his excrement, and yet he was ſubject to no other ſickneſs, unleſs his vitiated deſire to this Poyſon which can nouriſh no wholeſome or healthful body. The Turks, as I have learned, make little other uſe of Opium than this; yet ſometimes they will put it into their Camels ears, and the noſtrils of their Horſes, when faint and weary, wherewith they revive again, and ſoon recover their ſtrength and force to travel.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier having thus paſſed ſome days of Entertainment at <hi>Scio,</hi> entred again his Gally, and paſſing through the Streights of the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> arrived at <hi>Rodeſto,</hi> where having landed many of his Janiſaries and ſuch of the Army as remained with him, after a few days continuance he marched to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he was received by the Grand Signior with all evidences of ſatisfaction, and entred the City triumphant after the manner of the Turkiſh <hi>Allai.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Ceremonies and Complements being paſt, which uſually intervene between Great Perſonages after a long abſence, the grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation was, In what manner to prevent the ſeditious irruptions of the Souldiery, and how to reconcile the Jealouſies between the Grand Signior and his Brothers. For the former, two things were concluded neceſſary. Firſt, to divide the Militia of the Janiſaries, which was immediately executed, and eight thouſand of them, under pretence of Incurſions, were ſent through <hi>Moldavia</hi> to remain on the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Poland.</hi> Secondly, it being obſerved, that moſt of the Souldiery drank Wine, from whence in ancient times aroſe many Mutinies and Seditions of the Souldiery, dangerous to the Ottoman State, as namely in the time of <hi>Mahomet</hi> III. when the Janiſaries in the heat of drunkenneſs entred the Seraglio by force, and demanded the Heads of the chief Favourites: And as then it was judged the beſt Expedient to cool the hot brains of the Janiſaries, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a Prohibition of Wine at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to command upon pain of death, That thoſe who had any Wine in their Houſes ſhould bring it forth, and ſtave it; ſo now the uſe of it was univerſally forbidden in all the parts of the Grand Signiors Dominions, and a ſpecial Command was ſent to all places re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively under the penalty of death, and a thouſand maledictions, curſing Wine as come from Hell, and as a Liquor produced by the Devil to enſnare mens ſouls, and inebriate their heads, and confound States. And ſo generally was this Prohibition enjoyned, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Ambaſſador at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> with long ſolicitation and charge obtained licence for his Family, and the Merchants there to make Wine; but for the Merchants at <hi>Smyrna</hi> there was more difficulty, and this year Wine was not made in their Houſes according to cuſtom, and not without ſcruple permitted to be imported from the Greeks Iſlands, and other parts where the Command extended not its force; for the Prohibition was to all places where Moſchs or Turks Inhabitants, the Villages or Iſles where Chriſtians only lived were not included. To
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:39539:114"/>this Prohibition were added on every Friday Sermons to the People inveighing againſt Wine, and curſing the Drinkers of it, in which affair <hi>Vanni Efendi</hi> the Grand Signiors Preacher was much concerned, from whom the Original of this Counſel was judged to proceed. And now to pleaſe the Reader, who perhaps may be curious to know the ſtile of this Prohibition, I have here inſerted the Command <hi>verbatim</hi> as tranſlated out of the Original, and directed to the Kadi of <hi>Smyrna.</hi>

At Receipt of this my Royal Command know, That Wine and Games at Dice, and figured Cards, and of Arrows without feathers; which are Lotteries, are the filthineſs of Diabolical work (according to the teſtimony of the miraculous Revelation) are Fomenters of malice and wickedneſs, and are the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Faction and Sedition which corrupt and ſeduce the Servants of God, which being prohibited by Authority, and yet uſed, provokes the anger and diſdain of Almighty God againſt us: And whereas by this Mother of all wickedneſs (that is, Wine) the Muſulmin Kingdoms are defiled, there appears an evident alteration of the Muſulmin Law and Faith, and an inlet to actions of foul impreſſion.

And therefore you are to make known and publiſh to all Citizens and Inhabitants the force of this my Royal Command, as well in the City of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> as in other Cities and Towns ennobled with Muſulmin Moſchs, and you are to ruine the Taverns which are found there.

                     <p>THE Ship which carried the Preſents for the Turks and deſigned to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Ambaſſadour, being caſt away, new preparations were made, and the Gally <hi>Brazzana,</hi> commanded by <hi>Alexandro Zeno,</hi> a noble Venetian, was diſpatched with them, being ordered to tranſport Signior <hi>Molino</hi> the Ambaſſadour to the Port, who was received with the uſual honours due to his Quality and Character; all which Ceremonies and Offices being paſt, ſeveral matters occured which were not ſo well expreſſed in the Capitulations, but that they needed an explication; and new Orders and Models for redreſs of Affairs in <hi>Dalmatia:</hi> For the Morlacchs, who in the time of the War had ſubmitted themſelves to the obedience of the Venetians, began now to infeſt the Country, and to enter into thoſe places, which in the firſt years of the War they had deſtroyed and abandoned; the Turks on the other ſide oppoſed them, and the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open, many skirmiſhes happened, and as many troubles enſued as in the time of the War. For adjuſting theſe differences <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha of <hi>Boſna</hi> was diſpatched into thoſe Countries with Authority and Inſtructions; where on the other ſide he was met by <hi>Antonio Barbaro,</hi> Proveditor General of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> appointed by the Senate to accord and ſettle the differences of the Confines; and the place deſigned for meeting of the Commiſſioners was appointed to be between <hi>Climno</hi> and <hi>Cliſſa;</hi> but ſuch was the fury of the people, and the paſſion that both parties had to recover their ancient poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, that the Turks in the Month of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> by force of Armes made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Obronzo</hi> and <hi>Dernis,</hi> which were ſurrendred without much oppoſition, by reaſon of the ſmall numbers of the Morlacchs, who neither having Garriſon nor Fortifications were eaſily ſurprized, under the pretence of peace. But it ſucceeded otherwiſe at <hi>Scardona,</hi> where by the aſſiſtance of a Gally and ſome Brigantines, the Turks, who were the Aggreſſors, were repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and in like manner at <hi>Riſano</hi> they were beaten off, and put to flight with much confuſion and ſlaughter, with the death alſo of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſuff</hi> Bey, their chief Commander, and Author of all theſe troubles.</p>
                     <p>The Relation of theſe diſturbances was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Port by the Boſnacs, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe Affairs, with all circumſtances of aggravation which might incenſe the Grand Signior, and move the Vizier to take part in their Quarrel; But he being deſirous to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Peace which he himſelf had concluded, moved the Grand Signior to diſpatch a Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acheé, or one of his Royal Officers, to render him an exact account of the true ſtate of the Affairs of that Country. In which Interim <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> Paſha of <hi>Boſna,</hi> the Commiſſioner hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to dye, the Vizier moved, That the Morlacchs ſhould ſurrender up thoſe places which they had lately poſſeſſed, and that new Commiſſioners ſhould be again ſent for adjuſting the Limits of the Confines, and the Poſſeſſions of the Inhabitants. The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this propoſition, gave Orders to their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Barbaro</hi> to withdraw the people from the places in diſpute, and in the Month of <hi>May</hi> 1671. made and conſtituted the Cavalier <hi>Nani</hi> Procurator of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> their Plenipotentiary, with full authority to compoſe all differences touching the Frontiers. On part of the Turks one <hi>Mamut,</hi> once Paſha of <hi>Buda,</hi> and late Chima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was nominated and impowred with like faculty; he was a perſon with whom I was well acquainted, and of whom we have had occaſion to diſcourſe, when he was Kahya to old <hi>Kuperlee.</hi> He was a Native of the Country of <hi>Boſna,</hi> who are reputed for men of much more affable and courteous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and of more pleaſing Converſation, than the common temper of the Turks who are for the moſt part of haughty, ſullen, and ſatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Complexions.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Commiſſioners, with <hi>Thomas Tarſia</hi> Interpreter, met about the end of <hi>July,</hi> in the plains of <hi>Iſland</hi> between <hi>Zara</hi> and <hi>Sebenico</hi> under Tents erected for that purpoſe: At this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were preſent alſo the Mufti, and Treaſurer of <hi>Boſna,</hi> and all the Kadi's and Military Officers of that Province, which might make a Body of four or five thouſand men, ill armed, and badly accoutred: With <hi>Nani</hi> the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:39539:115"/>for <hi>Venice,</hi> were preſent, <hi>Alberto Magno</hi> Captain of <hi>Zara, Farſetti</hi> Proveditor of <hi>Cliſſa;</hi> divers military Officers, ſuch as the Cavalier <hi>Variſano, Grimaldi</hi> Serjeant General, Count <hi>Rados,</hi> the Count <hi>Scorto, Vimercato, Ceſarini,</hi> with divers other Colonels, and Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Nobles of the Province, ſome of which were Repreſentatives for their principal Cities, ſuch as <hi>Zara, Sebenico, Spalato,</hi> and <hi>Trau.</hi> His Excellency the Comiſſioner <hi>Nani</hi> had three Troops of Horſe, and as many Companies of Foot, for his Guard, and at <hi>Poſſidaria</hi> were two Gallies and four Brigantines to attend him: ſo that his Equipage appeared as well Martial, as agreeable to a place ordained for a Treaty of Peace.</p>
                     <p>On the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> the Commiſſioners had their firſt Conference in the Paſha's Tent, the Debate continued many hours with much heat; which did not only relate to the late Conqueſts, but new difficulties aroſe in regard that <hi>Ferat</hi> Aga, appointed Commiſſioner for the Port, had in the year 1573 aſſigned Bounds and Limits to the Confines, according to his pleaſure and arbitrary will, which not being aſſented unto by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, a new regulation was made by the ſaid <hi>Ferat,</hi> together with Cavalier <hi>Soranzo</hi> in the year 1576. Time afterwards, and the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirits of the Inhabitants had altered theſe Limits, and by reaſon of the long War the Land-Marks and Bounds of the Confines were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved or wholly deſtroyed. The original Copies of the Writings of Agreement were rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and much defaced, the names of the places and the ſcituations being wrote in divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, were confuſed, and the reports of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſo different, proceeding from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of their Intereſts, that little of judgment could be founded on their relations. At length, as to the Confines of <hi>Zara,</hi> it was agreed, That they ſhould be regulated according as they were limited by <hi>Soranzo</hi> and <hi>Ferat;</hi> for better ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of which, and to avoid all doubtfulneſs or miſtake, the Commiſſioners took the pains to travel ſeveral days journey in perſon to erect the bounds and Limits of each people; in which though many conteſts and differences aroſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween particular perſons, yet at length perſonal intereſts were forced to give way to publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the Confines of <hi>Sebenico</hi> were determined, being bounded by the River <hi>Checa,</hi> and being arrived at <hi>Scardona,</hi> the Paſha <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut</hi> deſired that he might have the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of paſſing in the Gally, and accordingly he was received aboard, and treated with that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous entertainment which is agreeable to the magnificence of the Republick; and landing at the River of <hi>Belulla</hi> on the Banks of the Vally <hi>Daniel,</hi> where the Paſha had placed his Tents, the Turks who with a greedy eye ſwallowed in their thoughts the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of all theſe Plains, would have enlarged their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines to thoſe marks which <hi>Ferat</hi> Aga had ſingly placed according to his own arbitrary pleaſure, including alſo <hi>Verpogly</hi> within their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.<note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about <hi>Verpogly.</hi>
                        </note> This <hi>Verpogly</hi> was a ſmall Redoubt on the top of a Hill once belonging to the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which at the begining of the War they abandoned, as coſting more to maintain and defend, than the value or conſideration of it; the Turks afterwards poſſeſſed it, when they had a deſign to beſiege <hi>Sebenico,</hi> but afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook it, and retired; upon this place <hi>Mamut</hi> much inſiſted, producing a Command from the Grand Signior, ordering that it be taken in, fortified, and garriſoned. But <hi>Nani</hi> with more force of Argument inſiſted on the contrary, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ancient Writings, and undeniable Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to prove that this place did really, and of right belong to the Republick; by which though the Paſha was fully convinced in his own mind; yet being over-awed by the inſolent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of the Inhabitants, he was cautious and fearful of declaring his true ſenſe in the caſe; but rather endeavoured to overcome the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians ſometimes with flatteries, and anon with menances, having to that purpoſe, beſides his own Forces, ordered the Beglerbey of <hi>Greece</hi> to approach thoſe Confines with an Army of about ten thouſand men. But all this did not move the ſteddy Conſtancy of the Venetian Commiſſioner from his reaſon and right; for maintenance of which he appeared firm and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and being neceſſitated for convenience of Water to remove his Quarters to the Lake <hi>Rebenich,</hi> gave ſome jealouſie to the Paſha by this retirement of an intention to break the Peace; howſoever, <hi>Nani</hi> declared his meaning to the contrary, and that there might be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption to their proceedings, propoſed that theſe differences might be remitted to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Powers; and that in the mean time, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til anſwers came, they might proceed in the adjuſtment of other parts of the Confines. But the Paſha aſſented not hereunto, but deſired rather the diſpute ſhould be referred to the Port, and that in the mean time he himſelf ſhould retire to <hi>Cettina,</hi> and the other to <hi>Spal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato.</hi> Scarce were the Meſſages ſent, and the Diſpatches made (by <hi>Iſaac</hi> Aga,<note place="margin">

And here it is admirable to obſerve with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and patience the Turkiſh Officers do uſually ſupport their laborious employments; they contemn all difficulties and incommodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of living, as if they did not feel them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uring themſelves to colds and hearts, to watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and labours, being abſtemious in their diet, and as occaſions require, not indulging to ſleep; and no queſtion but this aged man travelling in the ſcalding heat of the Sun, and ſuffering much for want of plenty, as well as of good water, dried up that little radical moiſture which remained, and cauſed this Autumn-fruit to fall, which perhaps might have continued a ſhort time longer on the tree, had it not been deſic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by drought, and ſhaken too hard by the motion of travels and labour.</p>
                     <p>The News of <hi>Mamut</hi> Paſha's death being arrived at the Port, a Commiſſion was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately granted to <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha Imbrahor, or Maſter of the Horſe to the Grand Signior, to ſucceed in his government and buſineſs of Treaty concerning the Limits of the Confines; with which Authority and Inſtructions <hi>Chuſaein</hi> poſted away, and being well informed by <hi>Iſaac</hi> Aga of the ill nature and rapacious diſpoſition of thoſe Borderers, arrived with intentions to agree, and with courteous and benign thoughts towards-Cavalier <hi>Nani,</hi> who had gained a great eſteem and repute amongſt the Turks of a generous and noble diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laying all conſiderations concerning the Limits aſſigned by <hi>Forat</hi> Aga,<note place="margin">A new Conference of the Com miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note> and the Conteſts about <hi>Verpoglie,</hi> the Line drawn from the Mountain <hi>Tartarus</hi> was agreed, and determined to be the true and undoubted Confines of <hi>Sebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico.</hi> The Valley of St. <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the pleaſure and fruitfulneſs of it, adminiſtred more of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but at length the Arguments of <hi>Nani</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and induced the Paſha to aſſent to thoſe Bounds, which had been aſſigned by <hi>Soranco</hi> in the year 1576. giving, to avoid future miſtakes, the true names to thoſe places, which the Turks for their advantage, and to confuſe things, had altered and diſguiſed, that they might not be known. Thence proceeding to the Teritory of <hi>Trau,</hi> where was leſs of difficulty or trouble; for the Wars not having made much alteration in that place, the Lines were evidently deſcribed by <hi>Soranco,</hi> according to whoſe deſcription the Fields, Plains, Rocks, and Mountains were mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out and, allowed.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, They came near to <hi>Spalato,</hi> where before the War there was little of any Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory aſſigned; but now by the Conqueſt of <hi>Cliſſa</hi> there was aſſigned unto it a ſpatious and fruitful Country, extending it ſelf to the foot of the Mountains. As to <hi>Cliſſa</hi> there was no difference at all: howſoever the Turks would on no means admit, that the Venetians ſhould keep <hi>Salona</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ragnizzo,</hi> becauſe by that they would cut off all communication between <hi>Cliſſa</hi> and <hi>Spalato,</hi> and thereby render it a place uſeleſs, and of more charge than benefit; and becauſe thoſe two places of <hi>Salona</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ragnizza</hi> had been the Dowry of a Sultana Wife of <hi>Ruſſen</hi> Paſha, and by her given to endow a Moſch, which therefore according to their Religion could not be given away, nor alienated. But <hi>Nani</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting as vigorouſly on this, as on other points, ſhewed himſelf reſolute to maintain this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, as being that, which if not granted, would certainly in a ſhort time be occaſion of thoſe quarrels and diſſentions, which muſt neceſſarily break forth into an open War: for that there could be no ſecurity of Peace to the Inhabitants of <hi>Salona,</hi> whilſt they lived amidſt their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and juſt on the Skirts of <hi>Cliſſa, Spalato,</hi> and <hi>Saſſo. Chuſaein</hi> having well comprehended this conſideration, and being deſirous to diſpoſe matters towards a durable Peace, ſlighted the opinion and ſenſe of the Borderers, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all matters, and in preſence of <hi>Nani</hi> ſubſcribed the Agreement on the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> in open Divan held in the Campagne of <hi>Salona;</hi> the which was alſo mutually ſubſcribed, and Copies interchangeably given. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the difference about the Confines was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the long War between <hi>Venice</hi> and the Turks had an end.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt all things were reducing themſelves into a poſture of Peace, the Timariots disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Janiſaries retired to their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in the month of <hi>October</hi> returned the Turks Envoyé from <hi>France,</hi> bringing with him an Ambaſſadour from that King called Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>De Nointel,</hi> a Perſon of an excellent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, grave and ſerious in his Treaties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; and to give this Embaſſy the greater reputation, he was attended with three Men of War and a Fire-ſhip, which ſailing along the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> and <hi>Propontick</hi> without oppoſition, came to an Anchor near ſeven Towers, from whence ſending advice of their arrival to the Chimacam demanded to be reſaluted by the Seraglio, they promiſing as they paſſed to ſhew the firſt demonſtrations of courteſie; but that being denied, as no uſual or cuſtomary, the French Ships paſſed the Seraglio ſilently without firing a Gun, or any ſignifications on either ſide, whether of Friendſhip of Hoſtility: the Ships came to an Anchor at <hi>Fonduclé,</hi> where the Ambaſſadour remained aboard unſaluted and unacknowledged by the publick Miniſters of the City; until the Great Vizier, who ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a breach with <hi>France</hi> ought to have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foundation than a meer Punctilio of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſeemed more to deſpiſe than take notice of the affront. For he who knew ſo well to diſſemble, after he had ſeen the French Troops ranged both in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> againſt the Ottoman Forces, and yet politickly connived thereat, and acepted an excuſe, did not eſteem it prudence to ground a War for want of the ſmoke of a few Guns; but on the contrary or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, That the Ambaſſadour ſhould be received with the uſual Form and Solemnity of Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The French having the advantage by this ſucceſs, the Souldiers and Sea-men belonging to the Ships committed many inſolencies in <hi>Pera</hi> and <hi>Calata,</hi> which never were revenged or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for; and when the Ships departed, above an hundred Slaves eſcaped from the Gallies and parts of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and gained Sanctuary aboard: amongſt the reſt one Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>De Beau-jeu</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> who had for a long time been Priſoner in the ſeven Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but at length knocking off his Irons, and by help of a Cord letting himſelf down from one of the higheſt Towers in the night, recovered the Ships, and regained his liberty. Nor yet did this nor other affronts, whereby the French did really brave the Turks, adminiſter ſufficient ſubject of choler to the Vizier; for paſſing all by, as if nothing had been done, or nothing worthy his notice, frankly gave his Orders to let the Ships paſs the Caſtles, which upon the foregoing cauſes and pretences had been before detained: adding, That it was natural, as well for men as for birds, to endeavour to procure their liberty, and therefore were not blameable but that thoſe to whoſe care they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, wanting due circumſpection and vigilance in their Office, ſhould pay for the eſcape of their charge by the price of their own lives or liberties.</p>
                     <p>The French Ambaſſadour in the mean time proceeded in his Journey to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where the Court reſided; and having paſſed through the ſeveral degrees and Punctilio's of Viſits and other Ceremonies, at length deſcending to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of buſineſs, propoſed the renovation of the Articles of Peace, with an addition of thirty two Particulars to be altered or adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Vizier who all this time kept more in his heart than he evidenced in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, refuſed to condeſcend to a conceſſion of the moſt eaſie and reaſonable of their demands, offering only to renew the Capitulations <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> according to the Tenour of the ancient Cannon, without other alteration than the Name of the preſent Sultan, and the Date of the Month and Year, and herein he was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and fixed, that no arguments or colours of reaſon could ſeem to move him in the moſt minute and leſs important points of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and this perhaps leſt the World
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:39539:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhould imagine, that the Turks were affrighted into Terms and better Treatments of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or that Immunities and Privileges in the Ottoman Court were acquired rather by rude uſage adjoyned with menaces and neglects, than by more candid and fawning Addreſſes.</p>
                     <p>In this manner the French Affairs rather went back than forwards in the Ottoman Court, and it ſeemed that the Turks late Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy into <hi>France</hi> and of the French to the Port ſerved to augment the differences more than allay them. For the new Ambaſſador falling ſhort in his expectation, having obtained nothing of thoſe many Particulars which he demanded, retired male-content from <hi>Adria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> to his uſual Reſidence at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where he reſolved to attend what farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions ſhould be given him from <hi>France;</hi> and ſuppoſing his Maſter would ill reſent his uſage ſo contrary to what was promiſed in general terms, did ſuppoſe, that his next Orders would be of revocation, and that thoſe frequent diſguſts and diſreſpects ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and given on one ſide and the other, would at length burſt out into an open defiance. The Turks apprehended ſo much themſelves, and as their affairs and deſigns proved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with <hi>Poland,</hi> they were diſpleaſed that they had given the moſt Chriſtian King ſo juſt an occaſion of quarrel: for underſtanding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the latter end of the Year 1671. that great Preparations for War were making in <hi>France</hi> both by Sea and Land, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that their demerits had juſtly deſerved the chaſtiſement of the French Arms, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the many injuries they had offered that Nation, and therefore pauſed a while, and obſerved the motion of theſe Enemies, before they would engage themſelves in a War with <hi>Poland.</hi> But at length the beginning of the Year 1672. having diſcovered the deſigns of <hi>France</hi> to be only intended againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> the Turks reaſſumed their purpoſes ſo long premeditated againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> with an arrogance natural to Turks, and with a ſcorn not only of <hi>France,</hi> but of all Chriſtendom. For his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty judging perhaps, that the rude treatment of an Infidel Prince ſo far remote, intrenched not ſo much on his Honour and Intereſt, as the quarrel he had with the neighbouring States, ſeemed to contemn for the preſent, or rather to defer the revenge of former injuries until a more fit and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſeaſon; wherefore in the mean time his Ambaſſador upon new Inſtructions from <hi>France</hi> brought purpoſely by a Man of War, repaired a ſecond time to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> where he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated unto the chief Miniſters the great deſire his Maſter had to maintain that League and Friendſhip, which for above an hundred years had continued inviolate and uninterrutped: and therefore waving all other former Particulars of demand, declared himſelf ſatisfied, only to renew the Capitulations, with that ſingle altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Cuſtoms from five to three in the hundred, according to that Priviledge which the Engliſh and all other Chriſtian Merchants enjoyed, whoſe League and Friendſhip was ſubſequent to that of others. The Great Vizier being now freed of that ſuſpicion and fear he apprehended of the French Fleet, and being aſſured that their Arms were not now probable to diſturb him in his deſigns intended, he ſeriouſly ſmiled in his ſleeve at theſe Addreſſes, and with a kind of ſcorning neglect bid the Ambaſſador welcome to the Court, ſaying, That he ſhould have what he deſired. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Capitulations were tranſcribed, and the alteration made in the value of their Cuſtoms; but the Vizier who meant nothing leſs than to yield them this Priviledge, defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſigning thereof from day to day, paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the daily importunity of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor with dilatory excuſes, until at length having protracted the time to the very day that the Grand Signior and he began their March towards <hi>Poland,</hi> without ſo much as granting the Ambaſſador a perſonal Audience, did then with ſoft and gentle words ſignifie to the Interpreters the grand preſſures of his Affairs at preſent, that would not permit him time to perfect all matters with the Ambaſſadour, whom they ſhould aſſure, that at his return with Glory and Victory from the Enterprizes in hand, thoſe requeſts ſhould be granted, and his promiſes performed; and in the mean time his Nation ſhould remain ſecure in theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, as in former times, and the League and Friendſhip continued and maintained. The Ambaſſador was ſtrangely ſurpriſed at this laſt Farewel; but being a Gentleman of great Morality and Vertue, knew, no doubt, how to bear ſuch a diſappointment with an equality of mind agreeable to the greatneſs of his Soul; and therefore with a due reſentment of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury received, he returned to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whilſt the Sultan and his Vizier proceeded in their March towards the Confines of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But before I enter into a relation of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that War, and the ſucceſs thereof, which is the Subject of the following Year, let us return to the place from whence we have digreſſed, and obſerve in this Year of Peace and repoſe of this Empire, what the Sultan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived for ſecurity of himſelf by the death of his Brothers.</p>
                     <p>We acquainted you formerly in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Sultan was diſappointed in his deſigns againſt his Brothers, by means of his Mother, to whom the Janiſaries had committed the care of their ſafety, which ſhe according to her promiſe had maintained, and tendered equally with her own. But now the Vizier being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the Wars, and the moſt ſeditious amongſt the Janiſaries withdrawn from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> it was thought fit to make a new attempt on the Princes ſtill reſiding in the old Seraglio, which was performed with thoſe duc preparations and ſecrecy, that it took effect on Sultan <hi>Orchan,</hi> the eldeſt of the two, who in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> 1671.<note place="margin">Sultan <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan</hi> put to death by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> dyed by a draught of poyſon, which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred to him as a Preſent from his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Brother; ſome ſay he was ſtrangled, and that before he ſubmitted his neck to the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, he killed one of the Executioners with his Hanjarre. This Prince was reported by the people to be a comely Perſon, of a ſtrong and robuſtious body, of large and black eyes like Sultan <hi>Morat:</hi> his death was lamented by all, and preſaged as fatal to the Empire, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that that very night that he was murthered the Moon ſuffered a greater Eclipſe than it had done for many years before, which happening out in this conjuncture was interpreted as omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and ſerved to increaſe the maledictions and evil ſpeeches, which the Turks in all places
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:39539:117"/>caſt out upon thoſe who gave this counſel to the Sultan.</p>
                     <p>About this time the State of <hi>Genoua</hi> deſirous to change their Officers in <hi>Turkie,</hi> ſent a new Reſident to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ſent from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua.</hi>
                        </note> and a Conſul to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> which change was prinicipally obtained at the requeſt of the old Miniſters, who weary of an employment ſo tedious, without a benefit correſponding to their melancholy life, and perceiving their Trade decline before it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to any tolerable ſtate or degree of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the aſſiſtance and mediation of friends ſollicited their Letters of Revocation. For the Trade of <hi>Genoua</hi> being cheifly founded on hopes of thoſe advantages which they expected from a coarſe or baſe alloy of mony, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly decay ſo ſoon as the Turks diſcovered themſelves to be abuſed by the vaſt quantities of Temins imported, as we have before related: after which their profit failing, the Conſulage conſequently decayed, which is the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence and encouragement of ſuch Officers as are neceſſary to reſide for the continuance of that Peace, which but a few years before they unadviſedly made with the Turk. The new Reſident had no ſooner arrived at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and conſidered the poor and mean eſtate and ill foundation of their Trade, the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charge of the Reſidency, and the great debts thereof that were to devolve upon him from his Predeceſſor; but he perceived into what a Labyrinth of troubles he had ingulfed himſelf, inſtead of being preferred according to his hopes into a place of Honour and happy retirement. In which confuſion of thoughts ariſing one morning before day from his bed, and ſitting on his Cloſe-ſtool (as the ſervants of the houſe report) reached at a Towel, which being intangled within the Lock of a Carbine that hanged always charged near his bed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately drew the Trigger too hard, which with that gave fire, and ſhot the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man into the belly with a brace of Bullets, of which being mortally wounded, after Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and ſome Prayers in a few hours he paſſed to another life: unhappy miſchance, if it may be called a chance; for I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood from a ſober perſon of that Nation, that the anguiſh of mind which he conceived at the evil condition of his Affairs, wrought in him a deepneſs of melancholy and deſpair, under which languiſhing ſome days, did at laſt moſt miſerably lay violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                     <p>And now it is time to recal to mind the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of Count <hi>Serini,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of <hi>Serini, Frangi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pani,</hi> and <hi>Nadaſti.</hi>
                        </note> Marqueſs <hi>Frangipani,</hi> and Count <hi>Nadaſti,</hi> Perſons of Quality and of great Power in <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> who (as we ſaid before) had ſent their Meſſengers to the Great Vizier then remaining in the Leagure of <hi>Candia,</hi> with overtures of ſubmiſſion to the Ottoman Power. It was ſtrange News to the World to hear that the Houſe of <hi>Serini</hi> ſhould abandon the Chriſtian Party, and thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Defenders of their Country ſhould apoſtatize, though not from Chriſtianity, yet from that Cauſe and Liberty which their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors and themſelves had defended with Blood, Treaſure, Valour, and Conſtancy. But diſſentions and animoſities ſown by Satan, the Enemy of the Chriſtian Church, did ſtrangely corrupt the minds of thoſe famous Perſons, and raiſe in them a Spirit reſolved to avenge the neglect and injuries put upon them by the Miniſters of the Imperial Court, though at the expence and hazard of their fortunes and lives, and ruine and ſhiprack of their Honour and Conſciences: For the neglects and affronts undeſervedly caſt on <hi>Nicholas Serini</hi> during the late War (as before related) and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and ſcorn put on the Croatian and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian Nobility, was ſuppoſed to have fired the hot and ambitious Spirit of theſe Perſons, who could more eaſily endure the ſlavery of the Turkiſh yoke, than condeſcend to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and prevalency of a contrary Party. Wherefore in proſecution of their deſign, the complices of <hi>Serini</hi> being reſolved to ſubmit to the Turk, diſpatched two other Gentlemen to the Ottoman Court (beſides thoſe which were ſent the year before to <hi>Salonica</hi>) who arrived at <hi>Adrianople</hi> the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1670/1 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the protection of the Sultan, for which they promiſed a Tribute of thirty Purſes, or fifteen thouſand Dollars every year for thoſe Lands they held in <hi>Croatia.</hi> To make Anſwer hereunto a Divan or Council was called, in which were weighed all the Arguments and Reaſons on one ſide and the other. The Muftee oppoſed their receiving into protection, as being againſt the Capitulations and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo lately concluded with the Emperor, wherein the receiving or abetting of Rebels is expreſly forbidden, and provided againſt by one ſide and the other; but <hi>Vanni Efendi</hi> the Preacher who uſed to be always of a different opinion to the Muftee, urged to have them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becauſe that the advancement of the Mahometan Cauſe, and enlargement of their Empire was more ſacred than the conſervation of their League with an Infidel Prince. And that the Ottoman Court was no longer to be termed the Refuge of the World, if it could not yield that protection which oppreſſed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and diſtreſſed Princes petitioned to obtain. In this manner the matter being controverted without Agreement, it was in fine reſolved to refer the matter to the determination of the Grand Vizier, who was now a few months paſt return'd triumphant from <hi>Candia.</hi> But by this time Intelligence being come by way of <hi>Boſna,</hi> that the Emperor had already entered <hi>Croatia</hi> with thirty thouſand men, that he had taken <hi>Chiacheturno</hi> in <hi>Cotoriba,</hi> and that <hi>Serini</hi> and his Aſſociates were taken already or fled, either to <hi>Vienna</hi> to beg pardon of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, or <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> or to ſome other place, that the Marqueſs of <hi>Bada</hi> had fortified <hi>Sequas</hi> and other Caſtles of <hi>Serini</hi> with German Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons; the Turks eſteemed it too late to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter help to this deſperate cauſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſed to own the Partronage of a People, to whom they could neither pretend by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor defend by Arms. The Vizier alſo like the Fox, contemned thoſe Grapes which he could not reach, and with an abhorrency as it were of the Revolt or the Rebellion, as a zealous Hater of all perfidiouſneſs, refuſed to afford protection to any of the Complices in the late Confederacy, which he politickly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned in reference to the Emperor, whoſe friendſhip he would ſeem to conſerve moſt faithfully, leſt he ſhould interrupt him in the carrying on of that War, which he then medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt <hi>Poland.</hi> But what became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of theſe Conſpirators is the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the German Hiſtory, it is ſufficient to acquaint the Reader here that their deſign be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:39539:117"/>ſeaſonably diſcovered, they were interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the hand of Juſtice, and met that Fate which is due to Traitors and Rebels to their Country, having abuſed the goodneſs of their Prince, to whom clemency and mercy are connatural. We ſhall therefore leave theſe men to render the next account to the Judge of all things, and proſecute our Relation of the Wars of <hi>Poland,</hi> which now was the next prize held up to the Turkiſh Militia, and was that adventure which was to conſummate the glories of the Great Vizier. Howſoever, this gave beginning to that Rebellion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which to this Year 1679 hath been continued, without proſpect how far it may proceed, and what may be the iſſue of ſuch direful Effects.</p>

                     <p>WE have formerly acquainted you how coarſely the Chimacam of <hi>Adrianople</hi> had in the year 1667 treated the Ambaſſador of <hi>Poland,</hi> who came to complain of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions made into their Country by the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars; deſiring that not only ſatisfaction might be made for the late ſpoils, but that that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and ſavage people might be reſtrained from the like Attempt for the future. But the Vizier being now returned in perſon it was thought neceſſary, That to preſerve this groſs Body of Empire from corruption, it ſhould be exerciſed with motion, and the vigorous agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a new War.<note place="margin">The Turks deliberate of a War.</note> To what place they ſhould now convert or employ their Arms, was the important ſubject of a grand Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; they had lately made up a peace with the Venetians, ſo that on that ſide it was too early to make an irruption, the parts of <hi>Perſia</hi> were too remote and diſtant to carry on a War with ſucceſs and pleaſure; the fields of <hi>Hungary</hi> had been lately traced, and they were ſatiated with the blood of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Germany;</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now of novelty muſt be propoſed, and the forgotten ways of <hi>Poland</hi> muſt be again opened, there being ſomething, it ſeems, of wantonneſs in proſperous Arms, which delight in variety, and abhor as much to fight often in the ſame Country, as Travellers do to ſee the ſame place twice. The Polanders had unto this day ſo preſerved the Limits of their Country with honour and gallantry, that the Turks could never ſecure to themſelves one palm of Land within their Territories, until the civil and moſt deteſtable Diſcords of that Country laid them open to the fury of their Enemies, who embraced this moſt grateful op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, which facilitated their Deſign, and made that eaſie which they had ſo long deſired, and with care ſtudied and contrived. But for the better underſtanding of theſe Affairs it is convenient for us to take the Thread of Hiſtory at ſome diſtance off, that ſo we may with better light comprehend the Cauſes, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, and Occaſions of this War.</p>
                     <p>The hatred and jealouſies which the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Port hath always nouriſhed and conſerved againſt the Kingdom and Dominions of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are ancient and inveterate, having their riſe from the valiant oppoſition and ſucceſsful repulſes it always made againſt the various attempts of the Turks; whereby the Poles were animated to treat always at equals with them, and with terms agreeable to that vain glory and ſwelling pride, which are natural to their Nation.<note place="margin">The Cauſes of the War with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> But that which renewed the memory of paſt actions, and raiſed an expectation in the Turks to avenge the injuries by ſubjugating the Coſacks, was one <hi>Bogdan Chimilniczki</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Coſacks, who growing powerful in that Country, with the ſtrength of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Army, abhorring the Pride of the Poliſh Nobility, denied obedience to their Kingdom, reſolving to make himſelf the abſolute Prince of that Province, from whence various fortunes of War ſucceeding, he was at length forced to join himſelf to the Tartars, and crave the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Turkiſh Arms. In the mean time, <hi>Poland,</hi> invaded by the Swedes, Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and Tranſilvanians, was diſmembred of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Lituania</hi> and <hi>Verania,</hi> the firſt poſſeſſed by the Swedes, and the latter by the Czar of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> and the Rebel Coſacks; which confuſions rejoyced the Turks, and gave them the firſt hopes, not only to free themſelves from the frequent Piracies the Coſacks committed on them in the Black Sea, but to impoſe upon them the Ottoman Yoke; to which end they maintained a ſecret correſpondence with the Generals of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, promiſing them the aſſiſtance of Men, Mony, and Arms, but yet with that caution, that they would not ſeem unprovoked to quarrel with the Poles, or without juſt cauſe to violate the peace of <hi>Choccin,</hi> to which they pretended a moſt religious and reverend regard.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, that they might not appear cauſeleſs Actors againſt that ſolemn League, they ſecretly encouraged thoſe Incurſions, which in the Years 1666 and 1667 we have already mentioned to have been made by the Tartars into <hi>Poland,</hi> as far as the Walls of <hi>Leopolis;</hi> which action, that the Tartars might not have occaſion to abett and maintain, the Poles reſolved to ſend a moſt ſplendid Embaſſy to the Turks, deſiring that the Tartar <hi>Han</hi> might be depoſed, for having unjuſtly violated the ſacred peace of <hi>Choccin.</hi> For that as the Poles were obliged to reſtrain the Piracies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of the Coſacks in the Black Sea, ſo the Turks were become ſecurity againſt the incurſions of the Tartars. Scarce had the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador <hi>Radiowski</hi> delivered this meſſage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he unhappily died at <hi>Adrianople</hi> (as we have before ſignified;) to whoſe Complaint and Demand, after many delays, no other anſwer was given, than that the Poles ſhould firſt break their League which they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with <hi>Moſcovy</hi> for thirteen years, without the conſent, and againſt the pleaſure of the Port, and then after that they might expect and promiſe themſelves all due ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                     <p>In this manner Affairs ſtood when King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> weary of the Factions and Diſcords of the Nobility, reſigned up his Crown to retire unto a private life. And now it being neceſſary to proceed to a new Election we may conſequently expect various Commotions and Diſturbances in this State, ſufficient to artract the eyes of the Turks, and encourage the Coſacks in their intended Revolt. At length Prince <hi>Michael Korebut Wiſnowieski</hi> being elected King, it ſeemed agreeable to reaſon, that all <hi>Verania</hi> ſhould have returned to obedience of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:39539:118"/>him, to whom the beſt part of that Country did by right of patrimony, and natural inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance belong; but the ſucceſs thereof fell out contrary to all expectation, for <hi>Doroſensko,</hi> then General, deſigning to uſurp that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, propoſed the project of uniting <hi>Verania</hi> to the Body of <hi>Poland,</hi> as a member of the Crown, by which means that Province would not only become free from its Vaſſalage to the Nobility, but obtain equal ſuffrages in the Diet, with all the other more free and priviledged Countries; and in this manner he might not only compel <hi>Poland</hi> to condeſcend to his deſigns, but confirm himſelf in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſupreme Authority of the Coſacks: This propoſition therefore ſeemed ſo inſolent, and favouring of Rebellion to the Poliſh Court, that a ſevere and menacing Meſſage was diſpatched to <hi>Doroſensko,</hi> threatning to take from him his Bulaua, or Truncheon of General, if ever he entertained any ſuch ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination ſo highly derogatory to the Majeſty of the Poliſh State; he therefore thought it his time to caſt himſelf wholly into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Sultan, and accordingly diſpatch'd Ambaſſadors to the Port to ſignifie their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, begging to be received into the Arms of the Ottoman Power; and as an aſſurance thereof, that he might receive the (Tough) which is the Enſign of Authority, carried by Paſhaws. The Vizier at the firſt motion hereof, reflecting on the evil conſequences, in caſe the Grand Signior's honour ſhould be foiled in this action, ſuſpended a while a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat anſwer thereunto; but at length being inſtantly ſollicited, and perceiving the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and Factions of <hi>Poland</hi> to encreaſe, the Coſacks were received for Subjects of the Empire, and obliged to wage War againſt all Enemies to the Ottoman Power.</p>
                     <p>Duke <hi>Michael</hi> being elected King, the firſt Act he performed was to ſend an Ambaſſador extraordinary to the Grand Signior, with no other Deſign than to acquaint him of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Crown, only in caſe an opportunity preſented, then to move for a ratification of the Articles concluded at <hi>Choccin.</hi> This Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, called <hi>Wiſozki,</hi> being of a haughty and proud ſpirit, became the Author of all the miſchief which enſued; for being of a temper which could not equally bear the honour of his important Office, lanched out into matters beyond his Commiſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of imparting his Meſſage, would become ſole Arbitrator of all the differences between thoſe two powerful Princes; for he being unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Power or Affairs of the Turks, ſuppoſed nothing in this World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the number, riches, and valour of his own Nation, and therefore gave himſelf that liberty of arrogant Language, that by way of Command and Menaces he rather ſeemed to act the part of a Governor or Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the differences of State, than of an Orator or Suppliant for peace. In his conceit the Turks wanted both courage and power to invade <hi>Poland,</hi> and therefore ſuppoſed he might ſafely brave them into a ratification of former Articles, eſpecially when he mentioned a hundred thouſand Horſe, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took before the Vizier to be able on his own account to conduct as far as the Walls of <hi>Adrianople.</hi> It was a ſtrange humor of <hi>Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montado</hi> that inſpired theſe two laſt Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and if from them we may take a pattern of the diſpoſition of the reſt of the Poliſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it will be no wonder to hear and read the Deſtractions that are amongſt them, that they carry themſelves with diſreſpect to their Prince, are emulous and factious amongſt themſelves, and that their pride and ignorance, which have flattered their humour, and triumphed amidſt their Tenants and Vaſſals, ſhould betray them to all thoſe evils which we may fear may be the conſequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                     <p>The Great Vizier, conſidering the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which this perſon uſed in his Diſcourſe, imagined that the differences in his Country might be compoſed, and therefore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with his deſire, offered in general terms to confirm the peace made at <hi>Choccin,</hi> without Addition of any new Article in reference to the Coſacks, being a buſineſs of that nature which admitted of no preſent determination; this, he ſaid, was his ultimate reſolution, which if the Ambaſſadour approved not, he might then adviſe it home, and expect a farther reſult of their Counſels. <hi>Wiſozki</hi> being really poſſeſſed in his fancy of the Turks weakneſs, gave way to his paſſion, and with little judgment replied, That he approved not of the Propoſition, nor needed he to tranſmit any ſuch advice into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he himſelf being a Plenipotentiary of as full a Power as the King and Council; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nobleman, he was by conſequence that neceſſary Member of the Republick, that nothing could paſs without his Suffrage.</p>
                     <p>The Vizier amazed at this extravagant way of diſcourſe, the which he ſupported with moderation and contempt, diſpatched away a Chiaus into <hi>Poland</hi> with Letters, deſiring that this Ambaſſadour ſhould be recalled, as being a Perſon unable to manage matters of the leaſt concernment; and if they ſupplied his place with an other, he ſhould be received with due reſpect, and a plain way laid open to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his Negotiations to the ſatisfaction of both Parties.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Wiſozki</hi> abounding in his own ſenſe and humor, repreſented matters in a far different manner into <hi>Poland,</hi> alledging, That the Law of Nations was impeached by the violence offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Perſon, being impriſoned, and the uſual Tain or Allowance of Ambaſſadours withheld from him; both which were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely true: for the maintenance he refuſed as too mean for his Quality and Office; and for his Impriſonment, it was no other than Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement to the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with a prohibition only from paſſing over unto <hi>Pera,</hi> where formerly in a houſe he had taken, he committed a thouſand irregularities and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which cauſed the Vizier to recal him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain over to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> denying him the liberty of paſſing more to the other ſide. Theſe were the injuries which he complained of into <hi>Poland,</hi> ſtill fancying, That if the Nobility were aſſembled to conſider of theſe matters, the Turk would be ſo affrighted at it as to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend unto any terms he ſhould propound. Theſe reports of <hi>Wiſozki</hi> took that impreſſion with the Court, that eſteeming all authentick which he ſaid or wrote, without farther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation iſſued out Orders for a general Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that all people ſhould prepare for the War, rendring the Vizier no other anſwer, than that when their Ambaſſadour was ſet at liberty,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:39539:118"/>and had licence to depart, the like ſhould be permitted unto theirs, and in the mean time the Chiaus was committed to ſafe cuſtody, The Grand Signior highly angred at this obſtinate miſunderſtanding, immediately ordered that <hi>Wiſozki</hi> ſhould depart, and at the ſame time commanded his whole Militia to riſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him to the War; and ſo much the rather was he animated by the reports ſent him from <hi>Doroſenzko,</hi> ſeconded by the Vayvods of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia</hi> and <hi>Valachia,</hi> whoſe Letters declared the miſerable confuſions in <hi>Poland</hi> divided into divers Factions and Parties, their want of money, and the mutiny of the Souldiery inclined rather to betray than defend <hi>Verania.</hi> And now a Sword and other Preſents uſual in theſe caſes, being ſent to the Tartar <hi>Han,</hi> he was ordered to unite with the Coſſacks, and to invade <hi>Poland,</hi> where being encountred near <hi>Batona,</hi> by a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Horſe under the Command of <hi>Luzecki</hi> Governour of <hi>Podolia,</hi> the Poles were defeated, and was the firſt bad Omen of the ill ſucceſs of this unhappy War.</p>
                     <p>To ſecond theſe beginnings, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior having raiſed an Army of an hundred and fifty thouſand men, marched towards <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> already ſick and languiſhing with its own inteſtine diſtempers, and unable to contend with a Body united within it ſelf, wanting nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther internal vigour, nor nouriſhment to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its ſtrength; the firſt Enterpriſe was the impregnable Fortreſs of <hi>Caminiecz,</hi> which had often in former times baffled the Ottoman Arms; but now being ill provided, deſtitute of Arms, Ammunition, Proviſions, and but weakly manned, and what was worſt, deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any Relief, after eleven days Siege ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred it ſelf to the pleaſure of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Hence the Turks had an open paſſage through all <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Volhinia</hi> to the very Walls of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> which they paſſed over like Travellers rather than Enemies, there not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing one perſon in Arms to oppoſe them, delighting and ſporting themſelves in theſe moſt fruitful and delicious Countries of <hi>Europe:</hi> thus had private animoſities and civil rancour poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the minds of the Poles one agaisnſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they had rather yield themſelves to the ſervitude of an Enemy, than condeſcend to the humor or counſel of a Citizen. Thus had the Turks paſſed all this Summer in the Plains and Cities of <hi>Poland,</hi> where it ſeemed rather Peace than War, all places ſubmitting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out difficulty unto the Grand Signior as to their true and natural Lord and Soveragin, by which means the Inhabitants redeemed their Lives and Eſtates; for the Sultan willing to demonſtrate his clemency, and to ſpare thoſe who volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily yielded, and encourage others to ſubmit to ſo gentle a yoke, forbad all the common out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages of Souldiers, not permitting Plunder or Booty to be brought into the Camp; nor grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Spoils to be committed, than if his Army had paſſed through his own Dominions; whether this obliging or winning manner of proceedings overcame the ſtout hearts of the Polanders more than blows, will be experienced in the ſequel of this ſtory; it is certain the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia returned home poor and weary, and more broken by this years Expedition than by the long and tedious March to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Battles during the Siege of <hi>Babylon;</hi> but the Sultan was deſirous to return home, and give this firſt proof and teſtimony to the World of his war-like and invincible Spirit, of his clemency and of his ſucceſs in Arms, that at his firſt appearing in the Field, all Armies and Fortreſſes ſubmitted to his Power. The Poles on the other ſide being of an opinion and temper far different to that of their Ambaſadour <hi>Wiſozki,</hi> reſolved to purchaſe the departure of their new Gueſts on any terms; ſo that theſe following Articles were agreed and conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould quit all Claim to <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain, Podolia,</hi> and <hi>Ruſland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That for <hi>Leopolis</hi> and the Country thereabouts ſhould be paid a Tribute of ſeventy thouſand Dollars a year; all other Capitulations for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made were to ſtand in force and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Articles being ſigned, the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior committed the Government of <hi>Verama</hi> and <hi>Podolia</hi> to <hi>Doroſenzko,</hi> and the defence of <hi>Caminiecz</hi> to <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha with a Garriſon of twelve thouſand Janiſaries; ſo that now being returned home, the Militia was permitted to repair to their ſeveral Countries and Dwellings, the following year being dedicated to the repoſe and eaſe of the Souldiery.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of this Year, when the Ships of <hi>Barbary</hi> returned home, thoſe of <hi>Tripoli</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a certain diſcontent againſt their Paſha named <hi>Oſman</hi> for his covetous behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Souldiers; for having that Summer taken very rich Prizes from the Venetians and other Nations, the Souldiers expected at their return home to receive a diviſion of their Spoils according to their juſt and equal ſhares. But the Paſha grown old and covetous, getting the whole into his hand, appropriated the greateſt part to his own Coffers, diſtributing to the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers an inconſiderable proportion of what they had gained the year before. Hereupon the chiefeſt Commanders amongſt them becoming greatly enraged began to incenſe the Souldiery, which for intereſt or want of Pay, being always ready to mutiny, took fire immediately, and eaſily were blown into a Rebellion; ſo that firſt making Parties, and retiring into ſecret Junto's and Councils, they reſolved to deſtroy the Paſha, and alter the Government, and thereby make themſelves Maſters of all the Treaſure and Riches which <hi>Oſman</hi> Paſha had in the ſpace of thirty years amaſſed together. The Paſha having notice of all that paſſed, and apprehending the Conſpiracies of this unbridled People to be dangerous, began to provide for his ſafety, and getting together ſo many as he ſuppoſed of his Party, and that were, or might be faithful to him, which joyned with his Slaves and Servants, made up a ſmall Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, wherewith to defend and preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf within his Caſtle, which being well provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Ammunition and Victuals, he ſhut his Gates, denying acceſs or admittance unto all perſons upon pretence and account whatſoever. Hereupon the Mutiny appearing, the Souldiery drew into a Body in the open field, againſt whom ſeveral ſhot were made from the Caſtle; ſo that now the Civil War was begun, and the whole Force of <hi>Tripoli</hi> raiſed againſt the Paſha and his Caſtle, which being ſtraitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged the Defendants who were for the moſt part Servants and Slaves, failing in their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, reſolved to make Conditions for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the beſt advantage; wherefore conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt their Maſter, entred his Chamber
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:39539:119"/>and ſtrangled him in the night; and the next morning opening the Caſtle-gates, received the Enemy within the Walls, making manifeſt the death of their Maſter and their own Treachery. <hi>Oſman</hi> Paſha being dead, every one acted for a time what the wildneſs of an unruly multitude could ſuggeſt, till ſuch time as the Heads of the Rebellion could frame themſelves into ſome form of Government, which for the preſent was reſolved to be by a <hi>Dei,</hi> as moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for commanding of the Souldiery, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending for the future to take the <hi>Algier</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a Divan for their Pattern and Model of Rule, under which the people of that place had found and experienced the ſweetneſs of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, riches, and ſucceſs. Theſe matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed upon, ſome of their Men of War were ſent to give advice unto the Grand Signior of the revolutions of their City, ſupplicating him to pardon the violence uſed againſt their Paſha <hi>Oſman,</hi> whoſe Covetouſneſs and Tyranny forced them for ſelf-preſervation to precipitate that Authority, which they knew on their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, his Majeſty would have granted them; and that he would be pleaſed to receive them into his protection and favour, as his faithful and humble Subjects and Slaves, and as an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thereof would grant them a Paſha confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Royal Signature. The Sultan, though at firſt ſhewed himſelf much diſpleaſed with this manner of proceeding againſt <hi>Oſman</hi> Paſha; yet ſeeing that there was no remedy, ſuffered himſelf to be mollified by their Preſents and ſubmiſſion, granting them a Paſha for their Governour, whoſe power proved as unſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant as his doth, who bears that Title at <hi>Algier.</hi> Matters being thus reduced to ſome tolerable condition amongſt them, they concluded, That the moſt beneficial courſe of life to render them conſiderable, as well as to amuſe and divert the minds of their rude people from innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt their Governours, was to grant free liberty to whomſoever pleaſed to arm out Ships of War; which Priviledge <hi>Oſman</hi> Paſha reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to himſelf and his Confidents; and finding at preſent that they were able to ſet out ſix Sail from forty to fifty Guns, and four more from twelve to thirty, intending to accompliſh in all the full number of fifteen Sail; thoſe who trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Levant Seas began to apprehend, that this faithleſs and heady people would at a time, when they found their advantage and the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a rich Prize, break their Peace with his Majeſty our King, the which <hi>Oſman</hi> Paſha had notwithſtanding conſerved for ſeveral years without violation, moved perhaps thereunto out of an apprehenſion, that in ſuch troubles which a War with <hi>England</hi> might bring upon them, he might loſe or impair his riches, and bring the like confuſion on his people, as he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard of in <hi>Algier</hi> on the like occaſion: but how and in what manner theſe matters ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and how at length this people broke their Peace and Faith, we reſerve to be recounted at the end of the Year 1674.</p>
                     <p>Towards the end of the month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> it pleaſed God to take out of this life unto a better Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſadour at <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> a man whoſe perſon being comely, was extremely grateful to the Turks; and for the experience he had at the Ottoman Court, was equal in the happy management of Affairs to any of his Predeceſſours.</p>

                     <p>BUT it ſeems the Turks had made too much haſte in their return to digeſt a Conqueſt of ſo large Extent; ſo that they were ſcarce well warmed by their Winter-fires, before they were alarmed again with Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Seditions amongſt the Coſſacks, whom <hi>Doroſenzko</hi> wrote he could not keep in ſubjection, unleſs he had ſome Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours ſent him from the Port. The rumors likewiſe that the Muſcovite armed, and was reſolved to Aſſiſt the Poles in recovery of their loſt Country, increaſed the apprehenſions of the Turks, who too late perceived the errour they had committed in ſo ſoon disbanding their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which before ſome were ſcarce got home, they were forced to recal. But now the year was well begun, and no grand preparations made; ſo that it was impoſſible to collect an Army in ſo ſhort a time conſiderable enough to be honoured with the Conduct of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; wherefore it was reſolved, that all things this year ſhould be diſpoſed in a readineſs againſt the next. But the Grand Signior had a project of his own to depart ſpeedily with his Court, and to paſs the heats of the Summer in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Zegna</hi> about five or ſix days Journey on his way towards <hi>Poland,</hi> which being reported to be a place well planted with Trees, watered with cool and freſh Springs, and abounding with all ſorts of Game, made him impatient to take up his Summer-quarters in a Country ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his humor; and that he might cover the deſign of pleaſure with that of profit and policy, he pretended that the report of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſo far would both haſten the Army, and give a terrour to the Enemy. But the Great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier and his Council who weighed all things bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were of another opinion, judging it neither honourable for the Court to be retired into Woods and Mountains, nor the advantage of ſuch a ſurmiſe able to countervail the expence and inconveniences of that Journy; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was concluded to ſtand unto the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, That the Grand Signior with the main Body of his Army ſhould not move until the following year, but that in this interim all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations ſhould be made for Proviſions and Ammunition, in order unto which three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Janiſaries were already ſent away to <hi>Kemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niecz</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Sampſongi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhee</hi> and ſix thouſand more under the <hi>Zagar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibaſhee</hi> were to be landed on that <hi>Iſthumus,</hi> which joyns the <hi>Crim</hi> Tartar unto the Main, from whence they had a ſhort March to the aſſiſtance of <hi>Dorhſenzko. Chaſaein</hi> Paſha lately come from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> was nominated for General to be ſent into <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> and there to command in Chief over the Militia of <hi>Dobriza, Boſna,</hi> and <hi>Rumelia</hi> in caſe of any alteration and diſturbance in <hi>Poland:</hi> this Perſon was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accounted a ſtout and valiant Souldier, though ſeldom fortunate, and was the ſame that loſt the Battel before <hi>Lewa</hi> in the laſt German Wars, as we have before intimated: he was about this time grown infirm by a hepatical Dyſentery, which reduced him to a weak condition of body, with little hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time arrived at <hi>Adrianople</hi> an Ambaſſadour from the great Czar of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:39539:119"/>bringing Letters dated in <hi>April</hi> of the preceding year, which was before the time that the Turks had entred <hi>Poland,</hi> the contents of which were, That the Grand Signior would do well to deſiſt from his deſign againſt that Country;<note place="margin">The unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of the Moſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour.</note> for that if he did proceed and invade thoſe Dominions, he ſhould find himſelf obliged to make War upon him, and with his mighty and puiſſant Power to drive him back to his own Juriſdiction. This Meſſage appeared very unſeaſonable, and cauſed much laughter at firſt; for that the Turk had ſince the Date of that Letter invaded <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and poſſeſſed himſelf of vaſt Countries, and yet neither encountred any oppoſition from the Muſcovite, nor ſo much as heard any ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of his Motion. Wherefore the Turks with ſcorn forbad the Ambaſſadour any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Addreſſes, and commanded him to be gone ſpeedily, ſaying, That his Maſter had neither courage nor force to maintain his word of War, nor wiſdom to manage a Treaty of Peace.</p>
                     <p>The Reports now from the parts of <hi>Poland</hi> ſpake matters to be in a quiet poſture, and not likely to concern the Turks much for this year; wherefore the Grand Signior began again to renew his purpoſes of paſtime and pleaſure in the Mountains of <hi>Zegna;</hi> but becauſe no true or perfect account could be given of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, refreſhments, and ſituation of that place, the <hi>Olack Celebi</hi> or chief Poſtmaſter was ſent to furvey the Country, and to return with a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all matters: but in the interim the deſign was altered; for the Grand Signior having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun a Fabrick in which he had expended about eighty thouſand Dollars, at a ſmall Village about nine or ten miles from <hi>Adrianople;</hi> the place and novelty of the Building ſo well pleaſed him, that he found in himſelf an inclination to paſs the whole Summer there; and becoming likewiſe enamoured of a young Lady in his Seraglio, notwithſtanding his former tenderneſs to his Queen, and late averſion to all other Women, he judged it was poſſible to divertiſe his time well in thoſe parts, and more to his contentment, than in wild woods and uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited mountains. Whereupon the intentions of <hi>Zegna</hi> were laid aſide, and nothing thought of but the reſt and quietneſs of the Court for this year.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it was reported, That the Czar of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> made great Preparations for War, it was judged neceſſary to command the <hi>Crim</hi> Tartar to be watchful of his motion by Land, though the natural ſlothfulneſs of that people gave them no apprehenſion of their Arms for this year; howſoever it being probable, that they might prove more active and forward in the Black Sea, than they were capable to do by Land, by ſending forth their ſmall Boats down the <hi>Volga</hi> to take and pillage the Saiks and Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels belonging to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and other parts; the Captain-Paſha was ordered to paſs into that Sea with thirty five or forty Sail of Gallies for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Coaſt, and for fortifying and repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aſac,</hi> and the Fortreſſes thereabouts but whilſt theſe Preparations were making for the Euxine or Black Sea, the other Seas were neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and undefended; for the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Fleet conſiſting in all of eight Sail,<note place="margin">The <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrian</hi> Fleet taken by the Malteſes.</note> were encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not far from <hi>Rhodes</hi> by ſome Malteſe and Ligorneſe Corſaires: the Ships of the Turks were moſt of them very great and potent Ships, one of them was at leaſt fifteen hundred Tuns, and was capable to carry an hundred Guns, the others of eight hundred or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Tuns, able to have reſiſted and overcome, had they been well armed, double the force that aſſaulted them; but being now engaged with an Enemy, though not ſo ſtrong, yet better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in marine Affairs than themſelves, they fought with them ſtoutly the firſt day; but the next day ſix Gallies coming to the Chriſtians aſſiſtance, (which had been harbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome Port not far diſtant, and led thither by the noiſe of the Cannon, to which alſo a calm giving the greater advantage) the Turks began to faint in their courage, ſo that four Gallions and two Saiks yielded to mercy, which was a Prize of ſo great value, that it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed never to have been equalled ſince the time of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> when the loſs of the grand Sultana and other Ships gave the firſt occaſion of War with <hi>Venice.</hi> This great Ship which was reported by thoſe who ſaw her to be both longer and broader than the Soveraign, carried only ſixty Guns, and was manned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly only with about an hundred Seamen, and about two hundred more which were Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, wholly unacquainted with the Sea or with Naval Fights: the biggeſt Ship amongſt the reſt was belonging to the Queen-Mother, and the others to the Grand Signior, being freighted principally with Sugar, Coffee, Rice, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſions for the proper maintenance of their Courts, which we may ſuppoſe will high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflame theſe grand Perſonages, with anger and diſdain, when they reflect on their own proper loſſes which touch them ſo nearly as their peculiar Goods and the Furniture of their Kitchins.</p>
                     <p>The Turkiſh Court now angered with this loſs, was more moved in the midſt of <hi>May,</hi> when a Meſſenger from <hi>Poland</hi> arrived with Letters from the Grand Chancellour, declaring with modeſt-terms,<note place="margin">The Poles refuſe to pay their promiſed Tribute.</note> That their Kingdom was unable or unwilling for many reſpects to pay the promiſed Tribute; ſo that if they did not judge fit to wave or lay aſide thoſe pretenſions, they ſhould be forced to take up Arms in defence of their Honour, Safety, and Priviledge of their Dominions. The Turks ſurpriſed with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Meſſage, too late perceived the errour of the laſt years proceedings, which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on with a clemency and confidence not agreeable to the diſpoſition and humor of ſuch an Enemy, as is unacquainred with ſervitude, and ſo far from being able to ſupport a Foreign Yoke, that they cannot endure ſubjection to their own Civil Government, every Nobleman (of which there are many in <hi>Poland</hi>) being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to be a Prince, judges himſelf better than his elected King. Hence proceeded all thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions which laid them open to the late inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their powerful Enemy, the apprehenſion of whom having obducted for a while thoſe ſores of Faction which feſtered amongſt them, and that principle of ſelf-conſervation, which by a forcible nature inclined them to Union, at length armed them with a reſolution to avenge the Liberties of their Country, and aſſured them of the Truth of that Saying, That <hi>a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Turks now wiſhed that they had either made a true uſe of their Victory, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune

The chief Authours of this Rebellion were <hi>Petrozy, Sepeſi, Tende, Gabor, Sutrey,</hi> and other principal perſons amongſt the Hungarians, who having on their own ſtrength oppoſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Emperour the laſt year were defeated in divers engagements, and at length reduced to a very low and miſerable condition. Wherefore they renew again their Petitions and Preſents to the Sultan, ſent by their Agents about the beginning of this Month of <hi>April,</hi> beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his aſſiſtance and protection, repreſenting the eaſineſs of the Conqueſt, and how large a Gate they were able to open to his Armies, and make a plain way for him into the moſt fertile and opulent Countries of the World, of which he ſeemed already half poſſeſſed by reaſon of thoſe Diſcontents and Factions that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</p>

                        </note> That all thoſe who eat the Grand Signior's Bread, ſhould without farther delay prepare themſelves for the Wars againſt <hi>Poland;</hi> and that Proviſions and Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be ſupplyed in all places according to the uſual proportions; The Tugh, or Horſe-Tail, (the Signal for departure) was ſet forth, the Tents ordered to be carried into the Field, and ſuch haſte made in all parts, as if the raiſing of an Army were the buſineſs, but of one day; reſolving immediately to proceed againſt their Enemies, to whom the Sultan returned a moſt dreadful and menacing Letter, full of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions agreeable to the Turkiſh Style, which threatned Confuſion, Sword, Famine, Fire, Deſtruction, and a thouſand other more direful Judgments: but the Collection of this great Army, and the appendages belonging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, were not ſo ſuddenly provided as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of ſuch a diſpatch as the Sultan's fury pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; wherefore in cooler blood it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, That for this Summer they ſhould not paſs much beyond the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> that the Winter Quarters ſhould be deſigned in <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> from whence they might more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally threaten and affright their Enemies with their near approach.</p>
                     <p>About this time the French found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ſeaſon to accommodate all their Affairs with the Port, and to put a period to the ſeveral Articles and particulars they had for many years demanded. For now the French King not only appeared very formidable by reaſon of his ſucceſs againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> but likewiſe inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to promote the deſigns of the Port, whilſt he kept the Brandenburghers employed, and diverted the whole Armies of the Empire; and now alſo that they might engage him not to contribute aſſiſtance to the Poles, they judged it reaſonable policy to evidence to that Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour more external demonſtrations of kindneſs, and ſtrain their courteſie beyond the terms which they could cordially, and in reality afford them. Wherefore, at length the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were renewed, and ſome Articles and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges ſuperadded, which are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                     <p>

                           <item>Secondly, That the Religious of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and of <hi>Bethlem</hi> ſhall conſerve thoſe religious places which they have anciently poſſeſſed, and there may continue to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate their Worſhip of God, and all their Devotions, without any diſturbance.</item>

                           <item>Sixthly, Whereas the French Nation formerly paid <hi>5 per.

                           <item>Eighthly, In payment of their Cuſtoms, they ſhall pay the Currant Mony ſuch as paſſes in our Treaſury, and the Farmers

                           <item>Eleventhly, The Cuſtom of Silk being paid — a new Cuſtom ought not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</item>
                           <item>Twelfthly, The Cuſtom being once paid, the Cuſtomer ſhall not refuſe to give his Teſchare, and the Merchant being willing to tranſport his Goods to another Scale, another Custom ſhall not be demanded.</item>
                           <item>Thirteenthly, The Officers and Cuſtomers at <hi>Sidon, Birut, Aleppo,</hi> or <hi>Cairo</hi> ſhall not compel the Merchants to take Goods by Eorce, not under any pretence whatſoever take one Aſper from them, nor demand mony to be lent unto them.</item>
                           <item>Fourteenthly, The French Veſſels may bring Goods from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by way of the Red Sea, unto the Port <hi>Suucis,</hi> and having paid their Custom once there, whatſoever Goods they cannot ſell in that Country, they may have liberty to tranſport over land to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and there relade them again on their own Veſſels without paying another Cuſtom, or receiving moleſtation from any perſon. Howſoever, this Capitulation is to be understood with this condition, that this point ſhall be ſignified to the chief Officers of <hi>Cairo,</hi> who having called a Council of the moſt knowing and experienced perſons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hereof, and they concluding that this point is in no wiſe prejudicial to that Country, nor to the Interest of the Believers then this Article to be of force, but if they adviſe the contrary, then this to be of no effect.</item>
                           <item>Fifteenthly, If the Fryars, or Merchants, or Druggermen will make Wine, and tranſport it abroad, none ſhall hinder them.</item>
                           <item>Sixteenthly, The French Conſuls, and all under their Banner, having a difference with any of or above, four thouſand Aſpers, it ſhall be decided at our publick Divan.</item>
                           <item>Seventeenthly, If any man ſlaughter ſhall happen in the ſtreet where French dwell, they ſhall not be liable to pay the price of the Bloud, unleſs it be proved before the Justice that a Frenchman was guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</item>

                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor was the French intereſt only available at that time to obtain the foregoing Articles, and renew their Capitulations with ſuch Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but likewiſe to procure Licence for the Ambaſſador to travel into the remoteſt parts of the Ottoman Dominions;<note place="margin">The French Ambaſſador obtains li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to travel.</note> for though it were a thing never practiſed before, and denied (as is well known) to other Chriſtian Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; yet it was granted to Monſieur <hi>de Nointel</hi> with ſo much freedom, that firſt in a Brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine he went to <hi>Scio,</hi> thence viſited the chief Iſles of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> thence croſſed to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and ſo proceeded to <hi>Satalia, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> ſo much confidence had the Turks, contrary to their cuſtom, in this Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador: for as they ſtile all Repreſentatives from Foreign Princes their pawns or pledges of Peace, ſo had not the Turks in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture thought the intereſt of <hi>France</hi> worth the obliging, they would never have deviated from their ancient Cuſtom, and given an example for other Miniſters to demand a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the like nature.</p>
                     <p>But to return again to the deſigns againſt <hi>Poland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Turks reſolve on a war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        </note> the Sultan about the end of <hi>July</hi> marched with ſuch Forces as were then in a readineſs towards the Confines of that Country; and though he had not with him above fifteen thouſand men, yet it was concluded that the Fame and terror of the Grand Signior's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would either abate and bring low the ſpirits of the Poles, and induce them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch an Ambaſſador with terms of Peace, or at leaſt this readineſs of the Turkiſh Camp would be an early preparation for the deſigns of the next year, and put the whole Empire into a timely motion, and that uniting with the Forces of the Frontiers, they might make a Body ſufficient to reſiſt any ſudden Incurſion. This reſolution being taken, the Great Vizier led the Van, and encamped on the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> near a place called <hi>Iſacgee,</hi> where he with all diligence built a Bridge of Boats to paſs his Forces with the greateſt facility to the other ſide, on which lies the Country of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia.</hi> The Sultan about a days journey ſhort of the Vizier, fixed his Court and Camp at a place called <hi>Babadog;</hi> with intention after ſome days to croſs the River, and proceed as far as <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> that by the influence of his powerful Preſence he might encourage his Army there, and provide all things neceſſary for ſecurity of that Garriſon. But in the mean time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices coming that the Poliſh Army, conſiſting of about twenty thouſand men, was roving about the Confines of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> and that a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation was paſſed between the King and him; and that <hi>Zircha,</hi> Commander of the Coſacks, joyned to conſiderable forces of the Moſcovite and Calmuck Tartars, had made incurſions into the parts about <hi>Oſac,</hi> cauſed the Sultan to deſiſt from his deſigned progreſs to <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> and to paſs no farther than over the River into <hi>Moldavia</hi> for hunting or other paſtimes. By theſe matters the Turks being fully convinced, that the Poles reſolved not to pay their promiſed tribute, nor to ſend an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador with propoſitions, which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending or ſupplicating for Peace; the Sultan himſelf diſpatched away an Aga with Letters into <hi>Poland</hi> full of threats, menaces, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of bringing all that ruine, miſery, and deſtruction on their Country, which always attends the moſt cruel and bloudy War, if they did not retrieve their error by a ſpeedy
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:39539:121"/>ſubmiſſion and compliance with thoſe Articles which were the laſt year accorded. And this was the laſt motion the Turks made towards a Peace, which they were deſirous to embrace on any terms honourable, that ſo they might have opportunity to divert their Arms to the more mild Climates of <hi>Hungary,</hi> where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſids the entertainment they expected to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from friends, who invited them, they ſhould not be liable to half thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of Cold, Froſts, and Famine, as they were probable to meet in the parts of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Poles were ſo much in earneſt, and ſo little eſteemed the menaces of the Sultan, that they anticipated his threats by ſome acts of hoſtility, and ſhowed that they ſo much ſcorned his anger that they were reſolved to be the firſt Aggreſſors.<note place="margin">The Poles paſs the <hi>Neiſter.</hi>
                        </note> For the great Mareſchal <hi>Sobieski</hi> with his Lieutenant General <hi>Wiſno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witzki</hi> marched forward, and boldly paſſed the <hi>Nieſter</hi> with fifty thouſand ſelect Souldiers. The General of the Turkiſh Army, <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, alarmed hereat, immediately iſſued forth ſuch Orders for preparing and fitting his Camp as were agreeable to a ſpeedy Battel; and that he might underſtand the ſtate of his Camp, he called the Prince or Vayvord of <hi>Moldavia</hi> to examine him concerning the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Forces; the anſwer he gave proving not ſatisfactory to the expectation of the Turk, who was enraged at the approach of the Enemy, with high and proud words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted over the Prince, giving him no better terms than Dog and Infidel, and at length ſtruck him over the head with his Pole-Axe; notwithſtanding which, and the diſgrace he put upon him, imprudently that night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, and to the Prince of <hi>Valachia,</hi> the care of the Guards, which conſiſted of three thouſand Men. The Valachians as near Neighbours and Aſſociates with the others,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Valachia</hi> carried by his own Souldiers to the Poles.</note> ſeemed at firſt more grievouſly to reſent the affront, than did the Moldavians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Night took their Prince by force and carried him to the Poliſh Army. The Prince, that he might make a Vertue of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, complained of no force or violence offered unto him by his Souldiers, but as if he had voluntarily revolted, ſhowed outwardly a fair and ſerene countenance towards the Poles, until ſuch time as with forty of his Men, he found an opportunity to eſcape; but being by next morning at break of day overtaken by five Troops of Polonian Horſe, his whole Retinue was ſlain by them, excepting five of his men, who with himſelf, ſaved themſelves by the ſwiftneſs of their Horſes; Howſoever, the Prince received a wound on his left hand with a Sword, with which preſenting himſelf before the Great Vizier, and by that teſtimony boaſting of his Faith and Loyalty to the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Houſe, was conducted by him to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sultan, who, in reward of his fidelity and valour, veſted him with a rich Coftan, and reſtored him again to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality with addition of three hundred Aſpers a day pay. His Wife and Children which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as Hoſtages at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being upon the News of the Princes Revolt clapt into the ſeven Towers, were again releaſed, and conducted to their houſe with all imaginable honour and magnificence.</p>
                     <p>But the Moldavian Prince was more in earneſt, and heartily diſdained the affront of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him by <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, towards whom, and the other Turks, though he carried a ſerene and calm coutenance, yet he nouriſhed a ſecret flame and ſtorm within himſelf; to vent which, and revenge the affront, he maintained a correſpondence with <hi>Sobieski,</hi> giving him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all matters in the Turkiſh Camp,<note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volts.</note> how he might moſt eaſily ſurprize the Forces of the Paſha of <hi>Sivas,</hi> and the four Generals of the Spahees of <hi>Alchabolick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Chriſtians made uſe of this intelligence accordingly, by making their aſſault on the Enemy on the weakeſt ſide, when the Prince having reſerved his anger until an opportune Seaſon, turned his face againſt the Turks, and with a courage agreeable to his ſpirit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he entered the Tabor, or Intrenchment of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, and wounded him with his own hand. The heat of the Fight continued fourteen hours, in which none behaved himſelf more valianlty than did <hi>Solyman</hi> Paſha the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbeg of <hi>Boſna,</hi> who though he was as brave and fought as ſtoutly as any man could having ſix Horſes that day killed under him,<note place="margin">The Turks overthrow.</note> he was at length forced to fly and abandon the field, following <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, of <hi>Sivas</hi> and <hi>Ciddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogla,</hi> who made better uſe, in ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of their horſes heels, than their own Arms; But in this Flight his Horſe pitching his foot into the hole of a wooden Bridge, which he was to paſs, was there ſtopped until he was overtaken by a Souldier with a Hat, who ſhot him through the Body; ſo that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing his flight more faintly than before, he was overtaken by a Palonian Huſſar, who with a Lance bore him to the Ground, where he was trod under foot, and cut in pieces by the Enemy: The other three Paſhaws were wounded; the Generals of the Green and Yellow Sangiacks of the Spahees were taken Priſoners, and two other principal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Spahees were killed. The Zagar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geebaſhee, who commanded eighteen Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Janiſaries, was taken priſoner, the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the Janiſaries taken, and they wholly cut in pieces and deſtroyed, conſiſting of eight thouſand five hundred men; all the Troops and Attendants of thoſe Paſhaws, with four Sangiacks of Spahees, were ſlain upon the place, which in all were computed to be about twenty five thouſand men. The booty taken was very conſiderable, for beſides the ordinary Baggage they took two thouſand purſes of money, then newly brought for payment of the Souldiery, and twenty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Waggons of Proviſions and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>After this ſucceſs and important Victory the Poles became Maſters of the ſtrong Fortreſs of <hi>Chotin,</hi> and other ſmaller Palanchas, on the Banks of the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> making their Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> as far as <hi>Jaſh,</hi> which is the principal City of that Country. And thus far was <hi>Kaplan</hi> Paſha proceeded with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of about four thouſand men, when the News came of the fatal Rout, and the fame thereof encreaſing by the fearful Relations of ſuch as fled from the Battel, alarmed the Turks with ſuch frightful apprehenſions, that they retreated back again to the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and united themſelves to the Forces of the Vizier. But <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, though he ſaved his life, yet could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:39539:121"/>the Air of the Sultan's favour; for ſo ſoon as he arrived at the Court, he received an ill welcome; for according to the manner of Turks,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned.</note> who puniſh the ill ſucceſs of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral equal to Crimes committed, he was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately put into Chains, deprived of his eſtate and honours, and ſent priſoner with the attendance only of two ſervants unto the Caſtles of the <hi>Dardanelli,</hi> where the diſturbance and unquietneſs of his mind reduced him to an infirmity of Body; ſo that being ſick, and without Friends or Phyſicians, he ſent to Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> his Majeſties Ambaſſador, as he paſſed up the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> to afford him the uſe and aſſiſtance of his Phyſician; but the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador excuſed himſelf, letting him know, that his Retinue being paſſed before on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veſſel, he was ſorry it was not in his power to accommodate him in the manner he deſired.</p>
                     <p>The Winter being now well entered, which is very wet and cold in thoſe Coutries, cauſed the Armies on both ſides to draw into their warmet Quatters, there to meditate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive their deſigns for the more active ſeaſon. During theſe Affairs the King of <hi>Poland</hi> died; ſo that the Election of a new Prince,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Poland</hi> dies.</note> the manner of reconciling their inteſtine Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and the means to defend their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, were Subjects of important Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and matters more than ſufficient to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the wiſeſt heads of that Nation for a longer time than their common Enemy was reſolved to afford them. The Turk on the other ſide though full of revenge and anger for their laſt misfortune, yet patiently took this loſs as the paring only of his Nails, that his Claws might grow the longer, and was ſo rowſed with this blow, that he ſummoned all the Nations of his large Empire to come in to his aſſiſtance, towards which forty thouſand Carts laden with Proviſions were appointed to rendezvous on the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the month of <hi>March.</hi> Yet in the mean time the Turks not having patience to ſee their perfidious Prince avail himſelf of his Revolt, and in Deſpight of the Ottoman Power to to ſeat himſelf in his Principality of <hi>Jaſh,</hi> were reſolved to drive him thence; and in order thereunto not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting a milder ſeaſon, immediately diſpeeded ſome Troops of Tartars, and two thouſand Spahees under the Command of a new Prince, to drive him out of the Country. In the mean time the Poles, ſince their late Victory, kept the Fortreſs of <hi>Kemenitz</hi> ſtraitly blocked up on all ſides, and thereby reduced them to ſuch a want of food and other proviſions, as might probably cauſe them to ſurrender before the Summer could open a way to their relief.</p>
                     <p>But before I conclude this Year, I muſt not omit to acquaint the Reader, that in the month of <hi>September</hi> an Engliſh Factor at <hi>Smyrna</hi> deſcended of good Parents, and educated under a ſevere and religious Maſter, one who had a reaſonable Eſtate of his own, and in good buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and employment, did notwithſtanding in the abſence of his Partner, with whom he was joyned in Commiſſion, carry out of the houſe 215 ½ fine Cloths belonging to ſeveral Principals of <hi>England,</hi> with a conſiderable Sum of ready Mony, Jewels, and things of value: of which having poſſeſſed himſelf, he went before the Kadi, and there in preſence of divers Officers of the City turned Turk, hoping by the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Mahometan Law, whereby no Chriſtian teſtimony can paſs againſt a Turk, to appropriate unto himſelf that whole Eſtate, which he had thus treacherouſly got into his ſole cuſtody. And it being impoſſible for Turks to atteſt the Marks, Numbers, or know the Eſtates of Perſons being in <hi>England,</hi> he judged himſelf out of the reach of any Power or Art to diſpoſſeſs him of his unjuſt and wicked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. Howſoever the Conſul did ſo cloſely purſue him both at <hi>Smyrna</hi> and at the Turkiſh Court, that in the ſpace of ſeven months he regained all the Cloth, and the beſt part of the Mony and Jewels out of his hands: and in fine reduced this Renegado to ſo low a condition, that he humbly ſupplicated the Conſul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way for his paſſage into <hi>England:</hi> at which time His Majeſties Frigate the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> being then in Port, he was imbarked thereupon, and ſo returned into his own Country.</p>
                     <p>The Particulars of all which having been amply related in Writing and Letters to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Friends, I purpoſely omit the ſame in this place, that ſo I might caſt a veil over the nakedneſs and ſhame of our Nation in that City. Howſoever I judge it requiſite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this Story in brief and in general heads, That men may know there is a God who rules above, who rejects impious and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, confounding the deſigns of thoſe who betraying their Truſt, deviate from the common Rules of Morality and Honeſty.</p>

                     <p>THis Year began at <hi>Smyrna</hi> with the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Arrival of Sir <hi>John Finch,</hi> ſent by His Majeſty for Ambaſſador to the Grand Signior in the place of Sir <hi>Daniel Harvey,</hi> who dyed in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1672. at his Country-houſe not far from <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> His Excellency entred the City on the firſt day of <hi>January</hi> 1673/4 rejoycing the Engliſh Factory with the ſight of their new Ambaſſador, (that Office having been now void for the ſpace of ſixteen months) who was welcome alſo to people of the Country, judging him fortunate for arriving at the Feaſt of their great <hi>Biram:</hi> nor leſs pleaſing was the News thereof to the Court, eſpecially to the late Paſha of <hi>Tunis,</hi> whoſe Goods and Monies taken by one <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minico Franceſchi,</hi> out of an Engliſh Ship called the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> in her paſſage from <hi>Tunis</hi> to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> this Ambaſſador had recovered from <hi>Ligorne</hi> and <hi>Malta;</hi> which being an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without example, was greatly admired and applauded by the Turks, and eſteemed an evident demonſtration of that great Intereſt and Power which the Glory of our King hath acquired in Foreign parts, and of the ſingular dexterity of ſuch a Miniſter.</p>
                     <p>About the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> Sir <hi>John Finch</hi> arrived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> being tranſported to the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> on his Majeſties Fregat the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion; and thence on a Gally hired at <hi>Smyrna</hi> for that purpoſe. Some few days after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, the Grand Signior and Vizier being at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> the Lord Ambaſſador had audience of the <hi>Chimacam</hi> whom he ſaluted with this ſpeech.</p>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:39539:122"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I am come Ambaſſadour from Charles the Second King of</hi> England, Scotland, France, <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>ſole Lord and Soveraign of all the Seas, that environ his Kingdoms, Lord and Soveraign of vast territories, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions in the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt-Indies, <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Chriſtian Faith againſt all thoſe that Worſhip Idols or Images. To the moſt Powerful and mighty Emperor of the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>to maintain that peace, which hath been ſo uſeful, and that commerce which hath been ſo profitable to this Empire: For the continuance, and encreaſe whereof I promiſe you in my ſtation to contribute what I can, and I promiſe to my ſelf, that you in your will do the like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed to the Wars. The Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders being thus proſperous, made uſe of their ſucceſs, and the ſharp cold of the Winter-ſeaſon to make their Incurſions, and Winter-quarters through all the Principalities of <hi>Moldavia;</hi> for they being born in cold Countries, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the Snows and Froſts, were more patient and enduring of extremity of weather than were the Turks, who were brought forth from more mild and moderate Climates: ſo that neither could the Poles be driven out from thoſe Countries, nor <hi>Keminitz</hi> be relieved by them, until ſuch time, that the Sun getting high, and thawing the Snows, and warming the Earth, prepared a ſeaſon fit for return of the Turks who marching according to their cuſtom with an Army compoſed of great multitudes, quickly compelled the Poles to retire. For the Grand Signior and Vizier having both ſeated their Winter-quarters on the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> were ready at the firſt opening of the Summer to enter their Arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Enemies Countries; and having called the Tartars to their aſſiſtance, did according to the uſual cuſtom make Incurſions for depredati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Slaves, Cattel, and whatſoever elſe was portable in a running March.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Chan</hi> or King of this People was at that time greatly indiſpoſed in his health, of which he adviſed the Great Vizier, as if he intended thereby to obtain a releaſe from his perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance that year in the War: But the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier, who either ſuppoſed this excuſe to be only a pretence, or that he had a kindneſs for his Perſon, immediately diſpatched away his own Phyſician called Signior <hi>Maſſelini,</hi> an Italian born, a worthy Learned man, a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and my intimate Friend: with whom maintaining a conſtant correſpondence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he wrote me,<note place="margin">A Journy into <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi>
                        </note> That from the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors Quarters which were at <hi>Batadog</hi> near the Banks of the <hi>Danube,</hi> he arrived after ſeventeen days Journey in <hi>Chrim,</hi> where (he ſaid) he was received with ſingular honour and kindneſs by the Great <hi>Chan,</hi> whom he found to be a Prince of admirable prudence, gentleneſs, and generoſity, but greatly afflicted with a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal Melancholy; which being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of ſome years ſtanding, was with the more difficulty removed; howſoever he was ſo far from being uncapable to follow his Army, that he adviſed him to divert his mind with the thoughts of War: which counſel having taken, after thirty days abode in the Camp, he found himſelf much more chearful than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and greatly relieved of that preſſure of Melancholy and caliginous Vapours which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended his Brain. <q>We are now (ſaid he) at <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſſia</hi> at the Mouth of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> which we have paſſed from the other ſide unto this, where the River is nine miles broad, from hence we are marching towards <hi>Bender</hi> upon the <hi>Nieſter</hi> to paſs into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> and there to joyn with the Ottoman Army. The Poles have ſent to demand Peace, but with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that <hi>Kemenitz</hi> be reſtored to them; which Propoſition was with great diſdain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and will never be granted whilſt this Emperour reigns. Theſe people greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> which the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sobieski</hi> for King may probably facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; for not only they, but the Turks alſo dread a March into <hi>Poland,</hi> and are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterately bent to take revenge on the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites and Coſacks, who lately became their Subjects, that they could accept of any reaſonable Terms of Accommodation with <hi>Poland.</hi> I for my part found <hi>Tartary</hi> a very pleaſant Country, plentiful of all Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the people much more courteous and obliging to the Strangers and Chriſtians, than thoſe Turks with whom you and I have converſed.</q> Thus far <hi>Maſſelini</hi> writes in commendation of the Tartars, and in farther confirmation hereof, I have read in ſome Books, That as to their Morals, there are very few Nations to be found leſs vicious, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſevere and faithful, they have no Thieves or falſe Witneſſes amongſt them, little Injuſtice or Violence, and live in union and great tranquillity: the marvellous fidelity of the Captive Tartars in <hi>Poland</hi> is every day to be obſerved, who never fail to return at the time appointed, when they are licenſed upon their word to go and procure their Liberties by the exchange of Poliſh Priſoners, which they execute punctually, or return themſelves, not failing a minute. And it is obſerved, That the Poliſh Gentlemen do rather truſt the young Tartars, which are in their Service, with the keys of their Money and Jewels, than any of their Houſhold.</p>
                     <p>The time for Armies to draw out of the Winter-quarters, and take the Field being now come, the Grand Signior and Vizier, with great numbers both of Horſe and Foot paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and proſecuting their March to the Confines of <hi>Poland,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Kemenitz relieved.</note> they relieved <hi>Kemenitz</hi> in the firſt place, the Poles at the News of their approach raſing the Siege. Thence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to <hi>Chuozim,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs on the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> taken from them in the laſt year by the Chriſtians, after the defeat given to <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Paſha, as before related, the which was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred without much difficulty on Articles, which were ill obſerved, the whole Garriſon being afterwards put to the Sword. Nor had they worſe ſucceſs againſt the Muſcovites, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated backward as the Turk advanced, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Aſac,</hi> after it had been ſacked and almoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, to be again rebuilt, which was ſpeedily effected by the aſſiſtance of the Captain-Paſha, who was that year with thirty nine Gallies diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeded into the Black Sea, and with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Slaves and Souldiers repaired the ruines which the Muſcovites had made. In the mean time, whilſt the chiefeſt ſtrength of the marine Force was thus employed, a ſmall Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of about ten Gallies were ordered for the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:39539:122"/>
                        <hi>Archipelago</hi> and the Levant, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha, a Perſon that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged ſundry great Employments; but his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality and profuſe way of living was the cauſe that he could thrive in none, only he thereby gained ſo much intereſt and credit with the Grandees and Monied men of the Court, who are the Pages and Eunuchs, as ſerved him to contract a debt of the thouſand Dollars without any ability of his own to give them ſatisfaction: of which theſe Creditors being aſſured, made it their Petition to the Grand Signior to grant him the Command of that Squadron of Gallies, which was that year deſigned for the <hi>Archipelago,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha ſent with a Fleet of Gallies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> ſuppoſing that he in this Expedition being to paſs unto many Iſlands and Conutries, knew how to make ſuch uſe of his time, and the advantage of his Employment, as would gain him a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient benefit whereby to ſatisfie and clear all ſcores and accounts with them. This Office being accordingly conferred, <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha prepared himſelf to depart, whilſt the Creditors remained in ful expectation of a profitable Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and ſpeedy returns; which to improve to the beſt advantage, the Paſha firſt viſited the open and undefended Iſles, from whence with the greateſt ſeverity and rapine imaginable he pillag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and plundered what he was able, making ſome of them to ranſom their whole Country with mony. Thence he proceeded to <hi>Scala No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> called by the Turks <hi>Kouſh-adaſee,</hi> a place on the Coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> not far from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where he demanded of the people (though all Turks) the Sum of five thouſand Dollars, which they not finding to pay, were treated with all kind of force and violence, till at length paying down 1500, and engaging to pay the reſt in a months time, the Paſha departed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Aga, a Servant of his, to receive the money at the time agreed. In that interim, the Kadi coming to be changed, and another of more courage and ſpirit ſucceeding in his place, believed that the beſt ſervice at his beginning and entrance into Office which he could perform towards the people, was to relieve them from the oppreſſion of the Paſha, and perſwade them poſitively to refuſe the payment; who taking courage from their Chief, drove the Aga out of Town, with a thouſand menaces and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, Upon this News <hi>Mehmet</hi> Paſha re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again full of anger and indignation, but found not that eaſie reception nor kind enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, as before; but on the contrary, the Gates were ſhut againſt him, and the people abandoning their Habitations, with common conſent reſolved to make a Journey, to the Grand Signior: and to ſhew they were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, proceeded ſo far in their way as to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which is about ten miles diſtant from thence: the prejudice and danger of which complaint <hi>Mahomet</hi> Paſha greatly fearing, ſent Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to pacifie them with good words and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to relinquiſh his pretenſions, in caſe they would return; but the uproar was ſo great, that they found as much difficulty to quiet it, as the Town-Clerk in ancient times had to appeaſe the Tumult raiſed by the Silverſmiths about <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Being thus baffled at <hi>Kouſh-adaſee,</hi> he vented his fury on ſome poor Iſlands which he could more eaſily maſter, and thence proceeded to <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> where the people being already alarmed with his behaviour, and violence of his actions in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, and encouraged by the example of <hi>Kouſh-adaſee,</hi> upon his arrival there, without farther ceremony ſhut their Gates, and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed armed againſt him upon the Walls; at which entertainment and unexpected oppoſition, the Paſha fearing ſome evil conſequences, ſet ſail from thence, and croſſing again the Seas into <hi>Aſia,</hi> made <hi>Rhodes</hi> his next Port. Thence he paſſed to <hi>Satalia,</hi> to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Scanderone,</hi> and ſo again returned for <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> taking <hi>Smyrna</hi> in his way, committing moſt extreme rapine and violence on the people, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints having gone before him to the Court, he was immediately cut off at his arrival; but in the firſt place, his gains and ill gotten goods were ſeized on to ſatisfie the Grand Signior, and his Creditors of the Seraglio, who being ſent to fiſh for Wealth, was ſerved like the Cormorants in the <hi>Indies,</hi> which being made tame, and taught to fiſh for the benefit of their Maſters, have a Ring clapped about their necks to prevent them from ſwallowing the prey they take.</p>
                     <p>But to return to the Actions at Land, which were matters of the greateſt importance. The Turks had no ſooner relieved <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>Choczim,</hi> and cauſed the Muſcovites to retreat, and draw their Forces into their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;<note place="margin">The Turks ſeclude their Conqueſt.</note> but being Maſters of the Field, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the choice of acting according to their own pleaſure, reſolved to ſecure the places they already poſſeſſed, eſteeming it more wiſdom to make ſure their late acquiſitions, than to add thereunto new conqueſts, which they could not maintain. And therefore conſidering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the Coſacks, who having abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſubjection to <hi>Poland,</hi> had ſubmitted themſelves to their yoke; and alſo how unable <hi>Doroſenzko</hi> their Governour was either to keep them in obedience, or elſe to defend them from the Polonian Incurſions; they reſolved for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of theſe inconveniences, and for a ſecure remedy againſt any ſiniſter accidents of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to make ſeiſure of that Party of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks, who had not ſubmitted to them, and tranſport them into other parts, which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly put into execution, and ſweeping all the Countries as they paſſed, carried away men, women, and children into Captivity: part of which, ſuch as belonged to the Grand Signior, had ſome Lands aſſigned them along the Coaſt near the Black Sea; the Armenians, who were a Trading people, and lived at <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> were tranſported to <hi>Philipopoli;</hi> of the Jews ſome were carried to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and others to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> but the younger ſort of both Sexes were permitted to the Souldiery to carry them for Slaves to their own homes, and were in great numbers diſperſed through all parts of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: a Policy anciently uſed by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to his Egyptian Subjects, who having bought their Lands of them, did afterwards tranſport them from one end of the Land unto the other, that ſo he might keep them in the greater ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſubjection, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.21. <hi>And as for the people, he moved them from one end of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Egypt to the other.</hi> And in this manner the ſucceſs concluding the year, without any great Enterpriſe or Feats of Arms, the Sultan returned to his Court at <hi>Adrianople</hi> about the end of <hi>November,</hi> licenſing all the Aſian Horſe and Souldiers of remoteſt parts to return to their own Countries, with liberty to appropriate the the following year to their repoſe and care for their peculiar concernments.</p>

                     <p>To theſe Wars amongſt ſecular Perſons and men of Arms were added Differences, and never to be decided Controverſies between the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of the Roman and Greek Churches at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

                        </note> who contending for the poſſeſſion of the Holy Sepulchre of the King of Peace, rent that ſeamleſs Coat of Chriſt, and managed their Controverſie with more malice and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour each againſt other, than Princes do, who invade one the other with Fire and Sword. For the Franks or Weſtern Chriſtians ſubjected to the Popes Dominion, had poſſeſſed for ſeveral Ages a right to the Holy Sepulchre, and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the honour of the cuſtody thereof, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the pretences of the Greeks thereunto, who for many years in vain attempted at the Ottoman Court to obtain that Priviledge; for the Franks being ever more powerful by chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table contributions brought from Chriſtendom, beſides large Sums of Money from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and always outbid the Market of the Greeks, and conſequently made uſe of ſtronger arguments, than the adverſe Party could produce in defence of their cauſe. Until ſuch time, that one <hi>Panaioti,</hi> a Greek born in the Iſland of <hi>Scio,</hi> having by his parts and excellent addreſs arrived to the honour of being Interpreter for the Weſtern Tongues to the Great Vizier, at length obtained that favour with his Maſter, that he ſeldom refuſed whatſoever he with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and modeſty requeſted; and being a great Zelot in his Religion, and eſteemed the chief Patron and Support of the Greek Church, he ſecretly begged in behalf of his Country, the recovery of the Holy Sepulchre at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of the hands of the Franks; which the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier would not deny him, both to reward him for ſome ſervices already performed, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe becauſe he knew that a conceſſion of this nature would again raiſe the ſpirits and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of Chriſtians; the allaying and appeaſing of which being an office ſolely in the power of himſelf, and the ſupreme Authority, would certainly prove beneficial to the Ottoman Court. <hi>Panaioti</hi> having obtained this Command, and conſidering that the defence thereof would be a trouble to him, for that thereby he ſhould cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Enemies which were no leſs than Kings and Princes to contend with, and perhaps ſhould live to ſee it reverſed, wiſely laid it by him, there to remain dormant until the time of his death; which happening the year paſt, the Command was produced and brought to light, and was before the <hi>Eaſter</hi> of this year ſet on foot at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by virtue thereof the cuſtody of the Sepulchre ſentenced by the Paſha and Kadi of that place to belong unto the Greeks, the which was occaſion of ſo great trouble and confuſion, as diſturbed the Holy Feaſt, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the Sacrifices with the blood of one or two perſons, who moſt earneſtly contended for the Priviledge of their Nation and Religion. Nor could this difference be decided here, but both ſides appealed to the Court above; which being heard and debated in publick Divan, the poſſeſſion of the Sepulchre was adjudged in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Greeks; the Franks being only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a precarious the thereof, as Pilgrims and Strangers to the Country. Howſoever the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> would not tamely yield up their Right, but again reſolved to try their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune at the Court, having by means of <hi>F. Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi> their Commiſſario with expence of a great Sum of Money obtained a review of the caſe, but without ſucceſs; for all theſe endeavours and charge proved fruitleſs, the former ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being confirmed in favour of the Greeks; and the Franks having no other Expedient, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themſelves to the aſſiſtance of the French Ambaſſadour, to whoſe protection the Holy places are aſſigned by Capitulations. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the power of the French Ambaſſadour, nor of any other Chriſtian Repreſentative was avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for the Vizier either mindful of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to <hi>Panaioti,</hi> or being reſolute to maintain the Command he had given, would on no terms be perſwaded to revoke it; the which intention of the Vizier being made known to the Greeks their Patriarch earneſtly preſſed a hearing of the caſe; but the Fryars not willing to abide the ſhock, retired to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> leſt the Greeks forcing them to Juſtice, they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>in Judicio contradictorio,</hi> and a Hoget or Sentence paſſing, they ſhould be condemned in Law as well as by Authority of the Hatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheriff. Which to put in execution, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch took out a Command whereunto was added, That the Fryers in token of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſhould pay a Drachm of Silver a head to the Patriarch, and hold all their places of them. This was the iſſue of the preſent contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, which is certainly determined for the time of the Vizier without revocation, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in the time of another, it may admit of a review for money, eſpecially being received when as yet the new Miniſter hath not ſatiated his covetous deſires; howſoever, the expence will always bechargeable, and the ſucceſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. Thus have I ſeen and obſerved in this particular the effect and experience of two things; <hi>viz.</hi> The covetouſneſs and pride of Fryars, and the concluſion of their Law-ſuits before Infidels. The Franks, or the Weſtern Chriſtians, had until this time the cuſtody of the Holy Sepulchre, and the Greeks that of the Chappel of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> but the uſe was free to both; but the Franks not being able to enjoy the Sepulchre with contentment, whilſt with envious eyes they beheld the Greeks in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> were always contriving deſigns by force of money, and power of Chriſtian Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to eject them from that Right; until that now in theſe contentions they have loſt both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither able to recover the one, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the other.</p>
                     <p>Before we end this year of 1674. and begin that of 1675; it will be neceſſary for us to diſcourſe of the cauſe, and original of that War which <hi>England</hi> had with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbary,</hi> and the ſucceſs and concluſion thereof.</p>

                        </note> Old <hi>Mahomet</hi> boar at <hi>Scio</hi> and of the <hi>Greek</hi> race who for many years by <hi>Baratz</hi> or commiſſion from the Grand Signior had boaren the Office, and Title of Paſha of <hi>Tripoli;</hi> and being grown very rich, and covetous by the Pyracies his Ships made on the Chriſtians, and oppreſſion of his people, not dividing amongſt the Souldiery, that juſt proportion of the prey, which of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, ſo incenſed the minds of that people, that conſpiring againſt him they murdered him in his Caſtle, and ſeized all his riches, to the uſe of the Publick. The Paſha being dead all his creatures, and perſons that boar Office in his time were diſplaced, and others of more juſtice, and bravery (as they
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:39539:123"/>imagined), put in their places, and a New Governor being ſet up, he began to make a through Reformation, and to alter and change every thing according, to his own humor, and pleaſure. In the firſt place he gave leave to all people to Arm in <hi>Corſo,</hi> or to ſet out Private Men of War, as every one pleaſed, and was able; different to the practiſe of the former Paſha, who reſerved that benefit, and priviledge to himſelf; and next it was propoſed to conſtitute a Divan after the manner of <hi>Algier</hi> in whom the ſupream power of all ſhould be lodged. In order hereunto they immediately, ſet forth to Sea ſix Sail of Ships from forty to fifty Guns, excellent Saylors, and armed them with the beſt and ſtouteſt of their Men, together with four more from twelve to thirty Guns; with theſe Ships they took many prizes belonging to <hi>French, Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and other Nations; and though they had long deſired to taſte alſo of the ſweetneſs of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Eſtates; yet not encountring a prize worthy the trouble and evil conſequences of ſuch a breach; they for ſome time deferred the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which they had long meditated. Till at length about the Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1674. they unhappily encountred the <hi>Martin,</hi> a rich Ship bound from <hi>Venice</hi> to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> which they carried to <hi>Tripoly;</hi> and on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following, they ſeconded this outrage, by other of the like nature, committed on the <hi>Hunter</hi> Fregat, <hi>Thomas Parker</hi> Commander bound from <hi>Ligorne</hi> to <hi>Smyrna;</hi> whom the <hi>Tripolines</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſix Men of War at the entrance into the <hi>Arche-pelago,</hi> they brought her into the Port of <hi>Tripoly;</hi> where having plundered all the ſtrangers goods laden upon her, to the import of forty thouſand dollars, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of all which were given under Oath of the Commander, the Ship was diſmiſſed, and diſpeeded on her Voyage to <hi>Smyrna</hi> with no other damage to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then the embezel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 726 dollars, robbed, or pilfered by the Souldiery, together which ſuch charge, as the Conſul of <hi>Tripoly</hi> challenged for his ſervice therein. This news being adviſed into <hi>England,</hi> as a breach of Peace, his Majeſty out of his uſual and gratious care of the welfare of Trade, was pleaſed to order Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> his Commander in chief in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, to demand ſatisfaction from that people; who accordingly Sailing thither, and requiring reſtitution of the goods injuriouſly taken, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a denial, and denunciation of War. Whereupon Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> wrote to the Conſul of <hi>Smyrna</hi> in this manner.</p>

                     <p>Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> having fitted himſelf at <hi>Ligorne,</hi> and recruited with an additional Squadron of ſix or ſeven Men of War he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted for <hi>Tripoly,</hi> taking under his Convoy, the <hi>Vyner, Briſtol</hi> Merchant, and Mediterranean for <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and now appearing before the Port of <hi>Tripoly</hi> in a formidable manner, the <hi>Pyrates</hi> began to repent of their late violation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they muſt now either diſgorge their ill got goods, or prove the evil effects of War; their hearts began now to fail them, ſo that they unrigged all their Ships, laying them up cloſe in the harbour, and with them for the preſent all thoughts of roving on the Seas; for ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships could not lye alwaies in that Station, but that bad weather or want of proviſions would enforce them ſome time to retire, they hoped in that interval to find an opportunity to lanch into the Seas, where being clear, and good Saylors, they might have room enough to eſcape. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> with his Squadron, continued with ſuch diligence on the coaſt, plying them with continual allarms, ſtanding off to ſea at night, and towards the land in the day; that they found not the heart, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to adventure abroad; until one of their Ships, which had formerly been their Rere-Admiral, bound with Negroes for the <hi>Morea;</hi> reſolved to hazard an eſcape; but not being able to make her paſſage good, ſhe was forced aſhoar, and burnt by our Ship, moſt of the Negroes falling into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands; ſome few days after Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> fired three of their Galeots, burnt a Satee, took a fiſher-boat and a Sambechin; with which ſucceſs being encouraged, and the Enemy affrighted, their Ships were blocked up in Port for ſome months, whiſt ours found free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage on the Seas; until that at length growing weary of ſo long a demorage, neceſſity drove them to adventure abroad, which two of their beſt Men of War ſucceſsfully effected on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> in deſpight of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron, being aſſiſted with calm weather, and help of their Oares: four others obſerving the ſucceſs of the former in a few days after at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted the like, and eſcaped in the ſame manner. And now the Commanders of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ships in diverſe Ports, taking falſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, on confidence that the <hi>Tripolines</hi> were blocked up in their Ports, truſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with unadviſed ſecurity into the Seas; amongſt which none was ſo unfortunate, as a Ship called the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Merchant one <hi>Plummer</hi> Commander, laden with eighty two Bales of Silk, beſides other rich commodities bound from <hi>Smyrna</hi> to <hi>Ligorne,</hi> whereon were ſeveral Merchants, ſome of which having lived many years in <hi>Smyrna</hi> had acquired plentiful Eſtates:
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:39539:124"/>namely Mr. <hi>John Foley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Laxton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jacob Turner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Phillip Gell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tiſon</hi> Nephew to Mr. <hi>Foley;</hi> Perſons who expected a proſperous Voyage, and a happy arrival in their own Country: But obſerve here the courſe of humane diſappointments, for being imbarked on the Ship aforſaid they ſet Sail from <hi>Smyrna</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> or <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> in company with the Vyner which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be about two or three days after the <hi>Tripolines</hi> had firſt broken out of their Port; theſe two Ships by bad weather, or want of due care loſt company each with other in the <hi>Arche-pelago,</hi> which proved a happy fortune to the <hi>Vyner;</hi> for the <hi>Briſtol</hi> Merchant, ſome few days after being off of <hi>Cape Sapientia</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred the two <hi>Tripolines</hi> which firſt came out of Port, and being Veſſels of forty to fifty Gunds, ſoon made themſelves Maſters of a Merchant-ſhip laden, and of mean force. The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polines</hi> were greatly elevated with this rich prize which they immediately carried to a place called <hi>Derno;</hi> and there landing their goods, and men; for better ſecurity tranſported them over land to <hi>Tripoli.</hi> The Perſons we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before, were forced for the moſt part to walk all the way a foot, being thirty four days journey, unleſs ſome times, they were favoured to mount a Camel, which is ſuch an unpleaſant way of riding, that walking is much more eaſie; and travailing in a ſandy, dry Country, water was very ſcarce, the days journies being commonly proportioned according to the diſtance of the Wells of Water; which they drank with tetter Appetites, and Pleaſure, then they formerly relliſhed the moſt pleaſant Wines. Being arrived at <hi>Tripoli</hi> they were ill wellcomed by the ſevere looks, and hard diet which they received from their Heſts; and the Plague raging greatly in the City, added to the miſeries, and dread of the place.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Tripolines</hi> encouraged with this prize, and with the expectation of the farther ſucceſs of their Ships abroad, hoped to weary out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron, which ſtill continued to infeſt and trouble their coaſts taking their Corn, Boats, and interrupting all Commerce which that Town had with the Sea. At length the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> reſolved to make an attempt on the Ships in Harbour which they reſolutely performed in the night, and with great ſucceſs according to this relation which Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> gave under his own hand.</p>

Such was the wonderful mercy of God towards us, that not one man of ours, was killed, wounded or touched; nor a boat any way diſabled, but all returned in ſafety, bringing the Guard boat, two Moors, and the Turkiſh Colours of the four Ships in triumph along with them to my Ship.

                        <hi>Morat Bei</hi> General of all the Land Forces in the Kingdom of <hi>Tunis</hi> dyed, the moſt Politick, and Popular Perſon, that ever mannaged that Office, his Sons <hi>Ciddi Mehmet</hi> and <hi>Ciddi Ali</hi> by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral approbation, and conſent of the Souldiery joyntly ſucceeding him in that charge. But the ambition of theſe two young Gallants would admit no union in the Government; the Elder would know no equal, and the younger no ſuperior, ſo that it was neceſſary for one to govern, or both to be laid aſide: the deciſion of which was referred to a full Aſſembly of the <hi>Turks.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Hoffſey-bey</hi> Brother to <hi>Morat</hi> deceaſed, and Uncle to the two Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors, taking advantage of theſe diviſions, offered himſelf a Candidate for the place; and ſo operated with the force of mony, and with aſſiſtance of the younger Nephew who would rather yield to an Uncle, then to a brother, that he clearly carried the election by the common ſuffrages of the people. The Elder Son <hi>Ciddi Mehmet</hi> not enduring the indignity to be thus degraded took the field and ſet up his ſtandard; After him followed all his Fathers Old <hi>Spahees</hi> and the <hi>Moors</hi> abroad came into him, ſo that in a few days he became ſo formidable as to give Laws to the <hi>Dei</hi> and People of <hi>Tunis;</hi> obliging them immediately to baniſh his Uncle, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as ſole, and abſolute General of all the Land Souldiery in thoſe Dominions <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> not being able to reſiſt this force,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:39539:127"/>poſted away with ſuch expedition that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to embark himſelf, retinue and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (which as was reported being modeſtly calculated, amounted to three millions of Dollars) on no better a Veſſel, then a <hi>French Satte</hi> for <hi>Tripoli;</hi> where he was honourably received by that Government, and Letters ſent from them to the young <hi>Bei</hi> at <hi>Tunis,</hi> mediating for the return of his Uncle, with promiſe, that he ſhould live quietly, and give no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to the courſe of his Government; but <hi>Ciddi Mehmet</hi> reſolving not to truſt him, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively declared againſt his readmiſſion, as not conſiſtent with his Government, and Safety.</p>
                     <p>It happened at this time that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had War with <hi>Tripoly,</hi> and blocked up the Port; and that afterwards a Peace enſuing; <hi>(Hoffſe-bey)</hi> (as we ſaid before,) ſhowed himſelf very forward, and zealous in the Mediation; which taking effect; he was afterwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his retinue tranſported on the <hi>Briſtol Fregat</hi> Commanded by Sir <hi>John Berry</hi> to <hi>Modon</hi> in the <hi>Morea,</hi> from whence he went by Land to carry his Complaints to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> whilſt the <hi>Briſtol Fregat</hi> proceeded to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to receive the <hi>Turky</hi> Companies Ships under Convoy for <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hoffſ-bey</hi> being arrived at the Grand Signiors Court prepared an eaſie and ready acceſs to the Grandees, by the great Preſents, he ſent them; which being the only means to mollify and make tender the hearts of <hi>Turks;</hi> he found upon all his addreſſes ſuch reſentments, and compaſſionate feelings of his aggreivances that if aſſurances in words, and promiſes would do his work, he might be aſcertained of engaging the entire power, and puiſſance of the Empire for his re-eſtabliſhment. The news of <hi>Hoffſe-bey;</hi> being gone to addreſs himſelf to the Turkiſh Court for relief much perplexed the Government at <hi>Tunis;</hi> and at the ſame time the plague deſperately raging there, made them ſick, and infirm both in body, and mind: wherefore after ſerious conſiderations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates hereupon; it was concluded neceſſary, to Fight <hi>Hoffſe</hi> with his own Weapons; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to diſpatch away four Ships for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with Meſſengers, and Preſents to the Grand Signior and his Officers being the only means to open the reaſons and underſtandings of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and make them as well capable to comprehend the juſtice of their cauſe, as to reconcile their affections. The four Ships arriving at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> were ſeized on, at the inſtance of <hi>Hoffſe-bey;</hi> and he declaring, that thoſe Ships were belonging to him, and his own proper Eſtate, eaſily procured a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his favour; and the Captains of them being called to the <hi>Divan,</hi> were Commanded to own <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> for their Maſter, and to obey him as their Paſha, and abſolute Lord under the Grand Signior. It was too late, when at <hi>Tunis</hi> they apprehended the Error, they had Committed, in ſending theſe four Ships to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> which now upon more ſerious conſideration then the former they expected to return freighted with armed Men, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Commands to re-eſtabliſh <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> in the Government of which, and of what was farther preparting at the Ottoman Court, that they might have good advice; they diſpatched two Meſſengers for <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on a French <hi>Satee,</hi> which they had freighted for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to Land them at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> where being arrived they addreſſed themſelves to me, then Conſul there, bringing me Letters of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation from friends at <hi>Tunis</hi> to aſſiſt and help them in all their occurences. I was well informed in all particulars concerning the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and motions of <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> and I did not omit to relate all matters diſtinctly to them; for not long before, I had occaſion to be acquainted with <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having at his earneſt requeſt found means to furniſh him with the Sum of three thouſand Dollars, upon a good Pawn of Gold, and Jewels; amongſt which there was a Fetlock of Gold enameled, and ſet with Diamonds, juſt in the form and faſhion of thoſe, which we put on our horſes, when they go to graſs; and this, I underſtood, was one of the Ornaments, which they put on the Ancle of the Bride on the marriage day; I know not whether it were to grace her legs, as bracelets do our wriſts, or to put her in mind of her ſervitude, ſo ſoon as ſhe ſubmits to Wedlock. I acquainted them, as I ſaid, with all matters: That the Grand Signior, and his Officers, had greatly reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſufferings of <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> and that they own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his cauſe, having ſtopt the four Ships of <hi>Tunis</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and had promiſed to furniſh him with a whole Chamber of Janiſaries, with a Licence to raiſe ſuch Voluntiers on the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as would willingly, and of their own accord follow his Colours. I had not many days given them this intelligence, which others confirmed in like manner; before <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> himſelf with his four men of War and two other hired Ships arrived in the Port of <hi>Smyrna:</hi> where having ſtayed ſome days to taken in proviſions, and embark thoſe who had liſted themſelves for his ſervice in thoſe Parts; they departed for <hi>Tunis,</hi> touching at <hi>Scio, Navarine,</hi> and <hi>Tripoly,</hi> in their Way, reinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing themſelves with ſuch, as voluntarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their Standard. The Meſſengers poſted back with all ſpeed, on a Veſſel hired at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> and arriving ſome time before <hi>Hoffſe-bey;</hi> ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered an account of the treatment which he had found at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with the particulars of the forces he brought with him. The <hi>Tuneſines</hi> being prepared with this intelligence, took courage to oppoſe a handful of men, to whom they refuſed Licenſe ſo much as to one man of them to land; only out of reſpect to the Grand Signior's Commands, they were willing to admit <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> to a treaty; and to receive him aſhoar with three or four Servants and COmpanions; They ſleightly peruſed his Papers, rather to diſcover his ſtrength, and the porgreſs of his negotiations, then with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to condeſcend in the leaſt to his deſires; which having done, and given permiſſion to ſee his houſe, and viſit his wife, and children; they haſtned him again aboard; and all the Country being in Arms, they threatned to treat him and his People, as Enemies, if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to make a deſcent. <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> being diſcouraged with this rude Treatment, and with the Union, and general Confederacy of the people againſt him contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; returned to <hi>Navarine;</hi> where he landed, diſcharged his Ships, and Souldiers, which lay too heavy upon a Private Purſe, and retired himſelf for ſome time with much melancholy and diſcontent; at length he travelled again to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where the Turkiſh Officers at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:39539:127"/>his coming with open mouths, expecting to ſhare once more in the recruits he had brought with him from <hi>Tunis.</hi> But his ſtock being low, he was not able to diſpenſe his mony, and preſents ſo generouſly, and plentifully as before; which the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving fell much in their reſpects for him, and ſtrangly on a ſuddain loſt wholly the zeal and compaſſion for his cauſe; ſuffering him to live at <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> in the Condition of a private Aga. In the mean time the diſturbances, and civil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions ran high at <hi>Tunis:</hi> the two Brothers waging War with various and interchangeable ſucceſs, cauſed ſuch agitions in the State, that in three months time four <hi>Deys</hi> were cut off. At length the younger Brother <hi>Ciddi Ali</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victory, and always inclining towards his Uncle, conſented that he ſhould be recalled from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> whereupon four Ships were fitted at <hi>Porto Farina,</hi> to carry preſents of atonement to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and to bring <hi>Hoffſe-bey</hi> from thence with Title of Paſha; whom the people now, expected with great impatience, as the only Perſon, whoſe Preſence and Authority was able to ſettle, and reſtore them to their former quietneſs and union. This happened in the year 1677; when the Country was ſo harraſſed with Civil Wars, that a miſerable Famine enſued; ſo that a Cafficé of Wheat which was ten Buſhels, was ſold for twenty eight Dollars, and of Barly for fourteen: and the ſcarcity of this Country which is commonly the Granary of <hi>Italy,</hi> had ſuch influence on thoſe parts and <hi>Spain,</hi> in the years 1677 and 1678 that the Sate of the Grand Duke of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> ſuffered much thereby; and had more, had not the State of <hi>Luca</hi> out of Friendſhip, and on the ſcore of Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood relieved their neceſſities.</p>

                     <p>PRopoſitions of peace not being ſo earneſtly preſſed, nor ſo advantageouſly proffered by the Poles, as the pride of the Turks did expect, the War ſtill continued, but not proſecuted either on the one ſide or on the other with the ſame violence with which it began. For the Sultan deſigning this year to circumciſe his Son, the young Prince, now about twelve years of Age, and to marry his Daughter of ſeven to his Moſayp, or Favourite, Paſha of <hi>Magnaſia,</hi> commonly called by the Name of <hi>Kul-ogli,</hi> which ſignifies the Son of a Slave, he reſolved todedicate this whole Year to quiet repoſe, mirth, and jollity at home, only two thouſand Janiſaries were ſent to <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha to recruit the Souldiers on the Frontiers of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Tartars were reinforced with ſome Turkiſh Troops under <hi>

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania;</hi> And the Captain Paſha, with twenty eight Sail of Gallies, was diſpeeded into the Black Sea for carrying of ſuch Proviſions and Ammunition for War as was neceſſary for ſupply of the Army: Beſides which, no preparations of War were deſigned, theſe being judged ſufficient, though not to conquer, yet at leaſt to repreſs the Incurſions, and amuſe or keep the Armes of the Enemy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
                     <p>For at the Cttoman Court the ſace of all things was become ſerene and calm, no Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos of great men, nor diſcontents of the people, nor balck and cruel deſigns of State diſturbed, or clouded the ſplendour of the Solemnities,<note place="margin">The happy ſtate of the Ottoman. Court.</note> or the brows of the great Statiſts, but all matters ran in an uninterrupted courſe of Joy and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivity. The Sultan, who in his action ſhewed himſelf a moſt benign Prince, ſparing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate of the blood and miſery of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, hath, ſince his arrival to a mature Age, exerciſed a wiſe manner of Government, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and juſt, and yet void of the cruelty and tyranny of his Anceſtors; under whom the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chriſtian enjoyed the privilege of their Capitulations with more juſtice, and leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Avanias. The Vizier alſo, and other great Officers, being ſenſible of the benefit which Trade begat, treated Merchants with more gentleneſs and reſpect than in former times, their Ships not being forced on every occaſion into the Grand Signior's ſervice, but rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to it by rewards and fair promiſes, otherwiſe than in the times of former Viziers, and it is to be wiſhed alſo that the like might be ſaid under the Government of thoſe which are to ſucceed; though if we look forward to the years 1678 and 1679 we ſhall find the Scene of things altered, and not only Merchants, but even Ambaſſadors, and the Repreſentatives themſelves, remain under ſad diſcouragements, Amongſt theſe joys and gentle ways of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the manner of this Court was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; the Divan had not for two months ſpace been opened for buſineſs, to the great prejudice and interruption of Juſtice; Wine, that great abomination to the Turkiſh Law, which four years paſt was by the Imperial Decree forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under pain of Death and a thouſand Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecrations and Curſes, was now the common Drink, and divertiſement in faſhion, uſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately by all, excepting the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, the Mufti, and Reis Effendi; the Vizier himſelf having been exceſſively intemperate therein, had extinguiſhed the natural heat of his ſtomach, which could be warmed by no leſs heat than what proceeds from <hi>Aqua Vitae;</hi> by which debauchery and indiſpoſition all Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes were ſlowly and negligently diſpatched, and according to his example the Officer and Miniſters acted in their Affairs, which in former times being always, diſpatched by nine a Clock in the Morning, that became now the time and hour of riſing.</p>
                     <p>The Grand Signior himſelf, though not taught by his Attendants to drink Wine, leſt it ſhould perhaps betray him to ſome actions dangerous to them, gave himſelf to Amours; for falling in love with a Poliſh Woman, lately captivated at <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> he made her his Second Haſakee or Sultaneſs; for having had the good fortune to bring him a Son, that honour was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of her fruitfulneſs; and that he might give other teſtimonies of his favour, he caſt his eyes on a poor Chinganee, or Gipſy Boy, who with ſinging and dancing ſo pleaſed him, that he gave him ſix purſes of money containing three thouſand Dollars, with Horſes and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and took him into the Seraglio. Amidſt theſe Delights the Grand Signior gave order to the Vizier not to ſpeak to him of three things: Neither of returning to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> nor againſt his Favourite, nor againſt his Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in other matters he might uſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:39539:128"/>
                     <p>Another alteration of a better nature, with reference to Learning and Knowledge, ſeems alſo remarkable in this Court; for the Grand Signior having been ſome years paſt preſented by the Dutch Reſident, with twelves large Volumes of the new <hi>Atlas,</hi> upon an accidental ſight thereof was ſo pleaſed, that he commanded it ſhould ſpeedily be tranſlated into Turkiſh; to which Work Dr. <hi>Alexandro Mauro Cordato,</hi> the Viziers Interpreter, who ſucceeded in the place of <hi>Panaioti</hi> deceaſed, was nominated; but he finding it too unweildy for him, deſired the aſſiſtance of a French Jeſuit, then at <hi>Scio,</hi> skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Turkiſh and Arabick Languages, who was immediately ſent for, and therein employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and though it is thought, that this buſineſs is above their Element, and that it will ſoon cool and be neglected, yet it ſeems to be the firſt ſtep which the Turks have made unto Learning, and therefore is the more obſervable.</p>
                     <p>And now the Feſtivals beginning on the <hi>16th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The great Feſtivals in what manner celebrated at the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Court.</note> we muſt for ſome days lay aſide all buſineſs, and obſerve with what order and form theſe Solemnities were performed. In the firſt place. On this day the Grand Signior, with the young Prince his Son, went to their Tents, which were pitched very ſumptuouſly in the Plain near the City, and indeed were truly ſtately and magnificent; all the great men, as the Vizier, Mufti, and others, having their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions erected; amongſt which was raiſed a very ſtately Throne, with a Canopy of Cloth of Gold, extended under the ſhady leavineſs of two tall Elms, which, ſet off with many Lamps, in the Night repreſented a very pleaſant and glorious Scene. On this Seat of State the Sultan placed himſelf in the morning, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied thither by all the Paſhaws then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and by the Rrepreſentatives of thoſe who were abſent; who according to their Degree, in order kiſſing his Veſt, delivered in a Silk Purſe, a Note or Schedule of their Preſents, which were afterwards put into the Tefterdar's or Lord Treaſurers hands to ſee and compare them with the particulars received; which were ſo great and conſiderable, that they far ſurpaſſed the Charges and Disburſments of the Solemnity. Oppoſite to the Tents were ſeveral poles fixed, between which at Night were hung Lamps of ſeveral ſhapes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing varied every Night made a very pleaſing and magnificent Object; by light of which in the Evening were exerciſed ſeveral tricks of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as Wreſtlings, Dancing, and Singing, and ſometimes were acted Turkiſh Comedies, which conſiſt only of Farces, and ſome ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Dialogues, and at laſt the divertiſements of the night concluded with Fire-works, which were ſo many, that (as reported) 240 men were employed for four months time in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Chriſtendom; only one ſeemed to excel the reſt, being a ſort of Rocket, which went up very high, without any tail of fire, like the common ones, carrying only a ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted Globe of red fire like a Star, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to noiſe in mounting, but raiſed to its height, breaks. Theſe were the paſtimes of the Night; in the day time all the ſeveral Arts and Trades, ſome one day, and ſome another, paſſed before the Tents, every one offering their Preſents, as they paſſed, repreſenting by ſome kind of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant and Proceſſion their diverſities of Trade: this continued for fifteen days. On the <hi>25th.</hi> of this inſtant <hi>May,</hi> was a ſolemn Cavalcade, in which marched the Janiſaries with all their chief Officers, Chiauſes, and Mutafaracas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And of the Great Men, the Vizier, Mufti, and <hi>Kul-ogli</hi> the Favourite, the firſt on the right hand, and the ſecond in the middle; after them followed the young Prince who was to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, extraodinary rich in the Furniture of his Horſe, and the number and largeneſs of the Diamonds, which were on his Tulbant and Breaſt. In this Cavalcade were carried twenty four ſmall Nachils, and two large ones, as high as the Maſt of a Ship, which were carried by a hundred Slaves, and ſet before the Seraglio, which are in form of triumphant Pyramids, adorned with Tinſils in thirteen Diviſions, according to this following Form or Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription.</p>

                     <p>On the <hi>27th.</hi> being the day of <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Birth, the Grand Signior rode publickly to the Moſch of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> having no other atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance than the Retinue of his own Court; his Pages were very rich in Cloth of Gold, each carrying a Feather ſtudded with a rich Jewel on his Head; after the Grand Signior rode the young Prince, who that Night was circumciſed. During this Feſtival, a vaſt number of people was fed at the charge of the Grand Signior, and about two thouſand circumciſed, every one of which had a Quilt given him, with a ſmall pay of three Aſper a day for his Life.<note place="margin">The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Marriage of the Grand Signior's Daughter.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Solemnity for the Circumciſion being ended, on the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> began the Feaſt for the Marriage. The Kuzlir Aga, who is the black Eunuch of the Women, was Bridegroom or Comparé to the young Princeſs, and the Tef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdar or Lord Treaſurer to <hi>Kul-ogli,</hi> both which in the name of the Bride and Bridegroom went before the Lord Chief Juſtice called the Kadeleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and by him had the Articles of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age wrote, and paſſed into publick Act; which being done, the Preſents were ſent, and firſt thoſe from the Bridegoom to the Bride, which were theſe, a great number of Beaſts and Birds ill-favouredly made in Sugar, thirty Mules la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with two Cheſts of Sweet-meats a piece, and about their necks each carried a Veſt of Sattin for the Muletiers, then were carried a great many Pots of Sherbet, then an hundred and twelve men carrying Veſts of Silk, Cloth, Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet, and Cloth of Gold, ſome had three, ſome five or ſix at leaſt wrapt up in Linen; then went five Horſes, one with rich Furniture; then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a noble Veſt of Cloth of Gold lined with Sables and nine Buttons and Loops on a ſide embroidered with large Pearl, on the top of which on the one ſide was a very large Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and on the other a Saphire, with Shoes, Boots, and Pattents for the Bagno, all covered with Pearl; likewiſe two Dreſſing-boxes, with Looking-glaſſes, and a Cap in form of a Crown, a little Cabinet embroidered all over with Pearl, eight Girdles ſet with Emeralds, Rubies, and Diamonds, a large Diamond-ring, a pair of Pendants of two great Emeralds, with many other particulars, which in paſſage were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be remembred.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Preſents being thus performed on the part of the Bridegroom to his Bride, the next Preſents concerned the Grand Signior to his Daughter, which were in place of her Dowry according to the cuſtom of the Eaſtern Countries: wherefore the <hi>19th.</hi> of this month the Preſents were uſhered with a moſt ſolemn Cavalcade of all the Grandees of the Court to the Houſe of the Bridegroom, which were two Gardens made of Sugar, forty little Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chils, eighty ſix Mules laden with Houſhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuſf, ten men with her Dreſſings, as Boots, Shoes, &amp;c. embroidered with Pearl as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; then were carried her Jewels ſet in Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, Bracelets, &amp;c. promiſcuouſly together, not in that rule as thoſe were which were ſent her by the Bridegroom. The Houſhold-ſtuff was made up with coverts, yet howſoever ſome parts were left open on the ſides, to ſhew that the Cuſhions were embroidered with Pearl, and others were of Velvet embroiderded with Gold. At laſt came twelve Coaches with Slaves and thirty ſix black Eunuchs. The <hi>23d.</hi> the Bride was conducted to her Bridegrooms Palace with a ſolemn Cavalcade, with two great Nachils of the ſame form and bigneſs as thoſe carried at the Cavalcade of the Prince, with two ſmaller ones of Silver. The Bride was ſeated in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Coach drawn with ſix Horſes, and cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Plates of Silver, and the ſides adorned with long Streamers of Tinſel: before which went the Kuzlit Aga or chief black Eunuch of of the Women: after followed four Coaches, with Six Horſes apiece, and twenty one more with four Horſes, each carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Eunuchs: than at ſome diſtance off came the Haſakee or Queen-Mother to the Bride in a Coach all covered with Plates of Silver, and attended with ten other Coaches more: the night following the Bride was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the Nuptial Chamber in ceremony only, ſhe not being yet ripe for conſummation of Marriage: all which Solemnity was attended at the Bridegrooms Court, with the ſame Sports and Fire-works which were made at the Tents, with an addition of dancing on the Ropes, and ſliding down a Rope faſtned to the top of the Steeple of the Moſch of Sultan <hi>Selim,</hi> which had like to have proved fatal to one who came down with a Boy at his back; for when he was about twenty yards from the ground, the Rope broke, but falling on a tree firſt, and then on a man, he was taken up with little hurt. The moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of all theſe Shows was a man that walked up a Rope as high asthe ſecond Balcony of the Menareh or Steeple of Sultan <hi>Selion,</hi> which is as high as commonly our Spire-Steeples are in <hi>England:</hi> And another hanging on a Rope with his hands, with his body extended, turned himſelf twelve times round with his hands: at all which Sight the Grand Signior was a conſtant Spectator. In this manner theſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemities ended, the Moſayp or Favourite rich in the eſteem of his Prince, and in high honour with all, had yet ſome allay to attemper and moderate his joy; for the Princeſs not yet fit for conſummation, in caſe ſhe dyed before that time, all her Jewels and Goods muſt return to the Grand Signior, notwithſtanding which he would be obliged to pay her Dowry, which was ſaid to be the Sum. of two years Revenue of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> but let it be what it will, he will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent, being, as reported, three hundred Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes already in debt. And now to demonſtrate the uncertainty of the Courts of Princes, as well as of all other places and conditions of the World, the Great Tefterdar or Treaſurer, who had for the ſpace of thirteen years managed this Office with ſingular induſtry and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was now removed from thence, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpecious ſhew of Preferment, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Dignity of Paſha of Grand <hi>Cairo:</hi> this change was the more wondered at, becauſe he was a Perſon ſo acute and ſo proper for the Office,<note place="margin">The Tefter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar put out of his Office.</note> that no man that held the place did ever manage it with greater reputation, nor with greater benefit to the Intereſt of his Prince; for beſides his good husbandry in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he was ſo skilful in knowing the price of Commodities, and ſo near in making his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, that the Merchant could ſcarce live by him, which in that conſumption of Goods made in the Seraglio, will produce a conſiderable abatement when all things are bought at the beſt hand; conſidering which, many reaſons were alledged, and conjectures made of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval: ſome ſaid, That the Grand Signior having a liking to a young Man of his, to prevent his being taken into the Seraglio, the Tefter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:39539:130"/>gave him a Wife, and thereby greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed the Grand Signior, as if he had purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrived it, to defeat his deſires: others ſaid, That the Grand Signior would have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed money of him to pay the Arrears of the Spahees, which he refuſed to lend: but others talked, and that with beſt reaſon, That <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> the old Chimacam, who is always with the Grand Signior, had found an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to repreſent him amiſs, ſuggeſting, that the Tefterdar ſhould ſay, That want of money in the Treaſury was cauſed by the vaſt Sums conſumed in the fooleries of the late Feaſts:<note place="margin">Ways for raiſing Money.</note> and the Vizier, though he entertained no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal animoſity againſt him, yet was willing to ſacrifice him to the friendſhip of <hi>Kara Muſtapha.</hi> And ſo being diſpoſſeſſed of his Office, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſucceeded the Janiſary <hi>Efendi</hi> or Judge-Advocate of the Janiſaries, a great Drinker of Wine, and one not to hold any compariſon with the parts and abilities of his Predeceſſour. Money now wanting greatly in the Treaſury, ſeveral ways were ſought to bring it in, and to ſave expences. The firſt of which was, that a review be made of all Otoraks, ſuch as <hi>Milites emeriti,</hi> who are excuſed from the War, and yet receive their pay; from which number thoſe were excluded who had bought it, or were not come legally by it, which would ſave the Grand Signior a vaſt Sum of Money yearly: and to help at this time of need, the late Treaſurer muſt refund and eaſe himſelf of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, before he enters on that rich and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Office of Grand <hi>Cairo.</hi> And <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Aga the chief Cuſtomer, who was a man that had inriched himſelf by many bad ways and arts, was diſplaced from his Office, and cauſed to diſgorge great Sums of Money to add unto the Supplies of the Treaſury. He was a Perſon of a ſubtle diſpoſition, raiſed from the mean degree of a Shoemaker, and being well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both with good and bad ways of gaining money, was a proper Inſtrument for the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Government, it being his fortune to fiſh riches rather for others than himſelf. And now being deprived of his Office and the beſt part of his Wealth, he reſolved, like all other diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Miniſters, to take a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> and to that end made a ſolemn Viſit to the Paſha of <hi>Cairo,</hi> then in his Tents near <hi>Scutari,</hi> acquainting him of his intentions to wait on him, and perform his Reſpects in his paſſage to the Holy <hi>Keblech</hi> or <hi>Mecha.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Turks have not of late years been very prodigal of the blood of their Subjects, nor have thoſe Executions been done of late on any Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, unleſs his Tyranny and Oppreſſion of the people did juſtly draw due puniſhment upon himſelf. And ſuch was the caſe of the Kahya or Secretary of the Chimacam or Governour in the Viziers abſence of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who taking on himſelf the management of all the Affairs of his Maſter, acted every thing according to his own pleaſure; for finding that whatſoever he did or propounded, was always confirmed and aſſented unto by his eaſie Lord, he aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a boldneſs to undertake any thing upon the proffers of mony, ſo the Sum was in any manner agreeable to the greatneſs of the matter required,<note place="margin">The Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> his Steward cut off.</note> or to the danger he incurred; by which means he involved his careleſs and unwary Maſter in ſuch intrigues, as could have no excuſe beſides his own ſupineneſs, and the corruptneſs of his Servant. At this manner of adminiſtring Juſtice, the people being diſcontented, haſtened the removal of the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam: and now another entring on the Office, the Kahya remained expoſed to the malice and complaints of all his Enemies, amongſt which none was of greater force than an accuſation laid againſt him, for having granted leave to the Armenian Chriſtians at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> for a Sum of Money to erect a Church; for which, though a Command was granted by the Great Vizier, obtained at a good price, to build one there of Timber, but of a low and mean Fabrick; yet the Kahya for a greater Sum of twenty Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Money, or ten thouſand Dollars, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved this Command, and changed their Materials from Timber to Stone and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: the which Building beginning to riſe with ſome magnificence, offended the neighbouring Turks with ſo much ſcandal, that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them carried the Complaints thereof to the Grand Signior; who calling the Vizier, and examining the Caſe, the Vizier would own no other Command, than for repairing of an old Church, but not building one new. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Sentence of Death being paſſed on the Kahya, an Officer was ſent to execute it. And in his way to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> at a place called <hi>Selebrea,</hi> meeting with the Offender, he cauſed him to return again with him to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where haveing ſtrangled him, his Body was thrown into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>We have thus far diſcourſed of the Affairs at home, which conſiſted for the moſt part in jollities and divertiſements; let us now look on the enterprizes and attempts abroad, and we ſhall find no great matter of action this year per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> more than ſome incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made into <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> by the Turks and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars under the Conduct of <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha, in which we have no Battels, nor great Skirmiſhes to recount, only a ſeizure or ſurprize of thoſe Coſacks, which were not under the juriſdiction of <hi>Doroſensko,</hi> who like ſheep were driven from their paſtures, and Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren carried away into Captivity, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into Countries, where they might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerve the purpoſes and deſigns of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire; to which ends alſo vaſt numbers of Tartars with their Families, were called to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit the circumjacent parts of <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> for better ſecurity of the Conqueſt, to which the Tartars moſt willingly concurred, eſteeming it a happy Bargain to exchange the Soil of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> for the fruitful Plains, and more gentle Air of <hi>Poland.</hi> And thus we may conſider what the inteſtine Diſcord of the Poles hath brought upon themſelves; that they, who in former days maintained their honour and reputation with the Turks, beyond any of the bordering Nations; not having every ſuffered them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their Country, much leſs to ſojourn or poſſeſs one palm of Ground therein; can now more eaſily ſee them before the Walls of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis</hi> or <hi>Cracovia,</hi> and planted in the very Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of their Countrey, rather than a King of their own Countrey ſet over them not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their own humour and fancy; or perhaps rather than behold the envied exaltation of ſome perſons to dignity, or ſome little diſorders in their Government; of which the Turk knows well to make uſe, it being no new Leſſon for him, to profit himſelf of the Diſcord and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities of the Chriſtians.</p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:39539:130"/>
                     <p>In like manner the Marine Affairs of the Turks this year afforded little worthy of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs it were, That the Captain Paſha was employed with about thirty Sail of Gallies into the Black Sea, for tranſporting of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and Proviſions to thoſe Forces in <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia;</hi> but he returned not with an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gallies, with which he departed, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt five of them by ſtorm, and then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> called by the Greeks the Feaſt of St. <hi>Demetrius,</hi> and by the Turks <hi>Caſſin-gheun,</hi> a day which is commonly remarkable for Storms at Sea; of which the Turks and Greeks are ſo aprehenſive or ſuperſtitious, that on that day or near that time, either before or after, until the ſtorm hath vented its fury, and taken its courſe, they will not adventure themſelves unto the Sea, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt preſſing occaſion, or hopeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>And here I judge it requiſite to conclude this Year with two matters very obſervable relating unto Trade: The firſt is with reference unto the Genoueſes, who in the Year 1666. firſt ſent their Ambaſſador Signior <hi>Durazzo,</hi> with many Preſents and great Magnificence to conclude a Peace with the Ottoman Empire, with the ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and intention of Trade; which having been eſtabliſhed on no other foundation at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, than that of their Temins,<note place="margin">The Trade of <hi>Genoua.</hi>
                        </note> and the Fabrick of their own Cloth, when the firſt failed, as it did in two years after, and that their Cloth turned not to account, but was out-ſold by the Engliſh and Dutch, then their Trade began to decay, or rather never came to perfection, like the fruit of a young tree, which buds fairly, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fruit, but hath not ſtrength to digeſt or bring it to maturity: Even ſo it was with the Genou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſes, who having been at the charge of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour Extraordinary, and ſetled a Reſident at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and a Conſul at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and all the other Formalities of Trade, wanted that nouriſhment thereof from their own ſoil, which produces the true and natural fruit of Commerce, which is gain and profit; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out-done by other Nations in ſhipping, there could little or no benefit be expected from their own Navigation in the Levant. For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, their Trade failing, the Duties of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulage on Goods appointed to maintain the Officers, and defray the publick Expences, were conſequently wanting; ſo that the Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> Reſident for that Republick at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> finding himſelf in great diſtreſſes and neceſſities, and unable to maintain himſelf and his Attendants agreeable to his Character and Quality, often adviſed his Prince and the Senate of the unhappy ſtate of their Affairs, deſiring from them either to provide a Supply agreeable to the occaſions, or to recal him from that Office, where he could no longer live in that Honour required. This importunity produced the exchange of Officers, and the Miſſion of Signior <hi>Giuſtiniano</hi> to reſide at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and Signior <hi>Gentile</hi> at <hi>Smyrna;</hi> the firſt of which, ſome few days after his arrival, being unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately killed with a Carabine in his Chamber at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as before related, the Office of Reſident came to be ſtill continued in the perſon of <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> who remaining without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions neceſſary to maintain his degree, and the annual Preſents expected by the Turks, which they eſteem as due as their Income, and as part of their Revenues, was forced to take up money on Pawns, and his own Credit at the Intereſt of 20, 25, or 30 <hi>per cent.</hi> according as his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities increaſed; and the apprehenſions men conceived of an inſufficiency and hazard in their ſecurity, was the cauſe that the debt, which in the beginning was inconſiderable, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing with Intereſt upon Intereſt, came at length to the Sum of ſixty or ſeventy thouſand Dollars, which the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing in a great meaſure to the ill Conduct of <hi>Fieſchi,</hi> and judging the greateſt part of this debt to be feigned, ſent another Reſident called Signior <hi>Spinola</hi> to ſucceed him in his Office, who arriving at <hi>Smyrna</hi> in the month of <hi>May</hi> of this preſent year, on a ſtout Ship hired of the Venetians, and under the notion of a Man of War accompanied with a Merchant Ship, and a new Conſul (the old one dying the year before) ſetled there ſuch Orders, as were judged neceſſary for the government of their Affairs. But before theſe Genoueſes arrived, a report had fore-ran them from <hi>Ligorne</hi> and other parts, that their Ships brought great quantities of falſe Gold and falſe Pieces of Eight: the which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ears of the Turks, Commands were provided againſt their arrival to ſearch their Ships, and try their Monies; to which the Genoueſes not condeſcending, Arz or teſtimony was made thereof by the Kadi unto the Grand Signiors Court. In the interim whilſt this Arz went up, and the anſwer expected, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noueſe Reſident deſigning to proceed forward on his Voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> demanded the Kadi's Moraſelau or Ticket of Licence for the Man of War on which he came, to paſs the Caſtle, (for that Ship had entred within the Port.) The Kadi judging it neceſſary, that both the Reſident and Ship ſhould attend the arrival of the anſwer from above, refuſed to grant this Licence; whereupon the Reſident all in a rage imbarked himſelf, and immediately ſet ſail, and having a fair Breez out of the Port, gently ſlided along by the ſide of the Caſtle without any ſtop or interruption.</p>
                     <p>This affront being put upon the Kadi, greatly diſpleaſed him; ſo that calling the Lieutenant and Gunner of the Caſtle into queſtion, and not admitting of their Plea, that the Ship was a Man of War, and the perſon thereon a Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, both which were privileged, and both going up to the Grand Signiors Court, were to anſwer there for what was laid againſt them; but this I ſay, not being admitted for reaſon, the Kadi committed them both to Priſon, from whence with ſome charge afterwards they relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The new Reſident being arrived at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> the Creditors of Count <hi>Fieſchi</hi> demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed payment of the debts owing to them, which was given in, to amout to ſixty thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſo much was to be paid before <hi>Fieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi</hi> ſhould be permitted to depart, or at leaſt that part thereof being ſatified in hand, the new Reſident <hi>Spinola</hi> ſhould give ſecurity for payment of the remainder: the which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to do, as not owning the accounts which <hi>Fieſchi</hi> had given in, in regard he judged them to be compoſed of extravagant Intereſts, and to ariſe on charges not allowable by that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, who after the death of <hi>Giu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:39539:131"/>Sequeſtration was laid on their Man of War; ſo that ſhe was toaed away to the Arſenal, and there laid up, and attached for payment of the debt: which ariſing on the account of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, the Goods of the Common-wealth was juſtly eſteemed liable to the Sequeſtration: dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time the Peſtilence, the Epidemical diſeaſe of that ſeaſon at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> affecting with its contagion the Ships company, about eighteen or twenty of them dyed thereof, and all their affairs reduced to a ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation.</p>
                     <p>In this interim many and various were the diſputes and conteſts between the two Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; ſometimes they propoſed to refer their differences to the deciſion of the Engliſh, French, and Venetian Miniſters; ſometimes again, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtance ſo wide and ſpatious between them, they reſolved to have their matters deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Turkiſh Sentence. At length the new Reſident perceiving no end of this buſineſs, and that the Ship lay ingaged at a great charge, and as it were captivated to the great diſhonour of the Republick, came to an agreement to pay thirty three thouſand Dollars, one third where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was to be paid in hand, and the other two thirds by equal portions in the ſpace of one year; the firſt payment to be made after ſix months, and the other ſix months after; to which not only the Reſident, but their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants alſo entred perſonally into obligation. In this manner the Ship being cleared, and taking ſuch Lading as offered for <hi>Genoua</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſailed for <hi>Smyrna;</hi> where taking another Ship of the ſame Country into her company, departed with the Dutch Convoy for Chriſtendom. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remained ſix months in Port, ſubjected to much charge and trouble, and not finding a Freight equal to the time and expence, was no great incouragement to the Genoueſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this Trade, which by good experience appears in no manner agreeable to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, nor yielding ſucceſs anſwerable to the long expectation of ten years paſt.</p>
                     <p>In this Year it was, that the Grand Signior and Great Vizier at the inſtigation of <hi>Chuſaein</hi> Aga the chief Cuſtomer (whom we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned) caſting their eyes on <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and finding it a place of a great Trade, and a convenient Port, for which in ancient times it was always famous, and for the ſame cauſe was frequented by Merchants both from the Eaſtern and Weſtern parts of the World; ſo that it was become the only great and conſiderable Mart or Scale within the Precincts of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Empire: conſidering it (I ſay) in this manner with a benign eye, as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great profit and advantage, they began to think it worthy the Ornament of ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Edifices, founded with that Magnificence as might endure long, and renew the ancient Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation of <hi>Smyrna:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A Beſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteen and new Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom-houſe, and a Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Chan built at <hi>Smyrna.</hi>
                        </note> Hereupon they erected in the firſt place a Beſaſteen, which is in the nature of our Exchange, where ſeveral Shops are made, and variety of Goods ſold; and to make the better Front towards the Sea, it was founded therein on vaſt Stones and Piles, fit to ſupport a weighty Building.</p>
                     <p>The next Edifice erected was a Cuſtom-houſe built into the Sea only on Piles of Timber, with a handſom Front towards the Sea; and this the Great Vizier judged to be a work not only neceſſary, but alſo agreeable to the Majeſty of his Maſter; for until this time the Cuſtomer lived in a hired Houſe not unlike the others which Merchants inhabit. And now this Houſe being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, a Hatteſheriff or Royal decree came down from the Court, commanding that all Ships that came into that Port either to lade or unlade, ſhould lay their ſides to that Cuſtom-houſe Scale, and thereon diſcharge their Goods, and receive others.</p>
                     <p>And now whereas the Merchants injoyed at all times in former days the convenience of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Goods landed on, and laden from their own Keys or Scales, they greatly reſented this innovation; and as they unwillingly quit any Priviledge, ſo they judged this not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be contended for with ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and reſolution: the commodiouſneſs of which was thought ſo conſiderable, that it not only cauſed this place in former days to flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and to be diſtinguiſhed from all the Marts in the World; but alſo the injoyment thereof invited the Inhabitants from the more elevated parts of <hi>Smyrna</hi> (where was health and pleaſure) to the lower Bogs and Mariſhes, exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing health and chearful air for profit and convenience of Commerce. Hereupon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications were made by all the Conſuls of the Frank Nations to their Ambaſſadours and Miniſters at the Grand Signiors Court. In the mean time Trade by common agreement was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted, at leaſt as to the lading or unlading of Ships, which continued for ſeveral days, and touched ſomewhat grievouſly the Engliſh and Dutch Nations: the firſt having two Ships, and the latter ſix Merchants-ſhips in Port. The Engliſh Ambaſſadour being then perſonally at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was the firſt who without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any other Miniſter, moved in this affair, but found great oppoſition in it from the Turkiſh Officers; who with ſome reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſent reluctancy of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, declared not without paſſion, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution the Grand Signior had to conform the honour of the Cuſtom-houſe in ſome ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance with thoſe of Chriſtian Princes; and therefore did wonder that the Chriſtian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants could ſo eaſily condeſcend to the rules of thoſe Cuſtom houſes in their own Countries, where they were Natives, and yet could not ſupport the ſame in theſe parts where they were Aliens and Strangers. And as a farther evidence of the Turks reſolution to maintain this point, it was ſaid by the Vizier's Kahya, that the Grand Signior was reſolved to blow up both Port and Town, rather than not be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his own Dominions; with this Anſwer, Merchants deſpairing of the ſucceſs, began to unlade their ſhips at the Cuſtom houſe, or to give an account there of the Goods in their Boats; for the Cuſtomer was become ſenſible, there was not ſufficient Water for ſhips to ride at the Key of the Cuſtom houſe, and did alſo indulge unto the Merchants ſeveral other particulars herein, that ſo the innovation might ſit the more lightly on them, which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was ſo ill reſented and taken to heart. And this was the firſt beginning in the Months of <hi>Auguſt</hi> and <hi>September,</hi> when this priviledge was taken from the Merchants. And in this Year alſo the Great Chan next to the Beſaſteen was in Building, and the firſt Foundation thereof laid, and the great Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct brought from the Plains of <hi>Bogiaw,</hi> and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Harchi-bonar.</hi>

                     <p>At the end of the year 1674, we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the beginning proceedings, and concluſion
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:39539:131"/>of the War, which our Gracious King was pleaſed in defence of his Subjects, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce to make on <hi>Tripoly;</hi> which we brought down to this year 1676; when Sir <hi>John Narbrough</hi> Sailing home for <hi>England,</hi> touched in his way at <hi>Algiers,</hi> for better underſtanding of the State of all matters with that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Things had for ſome time remained in a doubtful condition between <hi>England,</hi> and that people; who having lately proved the ſmart effects of War with us, were not very forward to make a breach. Howſoever it being that time, when by means of a General Peace, which we enjoyed with all the World, and of a War in which the reſt of Chriſtendom was involved, that our navigation flouriſh'd, and that few other Ships beſides <hi>Engliſh</hi> paſſed the Seas; the <hi>Algerines</hi> grew weary of a Peace with us. And herein they ſeemed to have ſome more reaſon then uſual, becauſe that when it was their fortune to meet with ſtrangers, they were ſo diſguiſed with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, and Paſsports ſurreptitiouſly, and fraudulently procured, that they could not diſtinguiſh their Friends from Enemies, whereof they made frequent Complaints, and addreſſes to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The King out of a ſence of Juſtice, and a tender care of his Subjects welfare, knowing that ſuch indirect practiſes muſt neceſſarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a War was pleaſed by a Letter to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to ſignify his care in that particular, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling all Paſsports formerly given, promiſed a better regulation of them for the future; as appears by the Proclamation here following, which was incloſed, and ſent in the Letter to <hi>Algiers.</hi>

Others ſaid, that the Janiſaries and Militia murmured, and that his Coming to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was forced and not to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that the Sultan being now out of love with <hi>Adrianople,</hi> had curſed it, and ſworn never more to ſet foot in it, having ordered the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials ſent for the building of the Great Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> to be ſtopped on the way, and returned back again. At this rate all the World talked and diſcourſed, joy and hopes made the people fancy every thing according to their wiſhes. The Grand Signior being approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> fixed himſelf in his Camp in the Fields, near a ſmall Seraglio of his own, called <hi>Daout Baſha,</hi> from whence the people for many days expected, that he ſhould, according to the Cuſtom of his Anceſtors, make a ſolemn Entry; inſtead whereof he made ſome Salies with a ſmall Company through the Streets, as it were <hi>incognito,</hi> taking his paſtime on the Water, and on the ſides of the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> in his Gallies and Boats, but moſt commonly frequented his Place of <hi>Scutari</hi> on the Aſian ſide, where with much delight and confidence he lodged and repoſed his Court, but made no ſolemn Entry through the City, not frequented his great Seraglio; where though he might perhaps dine, and paſs certain hours, yet he ſlept not one Night there; of which the people took eſpecial notice, and thereby received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the jealouſie their Soveraign had of them, to their extraordinary grief and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction; however it was ſome contentment to the people, and renown unto the City to have their Emperour ſo near, though it was rumoured as if the Court towards the approach of Winter intended again to return unto <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople.</hi> In the mean time the Grand Signior took his chief delight and divertiſement on the Water, paſſing in his Gallies and Pleaſure-Boats up the <hi>Boſphorus</hi> to the mouth of the Black Sea; and thence returning, much frequented the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Houſes of Delight upon the Banks of the River; and viſiting all places, a Country Houſe called <hi>Therapea,</hi> belonging to the Dutch Reſident, received the honour of his Preſence, which he liked ſo well, that he took it from the Proprietor, and conferred it without any conſideration of money onone of his Courtiers, giving out a Proclamation, That no Chriſtian Miniſter ſhould poſſeſs any Seat or Habitation on the ſide of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> A ſtrange thing, and what is not to be paralleled in any part of the World.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of this Year the Captain Paſha died, and <hi>Zaid Ahmet</hi> Paſh-ogli, then at the Camp, ſucceeded him; his Father was a famous Man, and in the ſame Charge, but cut off by old <hi>Kuperlee.</hi> Soon after <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Paſha, General of the Army at <hi>Keminitz,</hi> likewiſe died, and his Office was conferred on <hi>Ibrahim Paſha,</hi> that was Paſha of <hi>Candia,</hi> of whom we have had often occaſion to ſpeak, being a great friend to the Engliſh Nation. The Great Vizier alſo was not far remote from the Confines of Death, being now fallen, by reaſon of immoderate drinking of Wine, and chiefly of hot Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Waters, into a formed Dropſie and Jaundice.</p>

                     <p>In the preceding year we touched on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Tefterdar or Treaſurer from his Office to the Government of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> and the reaſons for it, which though it might be a preferment (being the richeſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Charge of the Empire) to which the eſteem the Sultan had of his parts and abilites, might probably advance him; yet the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him at a diſtance ſo remote, was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an effect of ſome diſpleaſure, whereby he or his Favourites judged him a Perſon not fit to remain longer near the Royal Preſence. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having commenced his Journey (as before mentioned) he arrived at Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> where he had not long continued before he began, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the natural acuteneſs of his mind and hugſtering manner, to pierce with a narrow inſpection into all Affairs of that Government, and particularly into the Revenue and Treaſure of the Country, contriving with himſelf by what means the diſorders might be corrected, and the Revenue and Tribute improved; for he had an excellent Genius or Spirit in the matters of Money, nothing in advantage of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt could ever eſcape him; ſo that he began to lay a new foundation in all proceedings; he would not be contented with the old Taxes and Impoſitions, and where he found Lands im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, or the Cuſtoms augmented, he would put in for a ſhare of the Benefits, and would reform every thing wherein he judged his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to have been abuſed. But though he was acute and ſharp-ſighted in ſuch matters as theſe, yet he wanted experience in the Government of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for theſe great Beghs of this Country being alarmed with the innovations, began to ſtand upon their Guard, and to enter into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Conſultations, in what manner to oppoſe themſelves to this new way of Government, which looked like ſlavery, and deſigns of bringing them into ſervitude, and a ſubjection unknown to them and their Fore-fathers. For indeed the Government of <hi>Egypt,</hi> if well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, is rather Ariſtocratical than Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical; for though they acknowledge the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to be their Head, and accept his Paſha for Ruler, and pay a yearly Tribute, yet the Beghs which are great Lords in their reſpective Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, carry the ſway and Dominion in all other matters, and will endure nothing with favours of oppreſſion or innovation; ſo that theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons grown jealous by the proceedings of the new Paſha, flew into open Sedition, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Arms, with force of which they aſſaulted the Paſha's Palace, took him and threw him into Priſon. The News whereof flying with all haſte to the Ottoman Court, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the firſt apprehenſion or ſurpriſe as if all <hi>Egypt</hi> had revolted, and gave the World occaſion to diſcourſe, That the Wars were to be carried Eaſtward, and that the ſudden reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of removing the Court to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was in order to a farther March into thoſe parts. But frequent Meſſages with time making the buſineſs to be better underſtood, cauſed the Grand Signior to diſpeed with all haſte another Paſha, with Commiſſion to remove the former, and to continue all the ancient Cuſtoms and Priviledges from the beginning indulged to the Beghs of <hi>Egypt:</hi> with which Meſſage and gentle words of grace and favour from the Sultan, all diſcontents being pacified, the former Paſha was releaſed from his Impriſonment, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to depart, and thence proce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But here I muſt not forget a ſtory which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened during the time of this Summer, whilſt the Grand Signior had his abode and injoyed his Recreations in the circumjacent parts of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople;</hi> there was a certain Sultana which had been a caſt Wench of Sultan <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> who after his death, having been married to ſome Paſha, obtained her releaſe from the old Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, and being alſo a Widow by the death of this Husband, had liberty to take her habitation on the Banks of the <hi>Boſphorus,</hi> or where ſhe thought fit. This Lady was called <hi>Soltana Sporcha,</hi> in Turkiſh <hi>Modar:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Soltana Sporcha.</hi>
                        </note> how ſhe came to be ſo nominated I cannot tell, perhaps ſome Italian Pages of the Court might in reſpect to her way of living impoſe this Name upon her, for ſhe was no other than a Bawd, or ſomething worſe, making it her Profeſſion to buy young Girls, and to educate them in ſinging, dancing and in all the ways which beſt accompliſh Courtiſans. Amongſt this Train of Scholars, ſhe had one more brisk and aery than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which could ſing, and dance, and prate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably, and was ſo quick in her Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that ſhe greatly delighted the Paſha's and Lords, whoſe pleaſures ſhe atended, bringing from them conſiderable Gifts and Preſents to the enriching of her ſelf and Miſtreſs; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo much the talk of the Court, that at length the report of her arrived the cars of the Grand Signior, who being alſo deſirous to injoy ſome divertiſements by the pranks of this witty Girl, ſent to the Sultana one of the black Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs for her: which Imperial Command ſhe not daring to diſobey, conſigned her with great ſubmiſſion into the hands of the Meſſenger; but with this caution, that ſhe humbly deſired the Sultan not to make any attempt on her Chaſtity, in regard ſhe was both a Virgin and Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The grand Signior having pleaſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the wantonneſs of this Wench, began to take a fancy to her, and reſolved to take her into the Seraglio; but ſhe ſhewing a kind of nicety and coineſs, the Grand Signior, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was better accommodated, ſent her back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to her Miſtreſs, reflecting (as was ſuppoſed) with ſome diſguſt on the caution which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied her. It happened not long after, that this Girl exerciſing her Art in the preſence of ſome great Perſons, one <hi>Cheſmé</hi> Aga, a Boſnian by Nation, Captain of the Great Viſiers Guard, a ſtout and valiant man, happening to be a Spectator one night, became unfortunately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of her, and from that time not being able to remove the impreſſion ſhe had made in his heart, reſolved, if poſſible, to make her his Wife, and to that end made his affections known and his intentions of Marriage, both to her and to her Miſtreſs. The Girl was well enough pleaſed to become the Wife of ſo honourable a Perſon; but the Sultana unwilling to loſe the profit and benefit ſhe daily brought her in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the Match, declaring, That ſhe was a Slave, and not at her own diſpoſal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in no capacity of beſtowing her ſelf any way without her conſent. This impediment giving a ſtop to the Marriage, put the two Lovers on plots and contrivances in what manner to injoy each other, and Love being ingenious, quickly
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:39539:133"/>found out a means to bring them together; for the Girl eſcaping from her Miſtreſs, lodged her ſelf in thoſe Chambers which her Lover had found for her. And being now miſſed, none but <hi>Cheſmé</hi> Aga was charged with her, of whom ſhe complained to the Grand Signior, and cited him before his Maſter the Great Vizier to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for her; but he denying to know any thing of her, and no witneſs appearing againſt him, all farther proceedings were ſuperſeded for the preſent: But <hi>Soltana Sporcha</hi> keeping watchful ſpies upon all the motions of <hi>Cheſmé</hi> Aga, at length found him and his Miſtreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and by the Authority of Officers brought them both before the Vizier: to whom the Sultana ſent a rude meſſage, That <hi>Cheſme</hi> Aga ſhould be puniſhed, and that her Slave ſhould be returned. The Viſier hereof acquainted the Grand Signior, and gave him to underſtand the meſſage which the Sultana had ſent him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to know what puniſhment he was pleaſed ſhould be inflicted on them. In which interrim <hi>Cheſmé</hi> Aga told the Viſier, That he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no other than a ſentence of death from the Grand Signior, only he deſired that his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Miſtreſs might be ſpared, for he was ſure he ſhould live in her. It was not long before the fatal Decree came for putting <hi>Cheſmé</hi> Aga to death, and ſending the Woman to the Seraglio, which was immediately executed; which act might ſeem to denote a natural cruelty in the Sultan, being in reality very ſevere, though the whole courſe of his Reign hath been more gentle and mild than of any of the Ottoman Emperours; only this fact proceeded rather from diſdain than thirſt of blood, being angry that this Girl ſhould prefer the Love of one of his Vaſſals before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Seraglio, and that her Miſtreſs the Sultana ſhould charm him with a lye of her being free, when ſhe was no other than a ſlave, and not long before bought for an inconſiderable price.</p>
                     <p>Not long after this, and towards the <hi>11th,</hi> or <hi>12th,</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> when the Sun was come to the Equinoctial, the Grand Signior prepared to depart.<note place="margin">The Grand Signior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again to <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople.</hi>
                        </note> The rumour of which diſpleaſing and making ſad the people hearts, as much as his preſence before comforted them, it was given out, That the Grand Signior intended to return with the Spring, and divide the conſolation, which his reſidence produced, between the two Regal Cities, and for an evidence thereof, he ordered a Platform to be laid for erecting a new Seraglio at <hi>Scutari,</hi> and the Viſier deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at <hi>Bezick-raſh,</hi> and the Palaces of the Paſha's and great Men were all putting into a way of Reparation, which for ſome time amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contented the minds of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of <hi>October</hi> the Grand Signior ſet forward towards <hi>Adrianople,</hi> being accompanied with the Moſayp, which is his Favourite, and <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> who was his Chimacam, taking his recreation by the way in Hunting; but the Great Vizier <hi>Achmet</hi> Paſha continuing ſtill ſick of his Dropſie and Jaundice, took his Journey by Water as far as <hi>Selebra</hi> for his better eaſe, and thence proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Horſe litter to <hi>Churlu,</hi> which is the half-way to <hi>Adrianople,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Death of the Vizier <hi>Achmet.</hi>
                        </note> on the twenty third of <hi>October</hi> expired his laſt; his Diſcaſe, though heightned by Wine and hot Spirits, yet was in ſome part hereditary, his father dying of the Dropſie. His Body was on the twenty fifth brought back again in a Coach to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with a ſmall Attendance, and buried in the ſame Sepulchre with his Father. He was a Perſon (for I have ſeen him often,<note place="margin">His Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> and knew him well) of a midle ſtature, of a black beard, and brown complexion, ſomething ſhort-ſighted, which cauſed him to knit his brows and pore very intently when any ſtrange perſon entred to his preſence: he was inclining to be fat, and grew corpulent towards his latter days. If we conſider his age when he firſt took upon him this important Charge, the Enemies his Father had created him, the contentions he had with the <hi>Valede Sultana</hi> or the Queen-Mother, and the Arts he had uſed to reconcile the affections of theſe great Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, and conſerve himſelf in the unalterable eſteem of his Soveraign to the laſt hour of his death, there is none but muſt judge him to have deſerved the Character of a prudent and politick Perſon. If we conſider how few were put to death, and what inconſiderable Muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies or Rebellions happened in any part of the Empire during his Government, it will afford us a clear evidence and proof of his gentleneſs and moderation beyond the example of former times; for certainly he was not a Perſon who delighted in bloud, and in that reſpect of an humor far different from the temper of his Father; He was generous, and free from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice, a rare Vertue in a Turk! He was educated in the Law, and therefore greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to all the Formalities of it, and in the Adminiſtration of that ſort of Juſtice very pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and ſevere; He was very obſervant of the Capitulations between our King and the Grand Signior, being ready to do Juſtice upon any corrupt Miniſter, who pertinaciouſly viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tranſgreſſed them, of which I could give ſeveral inſtances, but theſe being improper for this place, are only in general to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with due gratitude in honour to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. As to his behaviour towards the neighbouring Princes, there may, I believe, be fewer examples of his breach of Faith, than what his Predeceſſors have given in a ſhorter time of Rule. In his Wars abroad he was ſucceſsful, having upon every expedition enlarged the Bounds of the Empire; He over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Newhawſel</hi> or <hi>Oywar,</hi> and laid thereunto a conſiderable part of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which to this day continues ſubject, and pays contribution to the Turk.</p>
                     <p>He concluded the War with <hi>Venice</hi> after twenty ſeven years continuance, by an intire and total ſubjection of the Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> having ſubdued that impregnable Fortreſs, which by the reſt of the World was eſteemed invincible.</p>
                     <p>He won <hi>Kemenitz,</hi> the Key of <hi>Poland,</hi> where the Turks had been frequently baffled, and laid <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> to the Empire; reducing the Coſacks, thoſe mortal Enemies, to ſubjection, and to a deſire of taking on them the Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Yoke: and finally, he impoſed a new Tribute on all <hi>Poland.</hi> After all which Glories he dyed in the <hi>47th</hi> year of his Age, and <hi>15th</hi> year and <hi>8th</hi> day of his Government; a ſhort time, if we conſider it, for ſuch great actions; howſoever, if we meaſure his triumphs, rather than count his years though he might ſeem to have lived but little to his Prince and People, yet certainly to himſelf he could not dye more ſeaſonable, nor in a greater height and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency

                     <p>The Great Vizier having in this manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired his laſt breath, the Seal was immediately carried by his Brother to the Grand Signior, who upon Receipt thereof, according to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expectation, conferred the ſame on <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> Paſha, who had for ſo many years formerly exerciſed the Office of Chimacam,<note place="margin">Kara Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtapha <hi>made Vizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
                        </note> which is as much as Deputy to the Great Vizier, of whom in other places we gave a Character of being a wiſe and experienced Perſon, of a ſmooth behaviour, and a great Courtier; agreeable to which temper of mind, ſo ſoon as he attained this promotion, he ſent an obliging and courteous Meſſage to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the deceaſed Vizier, condoling with them the death of their Maſter, promiſing to take them and their Concernments into his Care and Protection; according whereunto he advanced <hi>Solyman</hi> Kahya (who was the late Vizier's Subſtitute,) and for ſome years had managed all Affairs to the Office of Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore, which is chief Maſter of the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors horſe, and is a place not only of honour, but of great ſecurity. He that was his own Kahya he made a Vizier of the Bench, and Chimacam in the ſame manner as he was to <hi>Achmet</hi> Vizier; by which point of policy he ſeemed to have ſtrengthened himſelf againſt all Enemies, for having two Creatures of his own ſo well diſpoſed; one near the Perſon of his Prince, who would be able to do him all good Offices; and the other (whenſoever the Wars or other occaſions ſhould cauſe him to be abſent from the Royal Preſence) might ſupply his place without attempting to ſupplant him. The Kapiſler-Kahyaſee, or Maſter of the Ceremonies to the late Vizier, he made his own Kahya, and all the other Agas which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on that Court, he received into his own ſervice; ſo that in effect there ſeemed, by this great chance of Mortality, to be little other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the Court, than of the ſingle perſon of the deceaſed Vizier; of whoſe Memory, that the Grand Signior might evidence the love and eſteem that he retained, he did not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle or appropriate unto himſelf any part of his Eſtate, or diſanulled his Teſtament; but reſigned all into the hands of his Relations, challenging no ſhare or proportion thereof: And whereas the Vizier leſt no Children, the Eſtate fell to his Brother and Siſters, who to evidence their Devotion to Religion, and good will to the Publick, and to pleaſe the eyes of the envious World, conferred on <hi>Mecha</hi> the Rent of the new Cuſtom houſe, the Beſaſteen, and new Chan built at <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and finiſhed in the year 1677.</p>
                     <p>At this firſt change there were rumors that the new Vizier had begun his Government in blood, having cut off ſeveral heads lately in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but all was falſe, and only grounded on a diſpleaſure which he was known to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived againſt certain perſons. Only one act he performed rather of juſtice than ſeverity, having cut off one of the Pay-maſters of the Exchequer for falſe Money. The occaſion was this: Certain Muletiers having received mony from the Exchequer in Venetian Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins, and finding ſeveral of them falſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them again, but could not previal to have them changed; whereupon having made their Memorial thereof, they carried them to the Vizier, and upon examination, the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter declared, That he received them from the Great <hi>Ibrahim</hi> Han-ogli, who being for that Cauſe ſent for and accuſed, was put into a fear, which proved as dangerous to him as a Diſeaſe, the apprehenſions of Death being worſe than the reality; but the Great Tefterdar ſoon cleared him of this Accuſation, having atteſted, That to his knowledge the mony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him was good, and diſpoſed on other occaſions; ſo that the whole blame ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now on the Pay-maſter, and upon farther ſearch more of the ſame ſtamp being found in his hands, he deſervedly ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Death, the which had likewiſe been inflicted on another Officer of the ſame rank, but not being found ſo culpable as the other, he was permitted to redeem his life with forty Purſes of Mony, or twenty thouſand Dollars.</p>
                     <p>Thus far we have ſeen the gentle and ſmooth behaviour of the preſent Vizier towards the Friends, Relations, and Servants of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed,<note place="margin">Aherati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens with the new Vizier.</note> and with what Acts of Juſtice he began his Government. But, behold, on a ſudden the face of the whole Court was changed, every Officer thereof putting on a Countenance of fierceneſs, pride, and arrogance, beyond the manner and cuſtom lately practiſed. For the Great Viſier took on himſelf the State and Grandeur of the Sultan, (the acceſs being as difficult to him as to his Maſter) his Kahya that of the Viſier, and ſo every inferior Officer advanced himſelf into a fancy of poſſeſſing the next and immediate Degree above him. This haughty behaviour had a more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the Miniſters and Repreſentatives of Foreign Princes, whoſe Interpreters were not admitted, as formerly, to private Audiences or Conferences about their Affairs, but only at the Publick Divan, where their Arzes or Memorials were to be preferred in the ſame manner as was practiſed by the Subjects of the Country, and thoſe of conquered Nations, who petition for Juſtice. The which abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not only caſt on the Interpreters, but on the Perſons of the Repreſentatives them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: an example of which we have in the French Ambaſſador; who coming at the time appointed to receive his Audience of the Viſier, was forced to expect a long time before he could have admittance, and then entering into the Chamber of Audience, was rudely crouded, and ruſhed upon by a Crew of unmannerly Chaouſes, who no otherwiſe regarded the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Ambaſſador, than if he had been one of the Grooms or Lacquies. Being come to the Seat of Audience, the Ambaſlador ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That the Stool for the Great Viſier was ſet upon the Soffrá, and that for Him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or at the foot of it; the which being an unuſual and unpractiſed diminution of the ancient honour given formerly to Ambaſſadors, he ordered one of his Servants, To ſet it again on the Soffrá equal with that of the Viſier's; the which being done, was again brought down by one of the Viſiers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and placed as before; whereupon, the Ambaſſador ſeizing the Stool with his own hand, carried it on the Sofftá, and ſate upon it; which being reported to the Viſier, then in his retiring Chamber, he ſent twice to him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, letting him know, That unleſs the Stool were returned into the Place appointed by him,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:39539:134"/>he would not appear in the Chamber of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Whereunto his Excellency returned this prudent Anſwer, That the Viſier might diſpoſe of his Chair as he pleaſed, but not of his Perſon. In which Interim the Chaouſ-Baſhee came in, roaring out, <hi>Calder, Calder,</hi> which is, Take it away, Take it away, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stool) at which noiſe the Ambaſſador ariſing to ſee what the matter was, had the Stool taken from under him; whereat being greatly enraged, he threw out of the Room in a high paſſion, and cauſing the Preſents which he brought to be again returned with him, he mounted his Horſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
                     <p>Afterwards it was intimated unto the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ambaſſador, That he might, if he pleaſed, receive Audience of the Great Vifier; But his Excellency, uuderſtanding in what manner the French Ambaſſador had been treated, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed his going, on pretence of an Indiſpoſition of health. Howſoever, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Bailo, and the Reſidents of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be admitted unto Audience on thoſe terms which the Viſier was pleaſed to allow. And though during the time that he was Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macam, and bore other inferior Offices, and Charges of Truſt, his behaviour was gentle, affable, and civil; yet I fear, that now having changed his Office, he will have altered his humour, and that his Greatneſs will have en-creaſed his Pride, Avarice, and Fierceneſs: thus, no man knows what another will be, when he ſhall enter into power.</p>
                     <q>Dic mihi ſi fueris tu Leo, qualis eris.</q>
                     <p>And as <hi>Magiſtratus indicat Virum,</hi> ſo in the actions of his management the temper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this great Perſon will be diſcovered. And thus having given a ſhort Account and Character of this preſent Viſier, his future Acts and Monuments muſt be the Subject of other Pens.</p>

                  <p>THE Hiſtory of the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, having been transferr'd to us by Mr. <hi>Knolles</hi> very methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and well, and continued by the deferving Pen of Sir <hi>Paul Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caut,</hi> to the Year 1676, being the Twenty eighth of <hi>Sultan Mahomet</hi> the Fourth, now reigning: We have, as well by inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to ſatisfie the deſires of ſome Friends, thought fit to proſecute ſo laudable a Deſign, by extending the Hiſtory of that great Monarchy to our preſent Times. And though we may be defective in skill for ſo Eminent an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, we ſhall notwithſtanding add Induſtry to our Endeavours, and compenſate our Failings by the candour and ingenuity of our Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Achmet,</hi> the great <hi>Viſier,</hi> being dead in his way to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Kara Muſtapha,</hi> his Brother-in-Law, aged about fifty, and who had exerciſed the office of <hi>Caimacan</hi> for many years. The Grand Seignior, to indear him the more to him, married him to one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though very young, not exceeding five years of age, according to the cuſtom practiſed by the <hi>Sultans,</hi> to be rid of their Daughters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which are always numerous, by reaſon of the multiplicity of their Concubines, and by this means to eaſe themſelves of the Expence which they are obliged to be at in maintaining them according to their Quality.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Month of <hi>January,</hi> the ſtrong Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Caniſia,</hi> having drawn out a Party to attack the Iſle of <hi>Sexin,</hi> allarmed all <hi>Croatia,</hi> by their Military Executions exacting Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pillaging and burning ſuch places as did not ſubmit to their tyranny. The Turks of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> did alſo ravage the Countrey on their ſide as far as <hi>Fryſtat.</hi> But before we enter upon their ſtage of War, it may be requiſite to ſay ſomewhat of the Troubles of <hi>Hungary</hi> which preceded, and their cauſes, and how the Infidels came to be Principals in a War of Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Hungary,</hi> being ſubdivided into Counties, as in <hi>England,</hi> or Communities, have right to ſend their Deputies to the Dyets or Conventions of the Eſtates, which ought to be ſummoned every three years, according to the Laws of the Kingdom. This Aſſembly is compoſed of the Clergy, the principal Lords, the Gentry, and the ſaid Deputies of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It hath the right of chooſing a Palatine, who ought to be an <hi>Hungarian</hi> according to the priviledges of the Nation, and to have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire direction of War and Juſtice. The great Lords have ſo great Authority over their Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, that they are look'd upon as ſo many leſſer Sovereigns in their ſeveral Territories. They have alſo great Revenues, which inables them upon occaſion to raiſe conſiderable Bodies of Men, the People in general being ſtrong, active, and valiant, but covetous, vindicative, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant.</p>
                  <p>The great Employments of the Kingdom were alſo inveſted in the Natives, and no Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were to be impoſed upon them, or Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers enquartered amongſt them; all which the Emperour, upon his Election to the Crown, was obliged to obſerve by the ſolemnity of an Oath. But on the other ſide, there being very many <hi>Arrians, Calviniſts,</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> in the Countrey, they added to the averſion the Natives have to the <hi>Germans,</hi> having been, as they thought, too ſeverely uſed by them; complaining, that they were hindred in the free Exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, their Churches violently taken away from them, and their Miniſters forced from their Duty. It was farther complained, that the Grandees of the Kingdom were not permitted to injoy their Priviledges, of which one was, <hi>That none of them ſhould for any Crime whatſoever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened before any Judges but thoſe of their own Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, as the Emperour had ſworn to maintain their Priviledges, he had likewiſe promiſed to derend their Country, which could not be done againſt the Inſults of ſo powerful an Enemy as the Turk, without an Army; and thoſe ſtrangers living ill with the Inhabitants, and they again ſhutting their Towns againſt them, occaſioned infinite Violences and Diſorders on both ſides, which Repugnancy was the ſource of all the Troubles in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour, beginning to ſuſpect the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> by reaſon of the obſtinacy wherewith they refuſed to lodge his Troops, began ſeriouſly to think of ſecuring the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to himſelf, which being perceived, he aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:39539:136"/>by that Precaution the hatred which the Nation had conceived againſt him; which was re-doubled by the refuſal of his Generals to withdraw their Troops out of their Fortreſſes. Theſe Grievances did ſo far agitate theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, already jealous and diffident, that they at length reſolved to ſhake off a Yoke that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo inſupportable. Many great Lords by their particular Intereſt were glad to entertain this averſion, which might ſerve for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deſigns they had already formed. And thus the Spirit of revolting did inſenſibly diffuſe it ſelf through the whole Kingdom, and the general averſion grew to that height, that they of the Religion ſaid openly, that they would rather live under the Domination of the <hi>Turks</hi> than the Tyranny of the <hi>Germans,</hi> whilſt one of their Preachers did dare maliciouſly to inſinuate, <hi>That theſe Infidels would at leaſt grant them the liberty of their Religion; whilſt the</hi> Dutch <hi>would rack their Conſciences, under pretence of reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour being informed of theſe mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, thought it expedient to ſecure the <hi>Lower Hungary,</hi> and ſo ſtrangle the Rebellion in its birth. Their reiterated preſſing to have the German Troops removed out of the Kingdom, gave him juſt cauſe of jealouſie: and beſides, he would not loſe the expence of all his toyls, and thoſe vaſt charges he had been at in forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Frontier places, and entertaining Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies capable to oppoſe the Invaſions of the Turks. Finally, he judged it abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to reduce a Nation to their duty, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their diſobedience to his Orders: being a King is no farther a Sovereign, than whilſt he obliges his Subjects to pay obedience to the Laws, and his Commands.</p>
                  <p>And thus in ſhort we have ſhewed the cauſe of this Revolt (which yet laſt) on both ſides, and though perhaps this digreſſion may ſeem foreign to ſome, yet, being the Turks have been ſo mainly concerned as to become Parties in it, we thought it reaſonable to ſubjoyn it to their Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>And now to come nearer to the matter in hand, we will ſay ſomewhat of the Maxims of theſe Infidels, which will give us ſome light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Policies; And firſt, it is a fundamental one to keep their Men perpetually imployed; for Idleneſs ingenders indigeſted Humours in the Politick, as well as the Natural Body, which renders it infirm. Another Maxim is, that they do never imploy their Forces more than in one War at one time, unleſs againſt weak Princes; Nor do they deſire to continue long in Arms againſt the ſame Enemy, unleſs conſtrained by their conſtancy, to the end they may not grow too warlike and expert; but leaving them by Treaties and Pacifications to their eaſe, keep themſelves ſtill employed, and conſequently diſciplined, and their Sables from ruſting, by continual managing of them. They moreover never break out into a diſtant War, before they have compos'd Affairs with their Neighbours. Thus when they tranſport their Armies toward the Frontiers of <hi>Perſia,</hi> they make Peace with the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and ſo on the contrary. But the unhappy <hi>Europeans,</hi> giving them more opportunities by their diffention to inlarge their Empire than any other, they, as well out of Ambition, as an irreconcileable Enmity to the Name of Chriſt, purſue the ſame with equal violence and hate. Hence it was, that though they had a Peace with the Emperour, they did not ceaſe to countenance and aſſiſt his Rebels in <hi>Hungary</hi> underhand with their Forces and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections, receiving them, when cloſely purſu'd, into their own Quarters, where, being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Imperial Troops, ſeveral Hoſtilities were committed by them, which produced in ſome time an open rupture between the two Nations. The Emperour, to hinder this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce betwixt them, diſpatch'd <hi>Meninsky,</hi> his Interpreter for the Oriental Languages, to the <hi>Port;</hi> with inſtructions to diſcover whether the Hoſtilities which were committed upon his Subjects, were done by command of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at that Court? But he could effect nothing. He had indeed had Audience of the Viſier at <hi>Adrianople,</hi> who only told him, That the Grand Seignior would ſend a Chiaux of his own to his Imperial Majeſty, who ſhould inform him of his Intentions.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour hereupon diſpatched an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to Count <hi>Schaffgots,</hi> his Envoy in <hi>Poland,</hi> with orders to endeavour to break the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of Peace betwixt that Crown and the Sultan, though this Precaution proved of no effect, the Treaty betwixt thoſe Potentates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigned preſently after, and very ſeaſonably on the <hi>Poles</hi> ſide, who, having an Army ſcarce of 15000 Men, were ſurrounded near <hi>Zorawno,</hi> by well night 200000 Turks, who yet gave them Peace when they leaſt expected it, tho' upon Conditions then not ungrateful, tho' af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards quarrell'd at. The <hi>Tranſilvanians</hi> did alſo joyn with the Malecontents, for Prince <hi>Abaffi,</hi> having diſcovered a Conſpiracy againſt his Life, in <hi>April,</hi> and ſuſpecting the <hi>Germans</hi> to have deſigned it, it contributed much to engage him againſt them. About the end of this Month the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> was ſtrangled by order of the Grand Seignior, perhaps by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his immenſe Riches; for they found two Millions of Money, which was brought into the Sultan's Treaſury.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there happened an Encounter betwixt the <hi>Malecontents</hi> and the <hi>Croats,</hi> where the firſt were worſted; but the Turks at the ſame time pillaged a Town near <hi>Raab,</hi> putting all the Inhabitants to the Sword; and 4000 of theſe Infidels, having gained the Paſſage of the River <hi>Hydrousk,</hi> upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Croatia</hi> and <hi>Styria,</hi> ravaged the Country even to the Gates of <hi>Papa,</hi> of <hi>Veſprin</hi> and of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grat,</hi> driving away a great number of Cattel, and burning a great many Houſes.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Abaffi,</hi> finding that the Grand Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or did approve of the aſſiſtance he gave the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> ſent them freſh Troops, with twenty pieces of Cannon. Their Army being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Count <hi>Weſſelini,</hi> their Palatine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 16000 Men, deſigned to beſiege <hi>Zatmar</hi> and <hi>Kalo,</hi> which Major General <hi>Smith,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Germans,</hi> perceiving, he ſent a Convoy with Artillery and Ammunition to the firſt of theſe places, which was defeated and taken by the <hi>Malecontents.</hi> But my deſign not being to deſcribe this War, I ſhall only men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it, as far forth as I find the Turks, whoſe Hiſtory we write, concerned in it. Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Peace in <hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>Hungarians</hi> had ſent thither to engage part of the Troops which that King had disbanded, to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and obtained 6000 of them, commanded by the Count of <hi>Boham,</hi> who joyning with the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Horſe, defeated <hi>Smith,</hi> with part of the Imperial Army, who deſigned to obſtruct their Conjunction with <hi>Weſſelini;</hi> which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever being effected, they could ſcarce ſuffice to withſtand General <hi>Kops,</hi> in ſo much that being aſſured that the Peace was not only concluded betwixt the <hi>Poles</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> but that the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:39539:136"/>
                     <hi>Palatine of Culm</hi> was ſent to <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> to ſee it ratified, they alſo deputed one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Officers to endeavour to oblige the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to turn his Arms againſt the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi> But being the Turks were in actual War with the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> they would not (being already engaged againſt ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Enemy) intangle themſelves in a new War: And yet this <hi>Envoy</hi> obtained ſo much, that Orders were ſent to the Baſſaes of <hi>Buda,</hi> of <hi>Belgrade, Waradin,</hi> and other Places in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> to aſſiſt them with all their Power. And they were aſſiſted by them, for theſe Infidels, not content to ſend Troops to joyn with them, they themſelves made ſeveral Incurſions in their favour. Four hundred Men of the Garriſon of <hi>Nieuhauſel</hi> took ſeveral Priſoners by <hi>Neutra,</hi> and beat the <hi>Huſſars</hi> of <hi>Comorra</hi> who would have oppoſed them; two thouſand Turks entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Croatia,</hi> and having ſpoiled the Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Zaklholm,</hi> they defeated a party of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts near <hi>Carlſtat.</hi> And thus theſe Infidels made War without declaring it, pretending they did not violate the Peace by theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Encounters. But the Emperour being of another opinion, diſpatch'd <hi>Hoffman,</hi> his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State and War, to complain to the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> how his Baſſaes did daily aſſiſt his Rebels, againſt the purport of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Empires. Being admitted to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the Grand Viſier, that Miniſter made him ſome propoſitions for the renewing of the Peace, but ſo diſadvantageous to his Maſter, that it ſeemed apparent, that the Turks ſought for nothing more than a pretence to break. And yet the Secretary effected ſo much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin</hi> was arreſted, and afterwards ſtrangled by order of the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> who yet would give that ſatisfaction to the Emperour upon the preſſing Inſtances of his Secretary, who alſo had made rich Preſents to all the Miniſters of the Port.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Hoffman</hi> negotiated with ſo little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the States of <hi>Hungary</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Altemburg,</hi> where it was reſolved, that the Churches which had been taken from the Proteſtants, ſhould be reſtored to them, and many other points remitted in their Favour, in hopes theſe conceſſions might oblige them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their Duty, and break thoſe Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had entred into with the Infidels. But this paſſed no farther, for the Miniſters endeavoured to elude the ſaid Article, though the moſt important of all, and therefore the more inſiſted upon by the <hi>Malecontents.</hi> This gave the Deputies of the Diet ſubject to believe that though the Miniſters of the Emperour ſeemed to deſire an Accommodation, yet they did not ſearch the means to affect it. And now the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> inſtead of conforming to the Emperour's Intentions, reſolved to elect another King, and ſome of them propoſed one of the Houſe of <hi>Frangipani;</hi> though it did not take, being they could not agree upon the choice of their Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, the Palatines and great Men of the Kingdom, being weary to ſee the Crown as it were Hereditary in the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> made uſe of the pretence of Religion to ſtir up the People, and oblige them to take Arms for defence of their Liberty, both Spiritual and Civil. And this averſion was the true Cauſe of the War.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour was no leſs diſſatisfied with the Turks; for General <hi>Kops,</hi> having ſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin,</hi> for that he had given Quarters to the <hi>Hungarians</hi> in Places which depended on his government; the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa told him, That he look'd upon them as Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, who paid for what they took for their ſubſiſtance, and that conſequently he could not look upon their Reception into his Territories as any violation of the Peace.</p>
                  <p>The Hoſtilities betwixt the Imperialiſts and the Turks did ſtill continue notwithſtanding their Negotiations. Five hundred Chriſtian Horſe, commanded by <hi>Azos Benas,</hi> advancing towards <hi>Erlaw,</hi> were cut in pieces by the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Another Party, commanded by Collonel <hi>Wolping,</hi> was likewiſe defeated by a Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Garriſon of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> with the loſs of above 200, the Commander being alſo much hurt. A few days after this Encounter the Baſſa of that City dyed, which occaſioned an Accident which did well-nigh make a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betwixt the Emperour and the Port. The Imperialiſts had unadviſedly attack'd the new Baſſa which the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> did ſend to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſel,</hi> and defeated his Convoy conſiſting of 200 Horſe, by way of Repriſal, as they gave out, for the Damages which had been done them by the Garriſon of the Place, without conſidering that this new Governour had had no ſhare in theſe Violences. The Baſſa of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> ſent his complaints of this Affront to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial General, with threats that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his Maſter with it, and exact ſatisfaction by all the ways imaginable. And they did ſo, for, drawing out ſtrong Parties from the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Erlam</hi> and <hi>Waradin,</hi> they reſolved to revenge the Inſult done to the Baſſa of <hi>Newhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> and marching towards <hi>Sando</hi> near <hi>Butrac,</hi> which they pillaged, they returned with above 200 Priſoners. Count <hi>Wourmb,</hi> the Emperour's General, demanded Juſtice for this Violence from the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> but received no other anſwer, but that what was done was by way of Repriſal.</p>
                  <p>During theſe Traverſes Count <hi>Paul Weſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi> dyed, who had Commanded the Army of the <hi>Malecontents</hi> with great ſucceſs, but is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by Count <hi>Tekeley,</hi> young, yet wary and brave; who, to this day heads the however broken diſcontented Party. The Emperour, who knew that the greateſt force of <hi>Tekeley</hi>'s Army came from <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> would divert <hi>Abaffi</hi> by re-eſtabliſhing the Party of <hi>Pedipold,</hi> who had formerly conteſted for the Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that Principality. To this end he obliged that Prince to ſend four Deputies to <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> to implore the protection of the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, but the Viſier cauſed them to be put into the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers, which extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed the Emperour's Reſident, who had orders to Negotiate that Affair joyntly with them. The Emperour being informed hereof, ſent <hi>Monſieur Jullies</hi> with ſecret Inſtructions to the Port, but he dyed by the way, which did not a little trouble his Imperial Majeſty, being all this Envoy's Papers fell into Count <hi>Teke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Hands, who drew no ſmall advantage from the lights he received by them. <hi>Hoffman,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary of State, returning from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was ſtopped at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> being the Baſſa of that Place refuſed to furniſh him with neceſſaries for the continuation of his Journey. But the Emperour, having diſpatch'd an Expreſs to the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> to complain of this incivility, he obtained what he deſired. Being upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Belgrade,</hi> he was informed that the Great Viſier was arrived upon the Banks of the <hi>Danube</hi> with a great Army, and deſign to enter into the Province of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kraine</hi> to fight the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> he ſent to demand Audience of him, but this Miniſter returned him for anſwer, That
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:39539:137"/>he ſhould have it at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when the Campaign was ended. Many and great were the Encounters betwixt the Imperialiſts and Malecontents, the latter being for the moſt part ſucceſsful, who alſo ravaged <hi>Moravia,</hi> being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by 2000 <hi>Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Auſtria</hi> it ſelf, under the Command of Collonel <hi>Joſua,</hi> ſometimes a Prieſt, known by the Name of Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who turning Proteſtant, raiſed 6000 Men at his own Charges, and joyning with the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, grew formidable even to the Gates of <hi>Vienna.</hi> But the Imperialiſts had alſo their turn, and Count <hi>Eſterhaſi,</hi> Governour of <hi>Papa,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked 2000 Janizaries and 500 Spahies, near <hi>Veſpren:</hi> He took ſeveral Priſoners, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſome Agas. As this Action might cauſe a Rupture, if miſ-repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Empires; his Imperial Majeſty diſpatch'd a Courier to the Port, to inform the Grand Seignior with the particulars of this Combat.</p>
                  <p>The conſtancy of the Malecontents, and their Intelligence with the Turks did not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet the Emperour, but he was more troubled when he heard that theſe Infidels were upon the point of agreeing with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which would put them into a Condition to turn all their power againſt him. He thought he could not do better than to divert them by obliging the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to break with them, and therefore ſent the Baron of <hi>Meierburg</hi> to <hi>Hiſpahan</hi> to negotiate that Affair.</p>
                  <p>The Diet of <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> being held at <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenburg,</hi> the Grand Seignior, as well to ſecure his own Intereſt, as being diſſatisfied with Prince <hi>Abaffi</hi>'s Conduct, ſent the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin</hi> with a ſtrong Army to preſide at that Aſſembly. But things being accommodated betwixt them, to the ſatisfaction of the ſtrongeſt; the <hi>Tranſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanian</hi> and the Baſſa's bordering upon his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, who had been at the Diet, had no other thoughts but of deliberating with the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> of the means how to aſſiſt them. The Emperour being advertiſed hereof, ſent Doctor <hi>Ferling</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to endeavour to penetrate into the Intentions of that Monarch, and hinder that the Baſſaes ſhould not ſuccour the Rebels. There was alſo ſome under-hand dealing with the great ones or the Party, to make their particular Peace with the Court. Amongſt others, the Propoſition being made to <hi>Palaffi Imbre,</hi> he found ſo little ſecurity in it, that to ſhew his Companions he would never accommode himſelf with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, he treated with the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> to deliver all the Places that were in his power, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand and poſſeſſion, the which alſo he put in Execution, tho' his Caſtle of <hi>Devin</hi> was in the mean time inveſted by Count <hi>Straſoldo,</hi> before the Turks could enter it, and together with the City forced by him, 500 of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon being made Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Seignior, to ſhew the eſteem and ſatisfaction he had of the Perſon of <hi>Abaffi,</hi> ſent him a Sable as a token of his Favour; and gave Orders at the ſame time to all the Baſſaes of <hi>Hungary,</hi> to ſend Troops and Forces as oft as he ſhould require them, being abſolutely reſolved to aſſiſt the Malecontents, which he alſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively did.</p>
                  <p>There had happened a great Battel between the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Muſcovites</hi> near <hi>Czecherin,</hi> which the firſt had beſieged. The Turks had been worſted at firſt, but rallying their Forces, they came before <hi>Czecherin</hi> again, where, after play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight or nine Mines, they ſo furiouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted the Place, that they carried it, with the ſlaughter of the Garriſon, which was great; for all that, after many Skirmiſhes, they were forced to retire for want of Proviſions. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Great Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> knowing that the Emperour, not without reaſon, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Turks would declare War againſt him, ſent him a ſolemn Embaſſie, with offer of making a League Offenſive and Defenſive with him againſt the Infidels; but the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, contrary to the advice of <hi>Montecuculi,</hi> who offered to Command the Army in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, tho' his great Age might juſtly diſpence with the Fatigues of War; did not think it adviſable to break with the Port. The Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> being informed of the arrival of the Ambaſſadour, ſent a Chaoux to <hi>Vienna,</hi> under colour of complaining of ſome Inroads which the Imperialiſts had made into the Grand Seignior's Territories, but indeed to obſerve the motions of the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Nor were they the onely motives that exhorted the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to Arm againſt the Turks. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent Prince <hi>Radzivil</hi> to aſſure his Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty, that he would willingly enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a League againſt the Infidels, if he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to declare War againſt them: And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, two Nuntios of the Pope's, who were then at Court, did preſs this Prince to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine to prevent the Enemy, who would not fail to attack him, when a favourable Occaſion preſented it ſelf; they could not perſwade him to embrace a Propoſition ſo favourable for the repoſe of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Emperour, not finding himſelf in a Condition to reduce the Malecontents by force, reſolved to grant what they demanded, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they would permit him to levy in <hi>Hungary</hi> the ſame Contributions and Taxes which were exacted in the Hereditary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Count <hi>Leſley</hi> had ſeveral Conterences with Collonel <hi>Joſua</hi> thereupon; and having diſcuſſed this Affair, the principal points were agreed upon, which being communicated to <hi>Keski</hi> and <hi>Tekeley,</hi> they promiſed to procure the conſents of the other Chiefs to agree to them. Upon this favourable diſpoſition, <hi>Leſley</hi> had orders to ſend his Troops into Winter Quarters; but the precipitate departure of the Emperour to <hi>Mazianzel,</hi> and thence to <hi>Prague,</hi> by reaſon of the Plague at <hi>Vienna,</hi> this Affair was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the meaſures taken in it changed.</p>
                  <p>The Plague ſpread alſo into the Turkiſh Countries, and conſtrained 500 Families to quit <hi>Newhauſel.</hi> Theſe were ſcarce got a League from the Town, but they were ſurpriſed by five hundred <hi>Huſars</hi> or <hi>Haiducs,</hi> who took from them all they had, of which the Turks made great complaints, which ſeemed the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, being they were ſo civil to Count <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Troops; for he being obliged by the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to change Quarters, encamped betwixt <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitz</hi> and <hi>Strigonium,</hi> for the better ſubſiſtance of his Army. The Baſſa of this laſt place, to ſhew the Count that the Grand Seignior did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of his Subjects joyning with the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; permitted him to buy ſuch Proviſions as he wanted in the Territories of his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and alſo preſented him with ſeveral refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> preſſed the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to conclude a League Offenſive and Defenſive with them againſt the Grand Seignior; this Prince being not averſe to the propoſition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Reſident to repreſent to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that being he would not engage in this Union, he ought at leaſt to keep a ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in <hi>Hungary</hi> of 30000 Men, to oppoſe the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:39539:137"/>Malecontents, and keep the Turks in ſuſpence on that ſide, and his Majeſty promiſed to do it; but the want of Monies hindered him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Deſign ſo honourable for himſelf, and ſo adventageous for Chriſtendom.</p>
                  <p>However, he endeavoured by the Baron of <hi>Kaunitz,</hi> his Reſident at the Port, to negotiate a Continuation of the <hi>Trevis;</hi> but the Grand Seignior would not conſent to it but upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould be at liberty to aſſiſt the Malecontents at pleaſure; which indeed had been to augment the Evil, not heal it. This Prince was at the ſame time advertiſed, that the Port had concluded a Peace with the <hi>Poles</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> which gave him occaſion to judge that he had a Deſign to turn his Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
                  <p>Many were the Treaties betwixt he Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and the Malecontents, and his Majeſty's conceſſions ſuch, that the Grand Seignior began to apprehend, that <hi>Tekeley</hi> had ſome inclinations to return to his Obedience to his Sovereign; to prevent which, he ſent a Baſſa to divert him, by offering him the Principality of <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> after the deceaſe of <hi>Abaffi.</hi> This Baſſa had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conferences with him and with the other Chiefs of the Faction, and did ſo well manage them, with the pretended advantages that they would find by putting themſelves under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Port, that eighty of them did promiſe, in the name of all the Kingdom, to pay to his <hi>Ottoman</hi> Highneſs a Tribute of eighty thouſand Crowns, provided he would power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſiſt them. This Intrigue being made known to the Emperour, he received it with much Indignation, commanding, that none of the contrivers of it ſhould appear at the Diet. In the mean time he ordered the Marqueſs of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Staremburg,</hi> to cauſe <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Vienna,</hi> whereof they were Governours, to be fortified, to prevent any Deſigns of the Turks upon thoſe Places. And now his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did no more queſtion but that the Infidels would tranſport the War into <hi>Hungary,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, being informed by his Reſident <hi>Kaunitz</hi> at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> that the Port, after many and long Diſputes, had at length concluded a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> for twenty years, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition, that beſides <hi>Kiovia,</hi> they ſhould enjoy <hi>Tripol, Staiki</hi> and <hi>Vaſikow,</hi> which had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been dependants upon <hi>Kiovia.</hi> The Grand Viſier received theſe Propoſitions with joy, and writ to the <hi>Czar</hi> thereupon, with very extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Praiſes and Titles, aſſuring him in the name of the Grand Seignior, that he would ratifie the Conditions agreed upon, and that he might ſend his Ambaſſadour to finiſh the Treaty. In the mean time, the Viſier, to prevent the <hi>Czar</hi>'s refuſal of ſending another Miniſter before his, which reſided at the Port, (who had been kept under reſtraint for ſome time) was returned into <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> he forthwith diſmiſſed him, with magnificent Preſents for his Maſter. The Grand Seignior, who ſeemed reſolved to invade <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> ſtaying his removal to <hi>Adrianople</hi> but till the return of this Ambaſſadour, did emit a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt or Mandate directed to Prince <hi>Abaffi,</hi> in theſe following terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Foraſmuch as thoſe of</hi> Hungary, <hi>who have received the Emperour of the</hi> Nazarien <hi>Nation to be their Lord, have been ſpoiled of their Country and Caſtles by the</hi> Germans, <hi>and have therefore had recourſe to our Clemency for Protection; it is Our pleaſure, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their long and piteous miſeries, and being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto moved by their reiterated Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, graciouſly to affranchiſe them from the Yoke of that Nation. 'Tis therefore that We communicate this Deſign to you, as Our faithful Miniſter, by the Baſſa</hi> Caput, <hi>and the Aga</hi> Starra, <hi>with expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that you make your ſelf forthwith ready to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the</hi> Hungarians <hi>from the Oppreſſion of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with all the Forces of</hi> Tranſilvania, <hi>which ſhall be immediately reinforced with thoſe of</hi> Valachia, <hi>and of the Baſſa of</hi> Siliſtria, 13003 <hi>Janizaries, and</hi> 2000 <hi>Horſe; for We have promiſed them Our Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Protection in conſideration of the Fidelity which they have manifeſted to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, which We have ſince had experience of. And therefore We Command you yet again to neglect nothing that may tend to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Our Pleaſure and good Will, to the end, that by the Aſſiſtance of the moſt High and moſt Mighty God, this People, ſo cruelly oppreſſed, may be forthwith delivered from the Bondage of the unmerciful</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. <hi>In the mean time, you ſhall from time to time inform Our great</hi> Ottoman <hi>Mightineſs with what ſhall happen, and what you ſhall have done purſuant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And you are farther enjoyned to take heed that you do nothing that may be diſadvantageous to Our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Greatneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abaffi,</hi> animated with this Mandate, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Orders that were neceſſary, drew his Troops together, and joyned with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keley,</hi> with the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Valachians</hi> and the <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davians,</hi> emitting withal a Declaration, That he did not Arm againſt the Intereſt of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but only to deliver the Proteſtants of <hi>Hungary</hi> from the Oppreſſion they laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by reſtoring them in their Poſſeſſions and their Churches, and re-eſtabliſhing them in their ancient Priviledges. He added, that the Grand Seignior had expreſly commiſſioned him for this Expedition, which he alſo undertook with the conſent of all the States of <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> He had beſieged <hi>Zatmar,</hi> and preſſed the place vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, to ſhew the Defendants that he was in a Condition to force them if they would not voluntarily Surrender. A few days after, he received a recruit of 8000 Men, which the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> ſent him, who had already aſſembled an Army of 40000 Men, which he incamped near the place of his Government.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt <hi>Abaffi</hi> was engaged in the aforeſaid Siege, 3000 Turks made an Inroad into <hi>Styria</hi> near <hi>Gratz,</hi> where they took a 1000 Priſoners, which they made Slaves, and very much Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage. And now the Grand Seignior reſolves not only to aſſiſt the Malecontents, but joyntly with them to force the Places of <hi>Hungary,</hi> until they were in a condition to pay him the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute they were engaged to do. In the mean time, <hi>Abaffi,</hi> having made his Circumvallation about <hi>Zatmar,</hi> divided his Army into four Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: The firſt was compoſed of the <hi>Tranſilvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the ſecond of the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> the third of <hi>Turks,</hi> and the fourth of the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> and he forced the City, but could not take the Citadel, which obliged him to raiſe his Siege. Many were the Diſcourſes of this Action, and ſome gave out, that <hi>Abaffi</hi> had no mind to take the Place, upon a Surmiſe, that the Grand Seignior pretended it ſhould be delivered into his Hands upon Surrender. However it was, it is certain that the Baſſa which commanded the <hi>Ottomans</hi> at this Siege, ſent great Complaints to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> againſt this Prince, which obliged him to return into his own Countrey, leſt his Enemies ſhould take advantage by his abſence. Thus this great Army vaniſhed, as well by the miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the Chiefs, and the rigour of the Seaſon, the Winter approaching; as by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancy of Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> the Imperial General; who, tho' he was not able to fight the Enemy,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:39539:138"/>did notwithſtanding perpetually incommode them with Parties and Detachments. <hi>Tekely</hi> hereupon having pillaged and burnt <hi>Kalo,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Citadel, which he garriſoned, put his Troops into their Winter quarters. But the Turks, to finiſh their Campania would ſurpriſe the Caſtle of <hi>Pettinia,</hi> upon the Borders of <hi>Croa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> but their deſign being diſcovered, the <hi>Militia</hi> of the Country drawing into a body, forced them to retire.</p>
                  <p>On the ſide of the Chriſtians, the Winter was ſpent in fruitleſs Treaties and Conteſtations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Eccleſiaſticks and Seculars; ſave that the Empreſs was crowned Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which was effected with great Magnificence and Pomp. On the other ſide, the Turks having agreed with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> the Grand Seignior reſolved by the Council of his great Viſier, to carry his Arms into <hi>Hungary;</hi> in order to which, vaſt Magazins were made at <hi>Belgrade</hi> and other places of his Obedience. He ſent ſuch Bodies of Men thither, that the Souldiers were forced to lye in Tents and Baracks. <hi>Hali Baſſa,</hi> being ſent thither in the Spring with Monies to pay theſe Forces, behaved himſelf with ſo little Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he had well nigh occaſioned a great Mutiny amongſt them. In his review of them he cauſed the <hi>Spahies</hi> to paſs before the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who being extream jealous of their rank, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinied, and threatned to kill him. To repair this fault, he would reſtore them to their Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but the Spahies took alſo their turn to mutiny; nor did he appeaſe them but by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable gratuity above their pay. Beſides theſe, the preparations for War through all the extent of the <hi>Otthoman</hi> Empire wer ſo vaſt, that they did not ſuffice only to protect the <hi>Malecontents,</hi> but to attack that of <hi>Germany,</hi> and now they lay a Bridge over the <hi>Danube,</hi> and another at <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock,</hi> over the <hi>Teys</hi> or <hi>Tibiſcus,</hi> capable of bearing their great Cannon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekely,</hi> however well informed of the Deſigns of the Port, did notwithſtanding agree to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of the <hi>Trevis</hi> with Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> which was ended the laſt of <hi>March,</hi> to the firſt of <hi>July;</hi> but the <hi>Malecontents</hi> ſlighting the Treaty, did in the beginning of <hi>May</hi> ſeize upon all the Corn which the Emperour had bought upon the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Poland</hi> to furniſh his <hi>Magazins</hi> withal. The Turks alſo attacked and forced a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary who conducted many Wagons loaden with Cloths for the Imperial Army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekely,</hi> being to act as ſoon as the Treaty was ended joyntly with the Turks, judged it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for him to take his meaſures from the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> in order to which he went to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with a Convoy of 3000 Horſe; the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa being advertiſed of his arrival, gave his Son orders to go and receive him at the Gate of the City, at the Head of the <hi>Spahies,</hi> or Horſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement him in his Name, and to regale him with refreſhments according to the Cuſtom of that Nation. Being enter'd the City, he was received by the Baſſa at the head of all his Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries, and after reciprocal Civilities, he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him of the Protection of the Grand Seignior when ever he had need of it. His Troops in the mean time were lodged near <hi>Peſth</hi> along the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſide in Tents. The Baſſa, cauſing <hi>Tekely</hi>'s Bonnet to be taken off, put another after the Turkiſh faſhion upon his Head, enrich'd 'with pretious Stones and a Heron's Feather. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made him a Preſent from his <hi>Otthoman</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of a Sable, a Pole-ax, and a Colours. He gave him alſo upon his own account, ſome Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes richly harneſſed; ſome affirmed that his Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities paſſed further, and that <hi>Tekely</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared King of <hi>Hungary</hi> by the Baſſa, who put the Crown upon his Head, and cloathed him in Royal Habiliments, in preſence of all the Officers of the Garriſon, and ſeveral Baſſaes, who had been expreſly commanded thither to aſſiſt at the Ceremony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekely</hi> having ſatisfied his Ambition, would now content his Love. He had ſent his Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Vienna</hi> to obtain the Emperours Permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to eſpouſe the Princeſs <hi>Rogotski.</hi> His Imperial Majeſty, thinking he ought to manage this Count in a time wherein he endeavoured to make him break his Engagements with the Port; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceiving that it was but a Civility done him, and that if he did not conſent, they would effect it without him, granted his Envoy what ever his Maſter had deſired. <hi>Tekely</hi> gave imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately advice hereof to the Princeſs, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe would not defer his Happineſs any longer. She, who as ſhe had not deſired to ſee him a King, but to prevent her deſcent into a lower rank then that wherein Prince <hi>Rogotsky</hi> had placed her, ſent him word that he might come to <hi>Montcatz,</hi> where, after his return from <hi>Buda,</hi> their Marriage was celebrated with great Pomp. This Lady was Siſter to Count <hi>Serin,</hi> a Roman Catholick, but in ſome few Weeks after her eſpouſals with Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> ſhe turn'd Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and thereupon diſcharged all her Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Servants. This gave ſo much ſuſpition to the Imperial Court, that no more good was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from that Alliance; nor were they decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, his Attachments to the Port being too ſtrict, and his jealouſie of the <hi>Germans</hi> too great. He for all that treated ſtill with Count <hi>Saponara</hi> the Emperours Envoy, but it was to amuze him, in expectation of the Turks taking the field to ſecond his Deſigns. The Emperour did alſo employ Count <hi>Serin</hi> to his new Brother-in-Law, but he, inſtead of ſerving his Sovereign, enter'd into new Engagements, as ſhall be declared hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> made inrodes as far as <hi>Trinchein,</hi> from whence they brought more than 18000 Slaves, killing all the old men, from whom they could expect no Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Palatine would have raiſed the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia</hi> of the Country to oppoſe them, but the Proteſtants refuſed to obey his Orders, until the Emperour would give them Satisfaction upon all the points that had been propoſed in their Name the laſt Diet. About the end of the ſame Month his Imperial Majeſty received Letters from Count <hi>Albret Caprara,</hi> which ſignified to him that he had received Audience from the Great Viſier, and that he could not obtain a prolongation of the <hi>Trevis,</hi> but upon the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> Hungary <hi>ſhould be put into the ſame ſtate that it was in the year</hi> 1655;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That this Kingdom ſhould pay his</hi> Ottho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Highneſs a Tribute of</hi> 50000 <hi>Florins yearly;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the Fortreſſes of</hi> Leopolſtat <hi>and</hi> Gratz <hi>ſhould be demoliſhed;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That</hi> Neutra, Schults, Eckof, <hi>and the Iſle of</hi> Schults <hi>near</hi> Presburg, <hi>with the Fort of</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, <hi>ſhould by a formal ceſſion be delivered to Count</hi> Tekely;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a general</hi> Amneſty <hi>or Act of Oblivion ſhould be granted to the</hi> Malecontents, <hi>and that they ſhould be re-eſtabliſhed in all their Goods and Priviledges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:39539:138"/>
                  <p>Theſe Conditions ſeemed ſo harſh to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that he rejected them, preferring a War before ſuch a ſordid accommodation.</p>
                  <p>The Ceſſation betwixt <hi>Tekely</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> being ended, he joyned Forces with the Turks near <hi>Peſt,</hi> conſiſting of 40000 Men. He paſſed near <hi>Caſchaw</hi> or <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> and turning ſuddenly, ſurpriſed the Caſtle of <hi>Zatmar,</hi> and in a few days after took the City. <hi>Caſſovia</hi> and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Places ran the ſame fate. And now the Turks act by themſelves, <hi>Tokai</hi> rendring it ſelf to them as ſoon as they appeared before it. The Emperour ſent to complain to the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> of theſe Acts of Hoſtility; but he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he did not pretend to break the Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in attacking theſe little places, which were but receptacles of Robbers, the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of daily pillaging his Highneſſes quarters. Thus the ſtrongeſt ſeldom fail of pretences to oppreſs the weakeſt.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin</hi> having beſieged <hi>Fileck,</hi> preſſed it hard. He had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aſſaulted the place thrice, and though <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoldo, Caprara, Staremberg,</hi> and the <hi>Palatine</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with deſign to relieve it; yet all theſe Generals, however brave, durſt not attempt the Enemies Lines; and it might be ſaid, that they were come ſo far but to be witneſſes of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, by the loſs of the place which ſurrendred it ſelf. The ſixteenth of <hi>September,</hi> the <hi>Hungarians</hi> entred into the Turkiſh Service, but the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and all the Officers were made Priſoners, becauſe they refuſed to ſign the Capitulation, and the Women were made ſlaves, the Turks loſt 2000 Janizaries in this ſiege, which obliged them to treat the Officers with ſo much Rigour, and perhaps the place which they demoliſhed was therefore razed, or rather to prevent the Malecontents (who demanded the poſſeſſion of it) from enjoying it.</p>
                  <p>The ſaid Baſſa, after the forcing of <hi>Filek,</hi> went with 40000 Men and inveſted <hi>Lewentz</hi> and <hi>Neutra,</hi> which ſurrendred to him upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And <hi>Tekeley,</hi> taking advantage of the abſence of <hi>Straſoldo,</hi> rendred himſelf Maſter of the High-land Cities. The Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced alſo towards <hi>Gran,</hi> with deſign to make a Bridge there over the <hi>Danube,</hi> to the end he might open a paſſage into upper <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekeley,</hi> ſeeing himſelf Maſter of the upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> eſpecially of the Cities thereof, which by their Mines of Gold made up a great part of the Revenues of the Crown, and now having refreſhed himſelf in theſe rich Quarters, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Moneys to be coined, repreſenting on one ſide his Effiges with this Inſcription: <hi>Emericus Comes</hi> Tekeley <hi>Princeps</hi> Hongariae; and on the reverſe theſe words: <hi>Pro Deo, pro Patria &amp; pro Libertate.</hi> The Winter being now advanced, he ſent his Secretary to <hi>Vienna</hi> to offer a Ceſſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms. This propoſal was not diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Imperial Court, but they could not reſolve to leave the ſaid upper Cities in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; his Deputies repreſented thereupon, That their Maſter could not part with them without the conſent of the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> but that he would favour the Imperial Work-men, and ſuffer them to labour for his Majeſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, provided he might be allowed a Compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for his Protection, if not, he threatned to deſtroy the ſaid Cities, worth 200000 Crowns yearly to his Imperial Majeſty; after ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation the Ceſſation was again agreed upon, and the Directors of the Mines were obliged to pay <hi>Tekeley</hi> ſix hundred Crowns every Week; this <hi>Trevis</hi> did not hinder ſeveral Encounters betwixt the Chriſtians and Turks. A Party of <hi>Huſſars</hi> in <hi>November</hi> defeated a Detatchment of the Infidels, commanded by an Aga, who was kill'd there. There were found in his Pockets nineteen Letters of the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi>'s, writ to Officers of that Nation, ordering them to cauſe the Grand Seignior's Subjects to pay the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Tribute, which his Highneſs was not accuſtomed to exact, but when he undertook ſome great War. Thus the Emperour was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that the Turks deſign was to draw to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all their Forces to attack him the next Summer. He was confirmed in this Opinion by Letters from his Ambaſſadour at the Port, who writ to him, that the Grand Seignior was gone from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> on the twenty eighth of <hi>October</hi> to <hi>Adrianople;</hi> that the great Viſier fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him the next day; that Count <hi>Tekeley</hi> had complained at the Port of the Baſſa of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> accuſing him for having ſeparated his Troops too far from his, and ſo hindered him from making ſuch conſiderable progreſſes in <hi>Hungary</hi> as he might otherwiſe have done; and finally, that the ſaid Baſſa was ſummoned up by the Grand Seignior to anſwer this Accuſation.</p>
                  <p>The great Viſier, being expected at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> the Emperour ſent <hi>Satonara</hi> to meet him, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain more favourable Conditions than thoſe propoſed to Count <hi>Albret Caprara.</hi> He ſent alſo Count <hi>Martinitz</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to the other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to ſollicite for Succours in this extremity. Count <hi>Kaunitz</hi> was likewiſe ſent to <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and many other principal Men to the other Electors and Princes of the Empire, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite their aſſiſtance in ſo preſſing an Exigence. To theſe Count <hi>Walleſtein,</hi> a Knight of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Golden Fleece, was deputed into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to be preſent at the Diet of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate a League with that Crown; and the Emperour commanded all his Regiments to be compleated and augmented, his Garriſons to be fortified, and his Magazins to be filled for the better oppoſing ſo powerful an Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt both parties are preparing for a War with great Vigour, it will be conducible enough to the deſign of our Hiſtory, to ſubjoyn an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which had like to have made an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute breach betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Port. <hi>Monſieur du Queſne,</hi> having given chace to ſeven <hi>Corſairs</hi> of <hi>Tripoly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> force the <hi>Tripolins</hi> into the Haven of <hi>Chio.</hi>
                     </note> forced them into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Chio,</hi> placing themſelves under the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Fortreſs, to cover themſelves from the Enemy, but to no purpoſe, although the Governour of the Place ſent the <hi>French</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral word, that they were under the Protection of the Grand Seignior; for <hi>Monſieur du Queſne,</hi> in proſecution of his Deſign, when he was come up with them, fired upon them, the Governour did the ſame upon the <hi>French,</hi> but to no great purpoſe, being they were ſo ill treated, that three of their Veſſels were diſabled, and all of them forced under the very Walls of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, one of the Baſtions of the ſame being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe almoſt ruined. <hi>Du Queſne</hi> not yet ſatisfied, blocked them up there, until the News thereof was come to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Alarm was great there, and they were upon the point of falling upon them of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, untill their Ambaſſadour there declared, that what was done, was in no wiſe acted againſt the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Port, but only againſt the aforeſaid <hi>Corſairs,</hi> who took the Veſſels belonging to his Maſters Subjects, and therefore ought not to be received into the Grand Seigniors Ports. Though this did for the preſent in ſome ſort appeaſe them, yet the <hi>Capitain Baſſa</hi> was ſent to <hi>Chio</hi> with eight and forty Gallies, to make a Peace betwixt the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Tripolins;</hi> much time was ſpent
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:39539:139"/>before it could be effected, which being conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they of <hi>Tripoli</hi> had liberty to repair their Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>For all this the <hi>Ottomans</hi> were highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dammage <hi>Du Queſne</hi> had done at <hi>Scio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Grand Seignior highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thereat.</note> and demanded reparation from the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who at firſt would give no hearing to ſuch frivolous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, but fearing the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in <hi>Turkey</hi> might be incommoded by it, he ſince offered to make them a Preſent of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, not by any order from the King his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The Turks judging the ſaid Preſent too ſmall, were in no wiſe ſatisfied with it; ſo that the Ambaſſador thought fit to make ſome addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, which did as little ſatisfie them. In the mean time <hi>Du Queſne</hi> being ſailed out of the <hi>Archipelague,</hi> there came an Officer to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, telling him, that the Grand Seignior was in no wiſe ſatisfied with his Offer, as being in no wiſe proportionable to the dammage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at <hi>Scio,</hi> adding, that the whole Empire was offended at it: But yet in conſideration of the ancient Amity betwixt the two Nations, they would paſs it by, provided the dammage were repaired, alledging by way of ſimilitude, that if our party ſued a Thief into a Friends Houſe, and that ſorhething were broke in it, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer would be obliged to pay it. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor replyed, that the harm which was done at <hi>Scio</hi> might be repaired with leſs than what he had already offered of his own, which was more than he could well bear, and that the Grand Seignior and Great Viſier ought to be ſatisfied, that he ruined himſelf to conſerve the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Empires, becauſe he much fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, leſt the Preſent he had offered might not pleaſe the King his Maſter, to whom he never, had made any mention of it. The Turkiſh Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer hereupon being angry, told him in the Name of the Grand Seignior and Great Viſier, that they were reſolved to put him into the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Towers,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Merchants in Priſon; the <hi>Port</hi> knew very well that the <hi>French</hi> King did never diſapprove of what his Ambaſſadors did. The Grand Seignior and his Viſier were not to be mocked by a preſent of a few Clocks, Watches, Stuffs, and Diamonds of ſmall value, in compenſation of dammages of ſeven hundred <hi>Purſes,</hi> ariſing for the murther of 400 Turks, the ruine of a whole City, the deſtruction of many <hi>Moſques,</hi> and the Caſtle. The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor replyed, that he was not at all ſurpriſed at his Choler, but that he ſhould have been afraid if he had ſpoke in theſe Terms to the Chiaux, whoſe ſubſtitute he was; that the lives of Turks had never been valued ſo high; that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſlain at <hi>Scio</hi> was not ſo great, and that there had not been one man killed, if they had not received the Pyrats there with the French Priſes; and finally, if they would put him into the ſeven Towers, he would not come out of it but by expreſs order from the King his Maſter, and that he was ready to follow him thither. The Officer being moved with the Reſolution of the Ambaſſador, aſſured him, he ſhould not fail to be conducted thither the next Morning, whereupon he replyed, he could not believe it, becauſe he knew the Sultan was juſt, the Viſier prudent, and his King a powerful Prince. The Turk interrupting him here, told him, that he talk'd as if he had 100000 men with him, to whom the other added, that his Maſter had 400000 men, and always victorious, and as for him, he ſpoke like one that would be as good as his Word. The Viſier, highly offended with the Ambaſſadors Diſcourſe, cauſed him to be told by a <hi>Kiaia,</hi> that he muſt add to his Preſent, or that he ſhould be obliged for his Reputation to ſend him to the ſeven Towers: but the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador continued poſitive. Sometime after, it was ſignified to him, that the Viſier had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable abatement of the 700 Purſes, and that he would be content, if beſides the Clocks and rarities, he would yet give 40000 Livers in Diamonds; but the Ambaſſador returned an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that in complizance to the Great Viſier, he would yet add 1200 Crowns, and no more. Some time after, the Viſier let him know that he would ſpeak with him himſelf, which the Ambaſſador denied, becauſe he had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed him the <hi>Sofa.</hi> However he did ſo far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as to go to him about the end of <hi>May,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">But is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed.</note> where after many Conteſtations about increaſing the Preſent, the Turks deſcended to 350000, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to 100000 Crowns, to 10000, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally agreed upon 15000 Livers. The Turkiſh Officers having had the moſt trouble in the World ſo to content the Grand Viſier that the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador ſhould not be diſpleaſed. A few days after, the Moneys, together with the Preſents, conſiſting of a ſmall thread of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, two — a <hi>Venice</hi> Looking-glaſs,<note place="margin">Fautevil.</note> five Chamber Clocks, one Carpet, ten embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Habits, ſome pieces of Cloth, Satins, and other Stuffs were exhibited, whereby this affair of <hi>Scio</hi> was accommodated, but not the difference about the <hi>Sopha,</hi> which continues ſtill.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour being ſufficiently ſatisfied of the Deſigns of the Mahometans upon <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> order'd all his Collonels to compleat their Regiments by the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> and gave out new Commiſſions for ſix Regiments of Horſe, and ſeveral of Foot to be raiſed with all imaginable ſpeed. Theſe Levies were not only deſigned to reinforce the Army of <hi>Hungary,</hi> but alſo to incamp near <hi>Vienna,</hi> to cover that City and the Neighbouring Countries from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the Turks. He further commanded the Peaſants of all the Neighbouring Villages to cut down Oaks to make Pallizadoes, and to carry them to <hi>Vienna</hi> for the repairing of the Fortifications of that City. The Inhabitants of the Suburbs had likewiſe order to empty their Cellars, that they might be filled with Earth, but deferred the pulling down of the Houſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they were aſſured that the City ſhould be beſieged. Ambaſſadors being alſo ſent to the Electors, the Circles, and Princes of the Empire, to invite them to joyn with his Imperial Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty for the Preſervation of <hi>Hungary. Conte Albret Caprara</hi> received likewiſe order to return from his Embaſſie, unleſs he could obtain a Prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Trevis; but the Grand Seignior would not ſuffer him to depart, but obliged him to follow him to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and thence to <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> cauſing him to be obſerved with much exactneſs. In the mean time, as alſo the whole Winter, the Citizens of <hi>Vienna</hi> had been trained and exerciſed with great diligence, the better to enable them to reſiſt, in caſe of a Siege, which their fears and the Enemies braggings gave them juſt occaſion to apprehend. They alſo were commanded to lay up Proviſions for twelve Months; and not only they, but all the frontier Places were ſtored with Magazins, the Iſle of <hi>Schut</hi> was alſo fortified, where it was expoſed to the Enemies Surpriſes, and a Regiment of Foot added to defend the entry againſt the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. There was alſo a great Redoubt made on the further ſide the <hi>Danube</hi> to cover the Bridge lately made, and to favour a retreat in caſe of neceſſity. At the ſame time there happened a Skirmiſh betwixt the <hi>Huſſars</hi> of the Gariſon of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:39539:139"/>
                     <hi>Comorra, Papa, Veſprin,</hi> and <hi>Raab,</hi> againſt a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the Army of the Turks, who loſt 1200 men in the Encounter.<note place="margin">The Plague rages in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                     </note> But if the Wars cauſed great ruines in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Plague laid it well nigh deſolate; it raged in <hi>Caſſovia</hi> about <hi>Papa,</hi> and in many places poſſeſſed by the Turks; inſomuch that <hi>Tekely</hi> was obliged to retire to <hi>Montcats</hi> to his Wife, and to chuſe another Place than <hi>Caſſovia</hi> to convene the Diet which he had ſummoned. He had by Ceſſations and Treaties kept the Imperial Court in ſuſpenſe, propoſing his Mediation at the Port for a Prolongation of the twenty years <hi>Trevis,</hi> for which end he ſent <hi>Schirmay</hi> his Secretary with others thither. Nay, the Propoſitions he made were thought ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that the Baron <hi>Zaponara</hi> was ſent with new inſtructions to carry on this Peace as well with <hi>Tekely,</hi> as with the Viſier of <hi>Buda;</hi> but whether <hi>Tekely,</hi> inſtead of advancing this Affair, did not retard it, or that the Turks would not conſent to any further Prolongation of peace with the Emperour, this commerce vaniſhed. This laſt Obſtacle was ſooner believed than the other, by reaſon of the detention of <hi>Caprara</hi> in <hi>Turky,</hi> and the vaſt Preparations of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> who would liſten to no Ceſſation but upon Terms ſo diſadvantageous that his Imperial Majeſty could in no ways aſſent to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zaponara,</hi> who had ſpent much time with <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely,</hi> being returned the beginning of <hi>January</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> reported, that the Count <hi>Tekely</hi> having been ſick at <hi>Montcatz,</hi> he had entertained many fruitleſs Conferences with him, and now he was well, and ſeeing no hopes of an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation with a man who was entirely engaged with the Turks, as was viſible by all this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he could continue there no longer. And this gained credit by the appearing of a certain project granted by the Grand Seignior to the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> which we will alſo inſert, to ſatisfie the curious, though we dare not aſſure them that it was exactly ſuch:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>That the Count</hi> Emmeric Tekely <hi>of</hi> Rits<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>of the Illuſtrious Houſe of</hi> Gabriel Bethelem, <hi>ſhall be inſtalled King of</hi> Hungary, <hi>and in caſe he come to dye, the Grand Seignior will take the Queen his Wife, as well for her Perſon as Goods, into his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>

                        </item>
                        <item>3. <hi>That the Preſent, which the</hi> Hungarians <hi>have promiſed to give to the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Port, ſhall never be raiſed in any manner whatſoever.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. <hi>That they ſhall entirely enjoy their Priviledges, Liberties, Immunities, and Franchiſes for ever, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diminution.</hi>

                        <item>5. <hi>That they ſhall be protected by the</hi> Turks <hi>from all their Enemies, who, or whatſoever.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>6. <hi>That the Turks will religiouſly obſerve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace made with the</hi> Germans <hi>at St.</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thard, <hi>ſo far as they concern</hi> Hungary.</item>

                        </item>
                        <item>11. <hi>And finally, the Preſent of</hi> 40000 <hi>Crowns, ſhall, as is already mentioned, never be augmented.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe and ſeveral other Paſſages fill'd the Imperial Court with diffidence, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tekely</hi>'s fair words, and yet the Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſtill continued, the Emperour having propoſed to an <hi>Officer</hi> that <hi>Tekely</hi> had ſent him, to grant to his Maſter the Soveraignty of all he poſſeſſed in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> with ſeveral other Demeanes, ſo willing they were to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached this ſubtile and brave Enemy from his intelligence with the Turks, who at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that he could not ſeparate his Intereſts from the Port, which obliged <hi>Hoffman</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponara</hi> to retire.</p>
                  <p>The 18 of <hi>January,</hi> 6000 Turks entred into <hi>Caniſia,</hi> moſt Janizaries, and the Gariſons of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade</hi> and <hi>Newhauſel</hi> were alſo augmented with great numbers of this Militia. The <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,</hi> 5000 <hi>Tartars</hi> arrived at <hi>Buda,</hi> who were ſent to <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and 12000 Foot came in their place, who by reaſon they could not lodge in the City, encamped at the foot of the Walls.</p>
                  <p>Upon this News order was given to break the Ice round the Iſle of <hi>Schults</hi> to keep the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver open, the better to oppoſe their irruptions of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Malecontents.</hi> The Ice, which was of an extraordinary thickneſs, broke the wooden Bridge at <hi>Vienna,</hi> with the loſs of three Charets loaden with Wine and Oates, which fell in. The Inhabitants of the aforeſaid Iſle of <hi>Schults</hi> were by reaſon of the oppreſſion of the Inpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts forc'd moſtly to abandon it; the noiſe whereof being ſpread through the Kingdom, had like to have cauſed a general Inſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The beginning of <hi>February,</hi> the Turks entred into the Iſle of <hi>Serin</hi> in <hi>Croatia,</hi> where they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great diſorders. One of their parties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated a Convoy with Munitions of War, and other proviſions deſigned for <hi>Zendra, Loſſenhilts</hi> who commanded the ſame, being ſlain.</p>
                  <p>The Turks, who provided all things neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to attempt the ſiege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> laid in at <hi>Buda</hi> vaſt ſtores of Ammunition and Materials to make Bridges of; nor were they leſs vigilant on the other ſide, the Suburbs were demoliſhed round within a hundred paces of the City, and the great Iſland was fortified and put into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to lodge a whole Army. Redoubts were built at both ends of the wooden Bridge, which is on the ſide neareſt the City, and the Bridge which traverſed the great Arm of the <hi>Danube</hi> was taken down to build another on the other ſide of the Favorites, with ſeveral other ſmall Forts for its ſecurity: Two hundred thouſand pallizadoes were ſent from <hi>Newburg</hi> to ſerve for the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of <hi>Vienna,</hi> whereof every Citizen under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to maintain a Souldier well armed in caſe the City ſhould be beſieged. All Boats were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtopped at <hi>Vienna,</hi> being deſigned to tranſport Proviſions and Ammunition into <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However <hi>Tekely</hi> continued to block up the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which remained in the Emperours Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> and to ſhut up the Paſſages that no relief might be ſent to them; he did not ceaſe howſoever to teſtifie to the Deputies of the Loyal Countries, that he did deſire with Paſſion that his Imperial Majeſty would grant him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conditions, that might reſtore him to the obedience which he owed him; and to make it appear to all the World, that he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Armns againſt him out of any animoſity, he releaſed an hundred <hi>German</hi> Priſoners without Ranſom, and ſent to aſſure the Emperour, that he had diſpatched <hi>Fagou</hi> and <hi>Sirmay,</hi> his two chief Miniſters, to the Port to endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:39539:140"/>a prolongation of the Trevis. He ſpake to the ſame purpoſe at the Diet he had convened, and releaſed yet again eighty Priſoners which he had taken at <hi>Tokay,</hi> and gave Count <hi>Herber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> his Liberty upon his parole.</p>
                  <p>The Turks, about the later end of <hi>February,</hi> made a new attempt upon the Iſle of <hi>Schults</hi> with 1000 men of the Garriſon of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Renegade; but the Ice, which was not ſtrong enough, breaking, a great number of them were drowned: the Imperialiſts took many Priſoners, and amongſt others the Sub-governour of <hi>Newhawſel's</hi> Son. A Turkiſh Officer that offered ten thouſand Dollars for his Life had his Head chopt off. At the ſame time ſeveral new Troops of the Infidels arrived, who lodged at <hi>Eſſek,</hi> and along the Rivers <hi>Savus</hi> and <hi>Dravus.</hi> They armed ſeveral <hi>Brigantines,</hi> which vogued upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> to hinder the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts to ſend any Succours or Ammunition to their Garriſons. The Baffa of <hi>Belgrade</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved orders to repair an ancient Palace ſeated upon a Hill near the Town, to lodge the Grand Seignior there, who deſigned to ſtay there during the Campania.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>March, Tekely,</hi> with a conſiderable body of the Turkiſh and his own Troops, endeavoured to Surpriſe <hi>Tirnaw,</hi> to cut off the Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Fortreſs of <hi>Leopolſtat,</hi> with the River <hi>Waagh.</hi> But this Enterpriſe failing, this Count ſummoned a ſecond Diet in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> though thoſe of the Loyal Counties were admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed not to appear there. At the ſame time Collonel <hi>Albert Caprara</hi> advertiſed the Emperour, that the Grand Seignior offered to prolong the Ceſſation if he would ſurrender to him the Iſles of <hi>Schults,</hi> of <hi>Serin,</hi> and of <hi>Raab,</hi> with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Comorra;</hi> but his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty did not think it expedient to accept of ſuch diſadvantageous Terms, which rendered the Turks entire Maſters of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and gave them an open paſſage to the very Walls of <hi>Vienna.</hi> After that, it was impoſſible for this Miniſter to write any more to his Maſter, for the Turks kept ſo ſtrict a Guard about him, that he was ſuffered to have no Communication with any, for fear of informing the Emperour with the vaſt preparations of War which were made in all the extent of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p>The Turks at the ſame time ſurpriſed a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Dragoons, kill'd forty, and took ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priſoners; they lodged 15000 men in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Eſſek,</hi> to hinder the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts from burning the Bridge, and by that means hinder their Paſſage into the lower <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.</hi> The Emperour on the other ſide cauſed all his Forces on the ſide of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> except four Regiments which he left for the Frontiers, to march towards <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Hungary.</hi> His Troops alſo that were in <hi>Bohemia</hi> under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Count <hi>Taff,</hi> were commanded that way.</p>

                  <p>The Grand Seignior ſhewed ſo much paſſion for the War of <hi>Hungary,</hi> that to complement him, all the Miniſters of the Court would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly contribute to it.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:39539:140"/>to draw towards <hi>Presburg,</hi> where Count <hi>Rabata</hi> encamped them as they came, according to the orders he had received from his Imperial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who had choſen the great Plain of <hi>Kirtzer,</hi> joyning to that City to take the general review of his Army, which being drawn into Batalia in two Lines, extended four Miles in length; ſeventy two pieces of Cannon, with the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Artillery, Count <hi>Starenberg,</hi> were placed at the head of the Infantry, which was ranged in Batalions, and in ſuch order that they might be perceived on both ſides; they were numbered 20000, and the Horſe in two Wings amounted to 12000, beſides 5000 <hi>Huſſars</hi> drawn up on the Right of the <hi>German</hi> Horſe with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen field pieces.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour arrived in the Camp about Ten of the Clock, preceded by his Guards, and riding between the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> being followed by many other Princes and Lords, and ſaluted with three Vollies of all the Cannon and Muſqueteers of the Army. After Maſs, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Strigonium</hi> read with a loud Voice the Bull of Indulgence, accorded to ſuch who ſhould fight againſt Infidels, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given his Benediction to their Imperial Majeſties, who received it on their Knees, and conſequently to all the Army, this Prince cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed 500000 Livers to be diſtributed amongſt the Souldiery, which was no leſs acceptable to them. The Command of the Forces being given to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> as Generaliſſimo, the Right wing was conducted by the Duke of <hi>Sax-Lawenburg,</hi> the Left by General <hi>Caprara,</hi> and the Infantry and Cannon by the Count of <hi>Starenberg.</hi> With this Army thus compoſed moſt of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour's old and beſt Souldiery, and under ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert a General as the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> the Court hoped for ſomewhat extraordinary, though as it will appear they were diſappointed in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation. In the mean time a Council of War was held to ſee what might be done before the arrival of the Turks, and after what manner they ſhould act upon the Defenſive when the Enemy did appear. All agreed that for the Offenſive there was nothing to be attempted but <hi>Gran</hi> or <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and that, as they ought to avoid thoſe Enterpriſes which would coſt much Blood, and weaken the Army, ſo they ſeemed to point at <hi>Gran</hi> as moſt eaſie, though others were for <hi>Newhauſel</hi> for ſeveral Reaſons. For the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive, it was concluded they muſt endeavour to defend the Paſſages of the Rivers <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Waagh.</hi> The reſult of this Council being refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Emperour, he judged, that for the Reputation of his Arms, and other important Reaſons, not to ſuffer his Army to lye idle the ſpace of two Months time, which they had before the Enemy could take the field, but left the choice to the Duke, whether he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Gran</hi> or <hi>Newhauſel?</hi> He only recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him, that when the Turks advanced he ſhould take care for the ſecurity of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and oppoſe as much as in him lay the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ravaging of the Hereditary Countries.</p>
                  <p>The Army being advanced near <hi>Comorra,</hi> the Duke having no certain Intelligence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of <hi>Gran,</hi> reſolved in perſon to take a view of the Place, which he did, but being upon the point to reſolve its Siege, he was advertiſed that the Turks were forming a Camp at <hi>Buda,</hi> and judging that they might from thence relieve <hi>Gran</hi> by Water, (as the Baſſa of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> had already done upon the news of the Chriſtians Deſign to attempt the place) and perhaps cut off the Communication betwixt him and <hi>Comor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> by poſting themſelves betwixt this Place and <hi>Gran,</hi> he quitted the thoughts of that Enterpriſe, reſolving upon the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choice left him.</p>
                  <p>This Reſolution being taken,<note place="margin">June <hi>3.</hi>

The Turks ſeeing this, ſet the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs on fire to prevent the Chriſtians approach, who notwithſtanding planted their battery, and were advanced within an hundred paces of the body of the Place, with little loſs ſave that of Count <hi>Taxis,</hi> and might probably have given a good account of the Siege, if the Court, which diſapproved the Enterpriſe, had not ſent orders for them to retire. This command was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately obeyed, and not without ſome Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, the Army returning to their old Camp betwixt <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Comorra.</hi> The ſudden rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Siege ſeemed ſtrange to ſome, being the Turkiſh Army was not yet ready to appear, and that the Chriſtians were ſo forward in their approaches. But the more diſcerning thought otherwiſe, becauſe this Town, being ſtrong and well furniſhed with all things, the obſtinacy of the Beſieged might have wearied the Imperial Troops, and have reduced them to an Inability of being able to oppoſe the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army when they came into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and that therefore it was better chuſing the certain, than the hazard of that which was not ſo, as was the taking of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and to keep upon the Defenſive, the rather being the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was not ready, nor yet raiſed; and therefore the Imperial Army, upon whoſe Valour depended the Preſervation of <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Auſtria,</hi> was in no wiſe to be weakned or baffled.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having refreſhed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for ſome time, advanced with all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the ſide of <hi>Raab,</hi> having given orders to haſten the Works at <hi>Leopolſtat,</hi> and repair the Fortifications of <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Comorra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Turkiſh Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of all the Nations under their Obedience, conſiſting of 200000 Men, advanced into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Alba-Regalis,</hi> ſending 4000 Pioneers before them to dig Pits and Wells in their paſſage to furniſh all the Army with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Grand Viſier himſelf having paſſed the Bridge of <hi>Eſſek</hi> with the body of his Army, moved towards the Chriſtian Camp by <hi>Raab,</hi> with a Reſolution to attack it inſtantly, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to a general Battel; his Army was ſo numerous that they covered the whole Country from <hi>Alba</hi> even to the Mountains of <hi>Raab,</hi> and being come within a League of the Imperialiſts, he detached a great number of <hi>Tartars</hi> to ſpoil and ravage the Country out of which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians could receive any Subſiſtence or Forage, which extremely augmented their wants, which were already but too great.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Seignior arriving at <hi>Belgrade</hi> the Third of <hi>June,</hi> the Sultan Queen would not ſtay behind, but accompanied his Highneſs in his Voyage of <hi>Hungary.</hi> At <hi>Belgrade</hi> he received an Expreſs from the <hi>Caimacan,</hi> of a great fire at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> which had intirely conſumed one of the quarters of the City, and that the Grand Viſier's Seraglio had been quite burnt if the neighbouring Houſes had not been pulled down to ſave that ſumptuous Building.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Takely</hi> having taken his meaſures from the Grand Viſier, upon whom he had waited, and concerted with him concerning the following Campania, being returned to <hi>Caſſovia,</hi> publiſhed
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:39539:141"/>a Manifeſt in the Grand Seignior's and his own Name, that all the <hi>Hungarians</hi> that would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Party, ſhould be maintained in their Priviledges, Liberties, Goods, Laws, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but that ſuch who refuſed to ſubmit, ſhould have no quarter. This Manifeſt had the deſired effect, for the Cities of <hi>Papa, Tot,</hi> and <hi>Veſprin,</hi> the moſt remote, immediately opened their Gates to the <hi>Tekeliſts.</hi> The Emperour, fearing that <hi>Neutra</hi> would follow the Example of theſe three Places, commanded Count <hi>Schults</hi> the Governour, to draw forth the great Guns, the Arms and Stores, and to quit the Place. The ſame Orders were given to the Hilly Cities, and to the Officers of the Silver Mines, who all obeyed; a Conduct ſo extraordinary alarmed all <hi>Hungary.</hi> The Cities and Counties declared to the Emperours Commiſſioners, that they would open their Gates to Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Fire and Pillage, being there was no hopes of Succours. To all this, the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> under their Palatine <hi>Eſterhaſi</hi>'s Command, who guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Paſſages of the River <hi>Waagh,</hi> about 15000 in number deſerted likewiſe, putting themſelves under the Protection of <hi>Tekeley,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſo that this Palatine with ſcarce a competent Guard, was forced to retire to <hi>Vienna,</hi> becauſe he would not violate his Faith ſworn to the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the two Armies did nothing material, but obſerve each other, a great Body of <hi>Tartars</hi> under the Conduct of their Cham, who was there in Perſon, animated with the hopes of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, having examined the Avenues and Fords of the River <hi>Raab,</hi> by following it towards its ſource, paſſed over by ſwimming their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and guided by ſome <hi>Hungarians,</hi> they came to <hi>Kerment</hi> and St. <hi>Godthard,</hi> a place famous for the memorable Victory which the Chriſtians gained from the Turks nineteen years paſt, far from finding any Obſtacles to hinder them, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing ſeem'd to favour their Paſſage. Count <hi>Badiani</hi> abandoned his poſt upon the River, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Tekely</hi> thoſe <hi>Hungarians</hi> he command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that the Enemy entered the Country like a torrent, putting all to Fire and Sword; and paſſing the <hi>Rabwitz,</hi> continued their Devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> finding the Enemy on both ſides, and fearing leſt they might cut off his way to <hi>Vienna</hi> and the Hereditary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, having reinforced the Gariſons of <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Comorra,</hi> reſolved to retire with the reſt not exceeding 24000. And to the end the march of the Horſe might not be retarded by the Foot and Artillery, they were ſeparated, the Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Canon marching along the Iſle of <hi>Schut,</hi> the way on the left ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to little Danger; from thence they came ſafe to <hi>Presburg</hi> and <hi>Thebes,</hi> and paſſing the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Mark,</hi> arrived happily at <hi>Vienna.</hi> The Duke, having paſſed the Bridge of <hi>Raab</hi> with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, marched to <hi>Altembourg,</hi> where he reſted ſome time, expoſing this little Town to the Pillage of his Souldiers, as being loth to let their Cattel and Proviſions fall into the Enemies Hands, which would infallibly happen. The Inhabitants however ſeemed very diſſatisfied to be ſo uſed by their Friends, though the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the Enemy, who ravaged all with Fire and Sword, effaced the other ill, as wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable: from thence having paſſed the Streight there, they marched towards the Plains of <hi>Kitz</hi> or <hi>Kitzer,</hi> where two Months before the general review of the Army was made.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara Muſtapha,</hi> the Great Viſier, attributing this retreat of the Chriſtians to their fear, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Council, where it was deliberated whether he ſhould purſue them, or undertake the Siege of <hi>Raab?</hi> But judging, according to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that their retreat was no better than a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, it was reſolved to purſue them; whereupon he preſently raiſed his Camp, and followed the way the Chriſtians were gone, leaving a body of 12000 near the ſaid <hi>Raab,</hi> to ſecure his Convoys and Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>The Duke perceiving their deſign, and not judging himſelf in affurance in the Plains of <hi>Kitz</hi> againſt ſo formidable a power, reſolved to march towards <hi>Vienna.</hi> He ſent Count <hi>Aeneas Caprara,</hi> General of his Horſe, to acquaint the Emperour with it, and inform him of all things. The Duke following, had ſent his Baggage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but it happened, that a Troop of <hi>Tartars,</hi> mingled with <hi>Turks,</hi> and conducted by <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> to the number of 3000 in all, having ſwum over the River <hi>Leithe,</hi> and hid themſelves in a Wood betwixt the Villages of <hi>Petronel</hi> and <hi>Elend,</hi> fell ſuddenly upon them, and attacking ſome Regiments on the left Wing, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Baggage, with dreadful cryes and howlings, did ſo ſurprize them with the terrour of ſo unexpected an irruption, that it brought them all into confuſion, and by reaſon of the Duſt, which was ſo thick that they could not diſtinguiſh Friend from Foe, not knowing which way to turn, they broke their Ranks, and communicated their Diſorder to the very Regiments that followed. In the mean time theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> taking the ordinary Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of their impetuouſneſs, flew ſome of them upon the <hi>Pedees,</hi> Carters, and Servants, which they ſacrifice to their Cruelty and Fury, whilſt the reſt plunder the Chariots and Baggage. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Officers loſt there their Equipages, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others the Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Croy,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas Caprara,</hi> all General Officers, had all their Plate taken away.</p>
                  <p>This Accident put the Army into a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſternation, it could not be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Duke having left the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, this ſame Enemy ſhould poſſibly have got before them, and by ways nearer and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er intercept, and ſo boldly attack their Baggage, which was thought ſecure under the Convoy that guarded it. As ſoon as they had recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and that the Duke had conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſorder part of his Army was in, he ſent freſh Troops to ſecond the firſt, and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt them to repell the <hi>Barbarians;</hi> yet ſo as to avoid a general Engagement, which he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehended. The <hi>Tartars</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> rally, began likewiſe to draw to a head; but the fear to ſee themſelves deprived of their Prey, obliged them to retire, and to run away with no leſs precipitation and ſpeed than they uſed in their Onſet. The Duke cauſed them to be purſued by his Light-Horſe, who took ſome Standards, being unwilling to engage with the groſs of their Troops, as well being this Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſupported by the Avant-guard of the Army, as not to retard his march to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the which he continned afterwards without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. The <hi>Chevalier</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Brother to the Count of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> was loſt in this Confuſion, for being too far advanced with his Dragoons that followed him, a <hi>Tartar</hi> knock'd him from his Horſe with his Sable, and thinking him dead, did alight, and heaving him croſs his Saddle, with his Breaſt upon the Pomel, preſt him ſo there, that he bruiſed his Stomach. A little after, this Prince being relieved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to <hi>Vienna,</hi> and however his Wound in his Head was not mortal, his diſlocated Stomach could not bere-ſet, ſo that he died in a few days.
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:39539:141"/>Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> and Count <hi>Mellini</hi> were ſlain in this ſcuffle, though the common loſs of either ſide was not great.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour, being informed of the preſent State of Affairs by Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> was greatly ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved, not knowing what to do upon ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and preſſing an Occaſion. He immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately cauſed his chief Miniſters to be ſummoned to know their Sentiments, and all unanimouſly counſelled his Majeſty to retire from <hi>Vienna.</hi> They now only deliberate what road or way he ought to take, ſome adviſed he ſhould go over the Mountains without paſſing the <hi>Danube,</hi> and ſo ſtrait to <hi>Campililium,</hi> being the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt way to <hi>Lintz;</hi> but the Enemy being on the ſame ſide of the River, the other was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable, as leſs ſubject to Danger, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purſuits of the Enemies Cavalry, who would make more way in a day, winged with the hopes of ſuch a purchaſe, than the Court could make in four. This laſt advice being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, was ordered to be put in Execution, and all things, as far as was poſſible in ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, prepared for the Journey.</p>
                  <p>The Noiſe of this retreat was quickly made publick. The Waggons which arrived in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to carry the Baggage ſufficiently publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and at the ſame time filled the City and Neighbourhood with ſo much Terror, that it might be thought no body would ſtay when the Emperour was gone. All the Horſes and Carts that could poſſibly be found, were hired to fly away with, many Ladies of Quality being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to put themſelves into deſpicable Carriages, little conformable to their Condition. Houſes ſtored with rich moveables, and furniſhed with Wine, Corn, and all ſort of Proviſions, were abandoned, nothing but what was precious and moſt portative being ſaved. The Air was alſo filled with the Sighs, the Tears, the Lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the Cryes of the Multitude, as if the Enemy had already rendered themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the City.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day,<note place="margin">July <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> being the ſeventh of <hi>July,</hi> about eight at Night, their Imperial Majeſties with the whole Court paſſing through the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace Gate, went over the <hi>Danube,</hi> and lay that Night at <hi>Cronenbourg,</hi> a pleaſant Town two or three miles diſtant from <hi>Vienna,</hi> being guarded by 200 men, who returned to <hi>Vienna</hi> the next Morning. The next day there followed ſuch a prodigious number of Coaches, Carts, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, Horſemen, Foot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to render the City a Deſert. They were thought to amount to 60000, ſo preſſing they were to avoid the danger that ſo eminently threatned them. And yet it was computed, that no fewer ſtay'd behind fit to bear Arms, beſides the Garriſon, the Women and the Children. This flight continued ſeveral days, but thoſe that went laſt, fell for the moſt part into the danger they would avoid, the hands of the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi> Many others did ſo overload their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, that they had ſcarce paſſed the Bridge over the <hi>Danube,</hi> but their Wheels or Axeltrees breaking, they were left in the way in the Night, not knowing whither to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Aversberg,</hi> having been diſpatched by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to the Emperour, to inform him of the ſucceſs of the Battel of <hi>Petronel,</hi> found him at <hi>Cronenbourg,</hi> and greatly rejoyced the whole Court. Upon the firſt News of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments that had been baffled, they had publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Vienna</hi> that the General had been ſlain, the Horſe defeated, and the <hi>Tartars</hi> at the Gates of the City. Thus all were greatly revived, that the Evil was leſs than they had believed it to be.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt their Imperial Majeſties continued their Journey to <hi>Lintz, Lorrain</hi> entred <hi>Vienna,</hi> where his firſt care was to pacifie the Diſorders and Confuſion there.<note place="margin">July <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> Count <hi>Sterenberg</hi> arrived there the ſame day, and immediately fell to work with the Counterſcharp, fortifying the whole Works, and to plant Palizadoes. As they had not apprehended a Siege, the Generals found the more to do. <hi>Lorrain</hi> endeavoured however to provide for all things before the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Enemy,<note place="margin">July <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> who began ſince the <hi>11th</hi> to ſhew their moſt advanced Troops near the City. The ſame day <hi>Starenberg</hi>'s Regiment arrived, as alſo a thouſand commanded Men, who advancing ſwiftly before the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, entred the City.</p>
                  <p>And now they burn the Suburbs,<note place="margin">July <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> which was continued the day following, the Citizens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves carrying Fire into their own Houſes; and in the Evening there was a great Skirmiſh near the Palace called the Favorite, where the Turks advanced to diſcover. All the Infantry arrived the <hi>13th,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">July <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> made them all march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Counterſcharp, except eight Batallions which he retained in the <hi>Tabor,</hi> the better to defend that Poſt where he reſolved to ſtay until the Powder and Bullets expected from <hi>Lintz</hi> were arrived; which being effected, and the Ammunition conducted into the Arſenal,<note place="margin">July <hi>14.</hi>
                     </note> he cauſed the reſt of the Foot to be removed into the Town, together with <hi>Dupigni</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, the whole compoſing a Body of twelve thouſand Men.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> had committed infinite Ravages and Cruelties in that vaſt extent of Countries round <hi>Vienna</hi> for ſeveral Leagues. It is their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to run before the Army, armed only with a Javelin, and to burn and ſack, and ſpread Terror over all where they find no reſiſtance. They kill ſuch as fall into their Hands, or traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick them away as Slaves with the Turks. No place eſcapes their Inhumanity, not the moſt retired Places of Forreſts, the impenetrable Dens of wild Beaſts, or the moſt obſcure retreats of Valleys. There is nothing theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> do not diſcover by means of their Blood-hounds, the uſe whereof is common amonſt them.</p>
                  <p>But now the groſs of the Enemies Army ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, a great number of Waggons, ſome with four Horſes, and others drawn with Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and very many Camels laden with Baggage, began to range themſelves in form of a Croyſent or half Moon about the City, extending from the <hi>Danube</hi> behind St. <hi>Mark,</hi> along the Suburbs of <hi>Leopolſtat,</hi> and the neighbouring Villages, even to <hi>Neudorf.</hi> At the ſame time the Turks opened their Trenches on the ſide of the Imperial Gate, and lodged there in ſpight of the Cannon of the Town that endeavoured to hinder them.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> having ordered Affairs at <hi>Vienna,</hi> retired with his Horſe and Dragoons over the Bridges, and camp'd there; he would gladly have kept ſome Foot with him, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſidered the greatneſs of the Enemies Strength, the Works that were to be made, the diſtance of Supplies, and the diminution which the continuance of a Siege would make in the Garriſon, he reſolved to leave all his Infantry with the Governour, who moſt earneſtly deſired it.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, before he left <hi>Vienna,</hi> had deſigned to continue in the <hi>Tabor,</hi> (or Iſle of St. <hi>Leopold</hi>) and ſo conſerve the Communication with the City. <hi>Tabor</hi> is an Iſland of a League and a half long, environed with the <hi>Danube.</hi> This Iſle is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:39539:142"/>full of Houſes of Pleaſure, Gardens, and Groves. But upon a true Survey of the Place, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not think it defenſible, the Waters being ſo low, that the Arm of the River which formed this Iſle was almoſt every where forda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo that whole ſquadrons might paſs at once without breaking their Ranks: for this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reaſons, the Iſle being likewiſe expoſed to the Enemies Artillery, they were obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Turks by this time had pitch'd an infinite number of Tents about the City, and making a lodgement in <hi>Rottenhoffs</hi> Garden, where they had firſt opened their Trenches, and raiſed a great Battery, they thundered without ceaſing to favour their Works, which they continued winding and turning. The beſieged on their ſide covered themſelves with Gabions and ſacks of Earth to hinder the effect of the Enemies Cannon; they alſo raiſed a good Battery on that ſide, and all the Engineers and moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Officers being diſtributed into the ſeveral Poſts, were continually employed to render their Cannon ſerviceable, and fortifie the Places the moſt expoſed to the Enemies Fire, which coſt many of them their Lives,</p>
                  <p>The Turks, moved to ſee that the Chriſtians were Maſters of the Bridges, made an attempt to force <hi>Conte Schultz</hi> who had the guard of them. This General ſeeing his forlorn and advanced Guards preſſed, he ſent other Troops to ſuſtain them; but the Infidels having already a great body in the Iſle of <hi>Tabor,</hi> the Chriſtians were forced to fly over the Bridge. The Enemy planted their Standards there, but the Cannon loaden with Cartrages flanking that place, and the ſwift firing of the Dragoons, ranged along that Arm of the <hi>Danube,</hi> conſtrained them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, though themſelves were expoſed to the Enemies great and ſmall ſhot. The Dragoons preſſed them with ſo much violence in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that they took their Colours. The Turks upon this occaſion loſt a Baſſa, and many of their Janizaries. General <hi>Schultz</hi> himſelf was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, as alſo the <hi>Conte</hi> of <hi>Salsburg,</hi> and a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Major ſlain. In the mean time the Turks, having poſſeſſed themſelves of St. <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Iſle, ſhut up the City on all ſides. They made Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es upon that Arm of the <hi>Danube</hi> which runs next the City, not only to communicate with their Camp, but to hinder the deſcent of Boats They burnt the <hi>Favorite,</hi> and reduced all the Palaces of the Grandees to Aſhes. As ſoon as the heat of firing began to ceaſe in the Suburbs, the Turks filled them with Janizaries, ſo that none could enter or go out of the City; which much troubled the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who could no more give or receive Intelligence from the beſieged, though ſo near and in ſight of them.</p>
                  <p>The Camp of twelve thouſand Men which the Grand Viſier had left near <hi>Raab</hi> to favour the Convoys, continued there ſtill under the command of the Baſſa of <hi>Buda;</hi> but he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Prince <hi>Abaffi,</hi> being himſelf obliged to go to the Siege of <hi>Vienna.</hi> There was alſo a Camp almoſt always betwixt <hi>Fickem</hi> and <hi>Altem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> upon the ſame account, that is, to keep open and aſſiſt the Paſſage of Convoys which came from <hi>Buda,</hi> and the Neighbouring Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Turks being poſted in St. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrick</hi>'s Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs, run their Trenches within fifty paces of the Counterſcharp and Batteries. They alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced their Cannon there, but before they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged them, they cauſed a little Bag of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, carried upon the Spur by two <hi>Spahies,</hi> to be thrown into the Counterſcharp. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Letter from the Grand Vizier, written in the Latin and Turkiſh Languages, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication whereof follows.</p>

                        <p>TO You, Generals, Governours, and Noble Citizens of <hi>Vienna,</hi> We make known by theſe Preſents, according to the Orders we have received from the moſt Serene, moſt Mighty, moſt Redoubted, and the Mightieſt Emperour of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, our Maſter, the true Image of God upon Earth, who, by the Grace of the moſt High, in imitation of our holy Prophet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet Muſtapha,</hi> to whom be Honour, Glory, and Benediction, hath render'd himſelf, by the multitude of his Miracles, the greateſt of all the Sovereigns of the one and th'other World, and most Auguſt of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, who, having cauſed our innumerable Armies, protected always by Divine Providence, to come hither, We are reſolved to take <hi>Vienna,</hi> and eſtabliſh there the Cult of our Divine Religion; 'tis therefore, that before we draw our fatal Cymetars, as our chief End is the Propagation of the <hi>Muſſelman Faith,</hi> and that is expreſly commanded us by the Laws of our <hi>Holy</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, firſt and before all things, to exhort you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace our <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> we do hereby advertiſe you, that if you will cauſe your ſelves to be inſtructed in our Myſteries, you will find the Salvation of your Souls therein: If you will deliver up your City without fighting, whether you are young, or more advanced in years, Rich or Poor, we aſſure you that you may all live there peaceably. If any deſire to quit the place, and go live elſewhere, no harm ſhall be done him in his Perſon or Goods, and he ſhall be conducted with his Family and Children whither he pleaſes.

                  <p>The Turks continued to deepen their Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to four foot, and ſhot many Bombs, but without any conſiderable effect, moſt of them burſting in the Air, except ſome few, which falling near the Walls, burnt an old Play-houſe, which being of Wood, it was feared leſt the Flames ſhould reach the Convent and Church of the <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> which occaſion'd its ſudden demoliſhing.</p>
                  <p>There happened alſo another Accident, but more dangerous. The Fire having ſeized upon the <hi>Scots</hi> Church, conſumed that ſtately Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as alſo the Houſe of <hi>Frendorf,</hi> lately perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioned by the Biſhop of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> Suffragan to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Vienna.</hi> The flame proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Arſenal, full of Powder and Muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of War, which would have proved fatally ruinous, if <hi>Conte Serin</hi> had not cauſed the Gate, which they had in vain attempted to unlock, to be broken open, and immediately removed the Powder, which a few moments delay would have rendred impoſſible. But on the other ſide, they could not hinder the Fire to conſume the Palaces of <hi>Aversberg, Traun,</hi> and <hi>Palſi,</hi> which were reduced to Aſhes. A Boy of ſixteen years old, habited like a Girl, was accuſed as guilty of this burning, being found thereabouts, who was by the enraged People immediately pull'd in pieces, ſo that the truth by this precipitated death could not be made known. This Fire continued three days, which if it had feiſed the Powder in the Arſenal, as in the year 1629, the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:39539:142"/>Turks might eaſily have entred that way into the City.</p>
                  <p>Since this Accident, the Infidels ſhot that way that they ſaw the flame appear, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ruine the Court and the Lyon Baſtions, with the Ravelin betwixt both; but the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged bravely oppoſed them with their Sallies and Countermines. They wanted good En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers in the City, inſomuch that <hi>Haſner,</hi> a Captain of the Garriſon, who from a private Souldier was by his Virtue come to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, being obſerved to note all the faults the Miners committed in their Works, the conduct of them was committed to him, wherein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf with good Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Starenberg,</hi> who was Governour Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, was all this while buſie in repairing the Walls, deepning and palizadoing the Ditches, and in raiſing the Earth which was drawn out of the Ramparts and Retreats, to cover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when the firſt Poſts and Parapets were thrown down, which afterwards contributed much to the defence of the Place.</p>
                  <p>The Turks advanced their Works on the Court and Lebel Baſtions ſide, carrying them on within thirty paces of the Counterſcharp, notwithſtanding the continued fire of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged. They alſo diſcharged their Cannon and Mortars without ceaſing, and intirely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the Emperour's Palace, the Houſes and neighbouring Churches.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Starenberg,</hi> who neglecting the danger, viſited every moment the Poſts, to ſee if his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were faithfully executed; upon his going out of the Court-Bulwark was hurt in the Head with a Brick-bat, which a Cannon bullet had forced. He was immediately carried to his Lodging, and ſo happily cured, that in three days he found himſelf able to quit his Bed and his Chamber; during his hurt, the Count of <hi>Daun</hi> was alſo incapable of acting, being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſick of a violent Fever, which reduced him to extremity; ſo that he was not out of danger before the fourteenth Day of his Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But the Counts <hi>Serin, Souches,</hi> and <hi>Schaffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> Brigadiers of the Garriſon, applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſo much care for the defence of the Place, that the Enemy drew no advantage from this misfortune.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf obliged to remove farther from the City, his firſt care was to moleſt the Enemy. Count <hi>Dunewald,</hi> Lieut. Marſhal of the Field, was ſent to <hi>Krembs</hi> with his Regiment, the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Lodron,</hi> and <hi>Keri, Cravats, Kemgſegs</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Dragoons, were likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched thither, not only to keep the Bridge, which was of great Importance, but to hinder the Enemies Forragers, and oppoſe the Parties of <hi>Tartars</hi> which ravaged about. And here we may wonder at the Politicks of theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants, who burn and ruine all the Forrages, and all the Victuals, which ſhould make them ſubſiſt, and which would have very much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commoded their Army in the diſtreſſes they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lorrain</hi> likewiſe ſent Orders to Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtein,</hi> who was in <hi>Styria,</hi> to advance to the Frontiers on the ſide of the Mountains, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the Enemies. He gave alſo the ſame Orders to the Garriſons of <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Comorra,</hi> and to <hi>Caſtel</hi>'s Dragoons who were at <hi>Newſtat.</hi> He ſent likewiſe to ſurvey <hi>Cloſterneubourg,</hi> which is an Abbey upon the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Turkiſh Camp was but two Leagues off, and according to the report made to him of the Place, he judged it neceſſary to conſerve this Poſt, which he did, by putting Foot into it, the which might deſcend the <hi>Danube</hi> upon occaſion, if the Enemy came to attack them with Cannon.</p>
                  <p>He diſpatch'd an Officer to <hi>Raab,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">July <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Grana</hi> and <hi>Baden,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> brought him with ſo much diligence, that parting from <hi>Raab</hi> at Mid-night, they came in 24 hours to <hi>Presburg,</hi> and the next day to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Leſley</hi> was ſent to <hi>Krembs</hi> to conduct the Artillery thither, and to expect the <hi>Bavarians</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiliaries, thoſe of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Franconia,</hi> and ſome other looſe Regiments in the Empire.</p>
                  <p>After theſe firſt Diſpoſitions, which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the Duke's care, his thoughts more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded the Court, and the relief of <hi>Vienna.</hi> He judged the ſafety of this Place of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that he thought it not fit it ſhould be preſſed, and reduced to Extremity, to ſearch the means of ſaving it. He knew that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs of Negotiations, and the diſtance from whence he was to expect things neceſſary for this grand Enterpriſe, would make him loſe much time, whence he concluded that he could not begin too ſoon. He was not of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, who imagined that the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Vienna</hi> was capable of defending it ſelf againſt ſuch extraordinary Troops, and cauſe the Grand Viſier's Army to periſh, without any Succour. But he knew that the want of Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries do ſometimes produce great Changes in the beſt Reſolutions, that no body could anſwer for the Governour's Life; nor for the principal Officers, nor for the conſtancy of the People, accuſtomed to an eaſie Life, and who had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen the Wars but in paint. He knew that the Maladies inevitable in Sieges might occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on untoward Accidents. He ſaw the Deſolation of the Emperour's Hereditary Countries, which did daily augment. He heard no other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe but of Places ſacked, and People carried into ſlavery. In this Continuation of Cruelties and Violences, he judged it reaſonable to uſe all means to ſtop the Rapidity of this Torrent. He perſwaded himſelf, that being at the head of the Army, he ought not to deferr repreſenting all theſe Particulars to the Emperour by ſome Perſon of Merit and Truſt. He gave this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Count <hi>Taff,</hi> whom he diſpatch'd to <hi>Haſſau,</hi> and he continued the ſame Offices during the Siege, for all the Obſtacles and Oppoſitions which he Encountred, whether by the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Paſſages, or the ſlender ſucceſs of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations.</p>
                  <p>The Beſiegers, who had drawn two parallel Lines, the one on the Court Baſtion, and the other on the Lebel ſide, joyned them with another of Communication, and placed above thirty pieces of Battery againſt them. And though <hi>Vienna</hi> was environed with eleven Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Enemy attack'd and battered but three during the whole Siege, which obliged the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to uſe all his care for their defence.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Viſier took his Poſt on that ſide that regarded the Ravelin above-mentioned, with the Aga of the Janizaries, called as he was, <hi>Cara Muſtapha,</hi> his <hi>Kiaia,</hi> and the Baſſa of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia;</hi> this laſt was ſlain with a Cannon bullet. The Attack on the right ſide towards the Court Bulwark was committed to <hi>Huſſan,</hi> the Baſſa of <hi>Damas,</hi> who, though brave, had been bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by Prince <hi>Ragotzki</hi> in <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> by Count <hi>Souches</hi> at <hi>Lewentz,</hi> and by the King of <hi>Poland</hi> at <hi>Cocczin.</hi> This Baſſa was ſeconded by the Seraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quier, Janiſary Aga, or Collonel of all the Foot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Achmet,</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Temiſwar,</hi> commanded the left Attack towards the Lebel Bulwark. He had been <hi>Tefterdar,</hi> and died the Third of <hi>September</hi> of a Dyſſentery. <hi>Huſſan</hi> Baſſa, who had alſo been his Highneſſes Treaſurer, was put in his Place.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall deſignedly pretermit the particulars of this Siege, as to the Approaches, Trenches, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, Minings, Counterminings, Attacks, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Conteſts, though carried on with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Valour and Conſtancy on both ſides, as being particulariſed in the Journals of that Siege in all Languages, and of little or no uſe to my Country-men: And yet I ſhall omit no great Action, nor any thing that may be required of a juſt Hiſtorian.</p>
                  <p>Great was the firing on both ſides, and a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado falling on the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors Palace, reverſed all his Stables. It would have done yet more harm without the Governours Precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who had commanded 250 men, under their particular Officers, to march inceſſantly through the Streets to quench the artificial Fires occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned from their Bombs or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Being, as we mentioned, cloſe ſhut up, <hi>Count, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renberg</hi> was the more deſirous to communicate Councils with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> for which end he offered 100 Duckets to any that would but carry him a Letter, without the hazard of a return, but no man preſented himſelf upon this occaſion; and yet a Spy ſent by the Duke arrived happily in the City, having traverſed the four Branches of the <hi>Danube</hi> with his Letters hanged in a Bladder about his Neck; by theſe the Governour was informed, that he ſhould certainly be relieved, and that the Troops of the Circles of the Empire, and the Hereditary Countries with which the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was at <hi>Olmitz,</hi> was to joyn, did daily arrive. In the mean time ſome Deſerters brought News, and it was ſeen from the top of St. <hi>Stevens</hi> Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the Infidels were making a Bridge of Boats over the <hi>Danube,</hi> a League off, to the end they might paſs when they pleaſed into the Iſle of <hi>Prater.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Leopolſtat.</note> They knew alſo that this Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was given to the Vayvods of <hi>Wallachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> who employed 6000 of their Nation in the Work; but being the Turks ſuſpected them, as being Chriſtians, and that they were forced, the Viſier ordered <hi>Achmet,</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſia,</hi> a City in Natolia, who was camped in this Iſle, and <hi>Chider,</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Boſna,</hi> who had been <hi>Kiaia</hi> to the Sultana <hi>Aſſeki,</hi> to attend their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſecond them with ſix thouſand <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Baron of <hi>Kunitz,</hi> who was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Reſident with the Port, being then in the Camp, ſent one of his Domeſticks with a Letter to Count Starenberg, which was not very hard to do, though the Turks kept a very ſtrict Guard, by reaſon that the Officers and Servants of all the Miniſters which reſided with the Grand Seignior, are habited as Turks, and ſpeak the Language of the Country. The buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was kept ſo little ſecret, that the News be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the next day the ſubject of every Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. This Indiſcretion was the cauſe that they could no more profit by this Advantage, the Turks being advertiſed of this Commerce by their Spies. <hi>Kunitz</hi>'s Servant being ſeiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his return, was brought to the Viſier, and ſeen no more, but without his Letters, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrap'd in wax, he prudently let ſlip into a Ditch, when he ſaw the Turks come towards him.</p>
                  <p>An Order was publiſhed by ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,<note place="margin">July <hi>25.</hi>
                     </note> commanding all Proprietors of Houſes, to keep every one a Man in his Cellar, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken if they could not diſcern any thumping or removing of Earth, becauſe it had been noiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad, that ſome Traitors had promiſed to bring the Enemy through Subterranean Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the City. The ſame day the Turks paſſing ſome great Pieces into <hi>Leopolſtat</hi> upon Boats and Flotes, were diſcovered by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, who play'd upon them with their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non from the Ramparts ſo lukily, that they ſunk two of their largeſt, with a Mortarpiece, which yet did not hinder the reſt to arrive at <hi>Neudorf</hi> and <hi>Erdorf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cannon on both ſides, together with the Mortars, play'd without ceaſing, and though they ruined the prime Buildings in the Town, they hurt or killed but very few. The <hi>24th, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiski,</hi> one of the Engineers, came in great haſte to the Governour, to tell him, that he had ſeen in one of the Shores of the City, ſomewhat that had the Figure of a Man, and that it was to be feared, that the Turks had found a Paſſage, and were entered through this Vault, which diſgor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it ſelf in the <hi>Danube,</hi> and that they deſigned to ſurpriſe the City that way. The Governour, not being yet well recovered of his hurt, ſent <hi>Nit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski</hi> back, with the Baron of <hi>Wels,</hi> his Son-in-Law, and Collonel <hi>Rumblingen,</hi> who was preſent, to examine the matter with care; but being they ſtayed ſomewhat long, the Governour, weak as he was, mounted on Horſeback. Being come to the place, he alighted, and entered himſelf, notwithſtanding the infectious ſmells, into the hole, having ſearched all about with Torches, he found that they were Carkaſſes that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners men had flead. He very ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Authors of this Inhumanity, having accidentally met ſome of them, and returned to his Palace, pleaſantly rallying this Pannick fear with thoſe that accompanied him.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had continued in his Camp by the Bridges of <hi>Vienna</hi> to refreſh his haraſſed Cavalry, from the <hi>16th</hi> to the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> He had there News of the defeat of 800 <hi>Tartars</hi> by a party of a Detachment which Count <hi>Dunewald</hi> Commanded, which render'd theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> more reſerved.</p>
                  <p>The Count <hi>de la Tour,</hi> the Emperours Envoy in <hi>Poland,</hi> came to the ſame Poſt to him, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him, that that Prince promiſed to come to the relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> but that he could not be there before the beginning of <hi>September.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that <hi>Tekely</hi> having aſſembled his Troops near <hi>Tirnau,</hi> deſigned to march to <hi>Presburg,</hi> that the Governour of that Caſtle wavered, and that the City was much ſollicited to receive a Garriſon of the diſcontented <hi>Hungarians;</hi> which obliged him to march along the <hi>Marck</hi> to oppoſe this deſign, and in the interim he ſent 200 men with Major <hi>Okelby,</hi> to endeavour to put them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſaid Caſtle with a Convoy of 300 Horſe for his Security.</p>
                  <p>The Duke diſcamp'd from the Bridges of <hi>Vienna,</hi> having burnt them, leaving notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Regiments of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Ricardi</hi> to preſerve the Forts. Being arrived at the <hi>Mark,</hi> he was informed that <hi>Okelby</hi> with his Convoy were beaten by a party of the <hi>Malecontents;</hi> that the City had received a Garriſon; that they were by order of the Grand Viſier preparing a Bridge for the Communication of both Armies; that <hi>Tekely</hi> had 20000 <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and 8000 <hi>Turks,</hi> commanded by the Baſſa of <hi>Waradin</hi> and <hi>Peſt;</hi> and that he prepared to come and beſiege the Caſtle of <hi>Presburg.</hi> This deſign appeared to the Duke of that conſequence, that he believed himſelf obliged to march thither notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Obſtacles that ſeemed to oppoſe him. This reſolve was however a great while conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. He conſidered the difficulty of the ways, the Enemies Forces much ſuperior to his; the danger of receiving a check, in a time when the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:39539:143"/>Emperours Forces were to be preſerved for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of <hi>Vienna.</hi> On the other ſide, he foreſaw that the Communication of the two Armies at <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> did put the Enemies in a Condition to joyn their Forces to paſs where they pleaſed, and to hinder the Conjunction of the Arms of <hi>Poland,</hi> or oblige them to tedious Circuits. Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations made him determine to oppoſe the Deſigns of <hi>Tekely.</hi> He traverſed the <hi>Marck</hi> the <hi>28th</hi> of <hi>July</hi> with his Horſe and Dragoons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all eight thouſand Horſe, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Poles,</hi> commanded by <hi>Lubomirsky.</hi> A party that appeared a League from the River, was forced back, the Imperialiſts continuing their march to the Lanes that deſcended to <hi>Presburg.</hi> Night being come on, Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Baron <hi>Mercy</hi> were detached with all the Dragoons to force the narrow Paſſages, and gain the tops of the Vineyards, which they did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oppoſition, having a ſight of the Enemy in the plain below. The General upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice came ſpeedily there, from whence he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved two Camps poſted at ſome diſtance from each other. He cauſed his Horſe to advance, which he had left behind the narrow Paſſages, to be ready upon Occaſion, and in the mean time cauſed <hi>Okelby</hi> to enter the Caſtle with two hundred Men, commanded a-new for this Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                  <p>At break of day, the General commanded Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> to inſpect the Suburbs, where ſome Malecontents did appear. Upon his advance, the Enemy retreated into the City, and abandoned the ſaid Suburbs without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
                  <p>This happy Succeſs, and that in ſight of the Enemy, ſeemed an Argument of their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and occaſioned the ſummoning of the Town, which, in the Surpriſe it was, ſeeing the Imperial Army at their Gates, and the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Caſtle reinforced, immediately ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred, deliberating no longer than was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give means to the Garriſon of the Malecontents to retire to their Camp; which did not happen, for one part of them was cut in pieces when they were out, and the other made Priſoners in the Town.</p>
                  <p>After this advantage, the Duke was reſolved to attack the Enemy, who were advanced in Batalia within three quarters of an hour of the City. He gave Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> Orders to ſeiſe with his Dragoons the Vineyards and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens at the head of the Suburbs, and to extend on both hands from the <hi>Danube</hi> to the foot of the Mountain; whilſt the Horſe, commanded by Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> deſcended by the ſame Vineyards to embattel themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Enemy on their ſide made ſome moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of coming up to the Imperialiſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached ſome Parties to begin the Skirmiſh; but the Duke would not Engage them before all his Troops were in Battel-array. As ſoon as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Line was formed, they began to advance; which occaſioned the Malecontents to change their Countenance, for whereas they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, as if deſigning to bring the buſineſs to a Battel, much Duſt appeared in the Rear of their right Wing, as alſo the left, and removed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, which ſeemed to be occaſioned by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring Troops, which alſo proved ſo; all the Line which ſtood oppoſite to the Imperialiſts, wheeling and ſeparating into a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who were on the <hi>Lorrainers</hi> right, and had a Party of <hi>Polanders</hi> in oppoſition to them, finding themſelves preſſed by their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yantguard were intirely routed, being chaſed with conſiderable loſs, until they had gained a Wood, and paſſed a Brook two miles off, they there rallied on the other ſide, and obliged the Troops that had preſſed them to a ſtand. On the left, another detachment of <hi>Poles,</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome <hi>German</hi> Squadrons, and the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Palfi,</hi> charged the Enemy with ſo much Vigour, that having broken them, they kill'd and took betwixt five and ſix hundred of them. They ſeiſed on above a thouſand Waggons with Baggage, and purſued them towards <hi>Tirnau</hi> with ſo much heat, that they forced ſome of them with great Confuſion into the Woods, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Danube.</hi> The fear was ſuch, that they fled on all ſides until they had paſſed the <hi>Waagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tekely,</hi> upon the Advice he had of the march of the Imperialiſts, by the Party he had beaten the Night before, he retired in the Night with the greateſt part of his Horſe and all his Foot, leaving but few of his Men with the Turks, who would retire as he did, reſolving to expect the <hi>Germans.</hi> This Action produced ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding betwixt the <hi>Tekeliſts</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> who ſeparated with little ſatisfaction from each other; but they re-united since by order of the Grand Viſier, as was found by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letters. The Duke in the mean time cauſed the Timber, the Planks, and the Boats prepared for the Conſtruction of the deſigned Bridge to be deſtroyed; and afterwards returned to the <hi>Marck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Siege, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> in the mean time, as alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was bravely carried on; one Day the Turks divertiſed themſelves with a conſort of Flutes, Cymbals, and other Inſtruments of their Faſhion, and the terrible howlings of the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, which they account Melodious, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as was ſuppoſed by their joy, ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Feaſt. The Beſieged that were in the Counterſcharp, but ten Paces off, could not forbear rallying theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and ask them in ſcorn to give them part in the Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Ball, being they had given them that of their Muſick. And the Ball did truly follow, but the Leapers were on the Chriſtians ſide: For theſe Infidels having ſprung a Mine, which they had newly dug, under the Poſts and Pallizadoes of the Counterſcharp, the Earth, with a good part of the Pallizado, and about ten of the Defendants were blown up, The Turks taking advantage of the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, uſed all their might to render themſelves Maſters of the Counterſcharp, by the breach they had made in it. The Fight was hot, and the Slaughter great. The Confuſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order grew high, but moſt amongſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which being perceived by Count <hi>Serini,</hi> and St. <hi>Croix,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel to <hi>Dupigni,</hi> they ran with a hundred Men to their Aid, and employing them to throw hand Granadoes, and other artificial Fires upon the Enemy, ſo encouraged their Friends, that they fell with revived Courage upon the Enemy, beat them back and kill'd a great number of them, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Heads of the ſlain in rows upon their Pallizadoes, letting theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> know that Chriſtian Walls would not tumble with noiſe of Inſtruments and ſhowting, as the Walls of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico</hi> once did.</p>
                  <p>A Meſſenger being ſent to the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> a ſecond time with Letters in Cyfer, was unhappily taken by the Turk, and his Letters being tyed to an Arrow, were ſhot again into the Town, with Latin lines affixed to them, intimating, that they ſent this Letter to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, being it was to no purpoſe to ſend it to <hi>Lorrain;</hi> being aſſured, that in the ill Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:39539:144"/>the place was in, it would be taken before the Succours could arrive.</p>
                  <p>The Governour publiſhed an Ordinance, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> whereby all Perſons, of what Quality or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſoever they were, being able to bear Arms, and had not yet liſted themſelves in the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Univerſity, or thoſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſhould appear at the New-Market upon the noiſe of the Bells, to be inrolled, and form a fourth Body, which was done; In the mean time, many Chriſtians taken by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> being ſhaved, and in Turkiſh habits, found means to ſave themſelves, and eſcape into the City.</p>
                  <p>The Turks continued their Labours, and the Advancement of their Works; and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Effect of the Bombs which were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thrown out of the City, they covered their Trenches with great Beams and Trees, upon which they threw Sacks of Earth in abundance, which not only cloſed the chinks, but rendred it proof againſt Granadoes, as alſo Musket ſhot. When this Work was finiſhed, not only the principal Baſſaes, but the Viſier himſelf came to view the Trenches, and lodged in them, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their ſeparate Apartments, pav'd with Brick, and divided into Chambers, with all the conveniencies of great Houſes.</p>
                  <p>There arrived an Expreſs in the Camp,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>1.</hi>
                     </note> which informed the Duke, that the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> would not part from <hi>Cracovia</hi> till the <hi>16th</hi> Inſtant; that the Troops of <hi>Saxony</hi> would have their Rendezvous at <hi>Dreſden</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and that thoſe of <hi>Frankonia,</hi> would not begin to march before the <hi>11th:</hi> Theſe Succours appearing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and the duration of the Defence of <hi>Vienna</hi> incertain, his Highneſs reſolved to approach the Enemies Quarters. He thought that he ſhould be able by the Twentieth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> with his Forces, as well <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> as <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and the Troops of <hi>Polanders</hi> which ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Sileſia;</hi> to paſs the <hi>Daunbe</hi> at <hi>Krembs,</hi> and advance with that Body towards the Heights near the Camp of the Enemies, with deſign to maintain himſelf there till the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Allies. During this, he might wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out the Infidels, animate the Beſieged in their Defence, and hold himſelf in a Condition to force a Poſt for the relief of the Place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the neceſſity of Affairs. He ſent Count <hi>Palfi</hi> to Court, to acquaint his Imperial Majeſty with the Deſign, and preſs the march of the Troops, which might be got together by that time; and ſome other diſpoſal of Boats and Proviſions neceſſary for that Expedition.</p>
                  <p>After he had diſpatch'd the Count, he was informed, that Count <hi>Tekely</hi> had ſent Boats to the Turks, that he had paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> and that they were ſeen from <hi>Entſerdorff,</hi> a little Town ſeated upon that River where the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts had ſome Magazins. The Duke marched thither with four Regiments, and thence to the Bridge of <hi>Vienna,</hi> where, having learned that the Enemy had poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of a ſmall Iſland, and that they had taken Boats from the Peaſants, who had retired into the ſaid Iſle, he ordered the Baron of <hi>Mercy</hi> to diſlodge them thence, and returned to <hi>Entſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff. Mercy</hi> cauſed his Cannon to advance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the oppoſite ſhoar to the Iſle, with the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons of <hi>Savoy</hi> which guarded the Bridge, and having broken theſe Boats with his great Shot, he reduced the Turks to an Inability of being able to get out of the <hi>Tabor</hi> or <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Iſle.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Tekely</hi> underſtood that the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts were returned towards <hi>Vienna,</hi> he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned <hi>Moravia</hi> to pay him Contribution. The Duke being advertiſed of it, returned to <hi>Ancren</hi> upon the <hi>Mark,</hi> to defend that Province againſt the <hi>Malecontents.</hi> He was informed upon his arrival there, that a party of them had repaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that River that day, and burnt ſome Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages. He detached preſently 500 <hi>Polanders</hi> to purſue them, ſeconding them with ſome Horſe and Dragoons, who encountering them two Leagues from <hi>Ancren,</hi> loaden with Spoyl, they attack'd them ſo briskly, though far inferior in number, that they killed 500, releaſed the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, recovered all the Booty, and took ten or twelve of their Standards.</p>
                  <p>The Siege was carried on with no leſs brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than it was ſuſtained; and being ſeveral who were out of Employment were neceſſitous, an Ordinance was publiſhed, intimating that Monies and Proviſions ſhould be given to all ſuch who would inroll themſelves, with aſſurance they ſhould not be obliged to ſerve after the Siege. Many accepted of the Condition, received three Patacoons each advance Moneys, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galled with Bread and Wine, by the care of the Prince of <hi>Swartzenberg,</hi> and by the Liberality of the Religious and the Citizens. Wine never failed, nor indeed freſh Meat for the ſick, ſtore of Cattel having been twice brought in by ſally during the Siege. The Magiſtrates had by the Governours Order taxed the Eccleſiaſticks, the Cloyſters, the Citizens, and the Peaſants, who were refuged in the City, to furniſh for the uſe of the Souldiers the hundredth Pint, which was punctually executed, there being none that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay this Impoſition: the greateſt Lords and the Emperours Officers not exempting themſelves upon this Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Steeple, being very obnoxious to the Turks by reaſon of its height, and the great extent of its Diſcoveries, was much ſhot at by them, though <hi>Solyman,</hi> when he beſieged <hi>Vienna,</hi> had declined ruining ſo noble a Fabrick, upon no other Terms, but that they ſhould put a a Half Moon, the Arms of that Empire, upon the Spire of it, which was ſtill up. The Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel that was there the <hi>7th,</hi> perceived betwixt the River <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> Fire and Smoke, which laſted till eight a Clock; <hi>C. Starenberg</hi> judg'd they were <hi>C. Tekely</hi>'s Troops, who in paſſing the <hi>Waagh,</hi> had skirmiſhed with the Imperialiſts, and it proved ſo, as he found by the return of one of his Spyes, which he had ſent to the Duke. The account he gave was, that the Turks having detatched 3000 Horſe to diſcover the Succors which were arrived in the Princes Army, out of <hi>Saxony, Bavaria,</hi> and the Circles, theſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels fell into an Ambuſcade which was laid for them, and where moſt of them were cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that an Aga, Count <hi>Tekely</hi>'s Secretary, and an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Count, ſince dead of his Wounds, were taken Priſoners; that the Imperialiſts had taken a great number of the Enemies Waggons with Baggage, and that ſince this Advantage, many of the chief of the Malecontents were come in to the Duke.</p>
                  <p>Collonel <hi>Heiſter</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Cloſternemburg,</hi> took four hundred of the Enemies Horſe. On the other ſide, the Malecontents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to ſend ſmall parties into <hi>Moravia,</hi> who ſet fire by Night on the Houſes and Villages; and as it was a hard matter to remedy theſe Diſorders by force of Arms, the Duke judged that the beſt way to repreſs them was by that of Reprizals. He cauſed <hi>Tekely</hi> to be advertiſed, that he would ſend Orders to <hi>Zatmar,</hi> and to all the Emperours Garriſons, to burn the Palaces and Houſes of all them of his party. This
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:39539:144"/>threatning put a ſtop to theſe Incendiaries; for he thereupon ſent a Perſon to <hi>Chevalier Labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miski,</hi> under pretext of an Envoy to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to the end he might inform the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> that he had not commanded thoſe burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that they ſhould hear no more of them.</p>
                  <p>About this time, Count <hi>Albret Caprara,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Envoy at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> had Permiſſion given him by the Grand Viſier, to return to his Maſter, and having paſſed by <hi>Tuln,</hi> he had in charge to propoſe to his Imperial Majeſty, that upon the Ceſſion of <hi>Raab</hi> he would aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Siege of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kotlinski,</hi> a Lieutenant, upon promiſe of the firſt vacant Company, had been diſpatched from <hi>Vienna</hi> to the Duke, one from the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Council of State, and the reſt from the County <hi>Caplier</hi> and <hi>Starenberg.</hi> The firſt, for they were of ſeveral dates, marked the danger the Counterſcharp was in, others gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſtate of the Siege, minding him of the Neceſſities of the place, and the Accidents that might happen, and praying him to haſten the Succours, and theſe were writ by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>Caplier</hi>'s Letters particulariz'd the ſlain and wounded, finiſhing with earneſtneſs for Relief, praying him to conſider the Officers, their want of Granados, their ſtock being near ſpent, and the Diſpoſition of the Citizens not to be relied upon. The laſt Letter marked, that <hi>C. Staren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> was ſick of a bloody Flux, and could an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for nothing, unleſs Succours were great and quick.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who was careful in informing the Emperour, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> of all he could learn of the ſtate of the beſieged, failed not to quicken the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to communicate his Intelligence and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to them. He diſpatch'd Count <hi>Caraffa</hi> to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with them, and haſten'd the march of General <hi>Sinariski,</hi> who was come into <hi>Sileſia</hi> ſix days ſince. This Count had alſo in charge, to pray his Majeſty of <hi>Poland</hi> to come with the firſt Troops, as well for the eſteem he had of his Merits, as becauſe he believed that upon the Kings advance the groſs of his Army would follow with more diligence. After he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched <hi>C. Caraffa,</hi> he ſent the Count <hi>Schaffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> to provide Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and Carriages for the Auxiliary Troops by the way as they ſhould paſs. As he did not doubt but that theſe preſſing Letters would quicken th advance of the Troops, he thought he was obliged to provide alſo for the paſſage of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and in order to it reſolved to go to <hi>Krembs,</hi> whereof he advertiſed the Emperour by an Expreſs. About the ſame time <hi>C. Starenberg</hi> had News from his Highneſs of the defeat of <hi>C. Tekely</hi> near <hi>Presburg,</hi> as alſo of the taking of a great Convoy that was going to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, and that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> was upon his march to ſuccour the Place. This good News infuſed Joy into the whole City, and was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed with all the Artillery, and the ringing of all their Bells. As every little Succeſs encourages Souldiers at leaſt to hope, ſo it far'd here. A Scholar having killed a Janizary, and ripped open his Stomach, found ten Duckats in Gold in it; and a Souldier having after a ſtiff Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat diſarmed a Janizary, cut off his Head with his own Sable; Searching him afterwards, he found a Girdle about him full of Moneys, which he hid ſo well that his Comrades did not diſcover it: Being returned into the City, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unſtitch'd his purchaſe, he found an 100 Sequins of Gold. He was ſo tranſported at the ſight with Joy, that he ran like a Mad-man through the Strees, clapping his Hands, and ſhewing his Gold to every body, making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his Extravagancies, that he thought himſelf happier than the Emperour. His good Fortune gave Courage to his Companions, upon hopes of the like Adventure, making them good Anatomiſts and diligent Waiters.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> left <hi>Anneren</hi> encampt at <hi>Volgerdorp.</hi> He there received Letters from the Count <hi>Caplier</hi> and <hi>Starenberg.</hi> The firſt preſſed ſtrongly for Relief, by reaſon of the Diminution of the Garriſon, and the Ammunitions of War. The Style of the ſecond Letter was upon the brave, and ſeemed of a Perſon not greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; but in the three laſt Lines, being in Cypher, he beſought the Duke for ſpeedy Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, becauſe the Retrenchments and cuttings off in the Lebel Baſtion were very ſlight; that his Ammunitions and Officers failed him, and that he every day loſt many of his Men. His Highneſs return'd him anſwers full of comfort, advertiſing him of the ſtate of the advance of the Auxiliaries, and the certitude of his Relief. In order to it, be quits <hi>Volgerdorp,</hi> and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Stokerau,</hi> the better from thence to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Iſles of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and chuſe a place for making a Bridge for his Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Some of the great ones were of Opinion, that <hi>Vienna</hi> ought to be relieved by the Plain, paſſing the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Presburg,</hi> this Opinion found ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny partiſans, their reaſon was that the Army poſting it ſelf above the City, would cut off the Communication of the Beſiegers with thoſe Countries from whence they drew their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions; which being done, they judged the Turks would retire, without the Chriſtians hazarding of a Battel. This reaſoning did not want appearance, if it could be done before the Beſieged were too much preſſed; but the Enemies main force conſiſting in Horſe, that of the Imperialiſts in Foot, the Duke thought Incloſures preferrable to the Plains; beſides, the Allies not being able to meet at <hi>Krembs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Month of <hi>September,</hi> many days would be ſpent in marching thence to <hi>Presburg,</hi> and laying a Bridge over the River there, in a time when the condition of the Siege deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all their haſte. Moreover the Conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Bridge in that place was difficult, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Enemy detached any ſtrong Parties to oppoſe them, as they might eaſily do; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Duke, who had in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Siege looked upon the Mountains of <hi>Kalemberg</hi> as the ſureſt way for the Relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> without any farther amuſing himſelf, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to paſs the Army at <hi>Tuln</hi> and <hi>Krembs,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing all things accordingly for the Execution of this Deſign. He did not believe the Enemy would come thither to oppoſe him, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe part of his Army, and of that of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians</hi> was already on the other ſide of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> and maintained themſelves there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attempts of the <hi>Turks</hi> to diſlodge them; but alſo becauſe it would be dangerous for theſe Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to engage themſelves with a great Body of Horſe beyond the Streights or narrow Paſſages of the Foreſt of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many were the Meſſengers and Spies which paſt betwixt the Duke and Beſieged, his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being careful to encourage and inform them. He now again aſſures them, that the Army compoſed of <hi>Bavarians, Saxons, Poles,</hi> and the Imperial Troops approach'd <hi>Krembs;</hi> That the King of <hi>Poland</hi> Commanded it in Perſon, and that he was accompanied by the Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony;</hi> That the Emperour
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:39539:145"/>was removed from <hi>Paſſaw</hi> to <hi>Lintz,</hi> to be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Vienna,</hi> ſo that now there was nothing more required for the ſaving of Chriſtendom, but a little more reſiſtance, being all the Troops were ready to march. He added, that he himſelf was going to <hi>Krembs,</hi> to prepare the Bridges and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other neceſſary thing, to the end that nothing ſhould retard the Succour of the Place, aſſuring moreover the Governour, that he would expoſe himſelf to all dangers to force the Enemy from the Siege. Fortune did begin now to favour them, being <hi>Tekely</hi> had been defeated at <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> and by the River of <hi>Marcka</hi> with great loſs. This News cauſed a ſenſible Joy in all the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and particularly the Eccleſiaſticks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many were troubled with bloody Fluxes, and very many conſiderable Perſons had been dead of it. The cauſe of this Diſeaſe may well be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the ill Diet, the richeſt ſort being forced to eat ſalt meats, differing from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies of their former feeding, beſides the Meal they made their Bread of was neither clean nor well ground.</p>
                  <p>The Duke in the mean time cauſed ſome Troops of the Regiments of <hi>Grana</hi> and <hi>Baden</hi> to ſecure <hi>Tuln,</hi>

                     </note> where there was a ſtone Wall and a Ditch, for he deſigned to preſerve that Town, and make it one of the heads of his Bridge: the next day he went to diſcover the Ilets of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> and having found them uſeful for his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, he commanded ways to be made in them, and Boats to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>About this time a noiſe was ſpread in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Turks, who inceſſantly mined and moved the Earth, had made a Subterranean paſſage which ſhould open into the Emperours Cellars, by which they pretended to ſurpriſe the Town. The Governour, howbeit he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved nothing of it, ordered the Emperours Guards which were left for the Guard of the Palace, to keep watch and Centinels in the Cellars, which they did with no great regret. The ſame day there happened an accident, which for the rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it may well be recorded. <hi>Kimpler,</hi> an able Engineer, working in a Countermine under the Caſtle-Gate, encountered, deep in the Earth within a walled Vault,<note place="margin">Eſtani.</note> a Coffin of Tin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he thought to have found a dead Corps, but opening it, he was dazzled with the luſtre of a great many pieces of Gold and Silver, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with this Coffin was filled; he ſaw moreover rich Jewels enriched with precious Stones. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſecured this Treaſure, he found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom a Box of Tin, wherein was a Parchment where the following words were traced in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Characters.</p>
                  <p>GAUDEBIS SI INVENERIS, VIDEBIS, TACEBIS, SED ORABIS, PUGNABIS, AEDIFICABIS, NON HODIE, NEC CRAS, SED QUIA UNIVERSUS EQUUS, TURRIS ERECTA ET ARMATA, DIVERSA ORDINATA ARMA SUBSCRIPTIO ROLLANDT HUNN. MOG. POSUIT.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who would divine the Sentiments of <hi>Rowland Hun</hi> of <hi>Mets,</hi> who had depoſited this Treaſure in the Earth, pretended he had ſome Knowledge of the future, and that by this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription he would manifeſt that he knew this Treaſure would be found during the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and that the Infidels ſhould be obliged to abandon it. Their Senſe of the words follows. <hi>Rowland</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>Kimpler,</hi> ſays to him. <hi>Si in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneris,</hi> If thou doſt find what I have hid from all others, <hi>videbis, tacebis,</hi> thou wilt conſider theſe words, and diſcover thy good Fortune to no body, <hi>ſed orabis, pugnabis,</hi> but thou ſhalt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks unto God for reſerving theſe Riches for thee, and, as obliged in gratitude, thou ſhalt fight againſt the Enemies of his Name; <hi>aedifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, non hodie nec cras,</hi> Thou ſhalt imploy the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies I deſigned for thee to build Churches; but it ſhall not be when thy Native Country is deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by War; it ſhall not be neither to day nor tomorrow, <hi>ſed quia univerſus equus,</hi> thou would'ſt ill take thy time whilſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Cavalry ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the Walls of the City; <hi>Turris erecta &amp; armata,</hi> but fear nothing, the Ramparts raiſed for the defence of the City, and the brave Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that Garriſon it, will preſerve it from the vain attempts of the Enemy. <hi>Diverſa ordinata Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> The Arms of the different Nations that thou ſeeſt arrayed in theſe Plains, ſhall only ſerve to render the Victories more glorious, their Triumph more ſplendid, and the flight of the Turks more infamous.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> received new aſſurance by his Spies from the Duke,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>24.</hi>
                     </note> of being relieved in eight days, which cauſed an univerſal Joy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled the Care, and augmented the Courage of all men. On the other ſide, the Infidels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for a general aſſault, whilſt the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the contrary did every day invent new Engines, as <hi>Freize</hi> Horſes bearded with Iron, turn'd Pikes, and the like, to oppoſe in the Breaches. Five hundred Horſe of the Beſiegers paſſing the River, burnt ſome Villages, but they were encountered and defeated by a party of the Imperialiſts, commanded by Collonel <hi>Heiſter,</hi> who cut in pieces the greateſt part of them, the reſt endeavouring to ſave themſelves by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming being drowned in the River.</p>
                  <p>We leſt the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Tuln,</hi> but upon advice that the <hi>Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> were deſigning to make Incurſions into <hi>Moravia,</hi> he detach'd <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> and two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of the Emperours Horſe to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Frontiers of that Province. This Report was grounded upon the Grand Viſiers Order, who upon the Knowledge he had that the Imperialiſts and Auxiliaries took the way of <hi>Tuln</hi> and <hi>Krembs,</hi> had commanded Count <hi>Tekely</hi> to enter into the Hereditary Countries with Fire and Sword, thereby to oblige the Imperialiſts to return back to their defence. But the <hi>Malecontents</hi> having no mind to engage with the Duke, <hi>Tekely</hi> was contented to encamp upon the <hi>Mark;</hi> however, in obedience to the Grand Viſiers Order, he cauſed the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> that were with him to enter into <hi>Auſtria,</hi> having promiſed to follow and ſecond them with his Army.</p>
                  <p>The Duke being advertiſed that the Infidels were burning the Villages towards <hi>Eversdorf,</hi> changed his march, having ſent orders to <hi>Lubo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miski,</hi> who was in the Avant-guard to hault, and inſtead of marching towards <hi>Tuln,</hi> he went to meet the Turks, leaving his Baggage at <hi>Stoka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau</hi> with the Regiment of <hi>Rokondi,</hi> leaving to Count <hi>Leſley</hi> the Care of the Execution of thoſe things which he had reſolved in order to the Paſſage of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the Conjunction of the Auxiliary Forces. The Duke being come to the height of <hi>Piſemberg</hi> about two of the Clock, he could ſee the continuing of the Fires; he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:39539:145"/>thereupon ſent Parties out, who made ſome Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. They were queſtioned, and anſwered, that the preceeding Night they had paſſed the <hi>Marck</hi> with a Body of twenty five thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars;</hi> that <hi>Tekely</hi> followed them, and their Camp was but half a League from the Bridges of <hi>Vienna.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke hereupon immediately command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Baron <hi>Mercy,</hi> with ſome Troops, to the top of the height to diſcover the Enemy. Upon his report he put the Army in Battalia, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his right Wing towards the Wood, under the command of the Counts <hi>Caprara</hi> and <hi>Rabotta,</hi> poſting the Dragoons there, and ſome ſmall Field-pieces; and the left Wing was extended along the Plain under the Conduct of Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden.</hi> He drew the whole into two Lines, and a reſerve, on the right whereof <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomirski</hi>'s <hi>Poles</hi> were placed. The Imperial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was compoſed of thirteen Regiments of Horſe, and five of Dragoons, beſides <hi>Lubomirs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi>'s two thouſand <hi>Poles.</hi> Whilſt the Imperialiſts formed their Squadrons, the Turks likewiſe ranged theirs, leaving the groſs of their Troops in the bottom of the Plain. They began a line upon the heights extending to the left, as if de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to gain the flank of the Imperialiſts. As ſoon as they were approached each other, they began to skirmiſh, and as the Armies grew near, the Infidels detach'd two great Troops, the one of <hi>Turks,</hi> which moved eaſily, and the other of <hi>Tartars,</hi> who advanced towards the left. Some Volleys of Cannon which the Emperours Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons had on their right, did ſomewhat diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Turks whilſt they advanced, but did not hinder them to charge the <hi>Poles</hi> with much firmneſs. They immediately routed two ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and with a ſurpriſing Vigour, or rather Temerity, paſſed even to the ſecond Line, as well by the way they had made, as by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval which the Imperial Horſe had left, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in their Paſſage the fire of all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſquadrons which flank'd them in this charge. Notwithſtanding that, ſome of them penetrated even to the Reſerves, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to return by the ſame way they came, and after the ſame manner, but few of them came off.</p>
                  <p>On the left Wing, the <hi>Tartars</hi> having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by ſmall Troops to gain the flank of the Chriſtians, were not more luckey, for thoſe that paſt were cut in pieces by others that were ſent againſt them, or obliged to return to their main body; after which, the Imperialiſts ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing always in good order to attack the whole front of the Turks, the Enemy ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before they could come up to them. One part took the way towards the <hi>Marck,</hi> and the other towards the Bridges of <hi>Vienna.</hi> They were followed ſome time without being overtaken. Thoſe that took on the <hi>Danube</hi> ſide, finding themſelves purſued, that the <hi>Poles</hi> were not far off, and that the whole Army marched that way, betook themſelves to the only expedient for their eſcape, which was to caſt themſelves into the River, and endeavour a Paſſage by the remaining Poſts and Pillars of the burnt Bridge, leaving their Arms, their Horſes, and their Equipage on the brink of the River; but moſt of theſe were drowned, and the reſt all kill'd or taken. The Night being come on, the Duke camped where he was. On the morrow he was preſented with ſeveral Standards, Timbals, and Drums, and ſome Priſoners of note were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe brought to him. The Turks loſt, as was diſcovered by their own intercepted Letters, from a thouſand to twelve thouſand Men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were killed upon the place, but many were drowned. The Chams Son was hurt, but ſaved himſelf by ſwimming upon his Horſe. The Baſſa of <hi>Erlaw</hi> was ſlain, with many Officers. The next Morning ſome Priſoners were taken, found hid in the Hedges and Buſhes. Their Army conſiſted of near fourteen thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> all Horſe, but that of the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents ſtayed at the <hi>Marck.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Duke came the ſame day to <hi>Cronenberg,</hi> to refreſh his Horſe which had been upon Service twenty four hours, with deſign to go and fight the Malecontents if they continued in their Poſt. He ſent, for this purpoſe, to General <hi>Siemariski,</hi> who was come to <hi>Nekelburg</hi> with a body of Horſe, being the King of <hi>Polands</hi> Avaunt-Guard, to meet him the next day upon the way to <hi>Volgers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorff;</hi> but being upon his March, he had News that the <hi>Tekeliſts</hi> were retired to <hi>Tirnau;</hi> that the King had ſent order to his General to attend him at <hi>Nekelburg,</hi> and that his Majeſty would be at <hi>Krembs</hi> the firſt of <hi>September.</hi> The Duke hereupon returned to his Camp at <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> to expect the arrival of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>They ſeemed in the Town in much diſtreſs, for the Governour had cauſed forty Rockets to be fir'd from the top of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> Steeple, to advertiſe the Duke of the ſtraits they were in, and the neceſſity of being ſuddenly relieved. The Grand Viſier ſeemed to ſcorn theſe ſigns, anſwering them with two hundred Cannon ſhot. And yet it was obſerved, that the Infidels ſent many Camels laden with Baggage and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Servants towards <hi>Presburg,</hi> probably to ſecure them in caſe they ſhould be forced to raiſe the Siege.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day, the Duke ſent the Chevalier <hi>Lubormiski</hi> to compliment the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had alſo orders to inform his Majeſty of the meaſures they had taken for the relief of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna:</hi> and that it ſeemed to require all their haſte, as the Counts <hi>Capliers</hi> and <hi>Starenberg</hi> ſignified by their Letters, the Place being reduced to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but writ in ſuch Terms which made it evident they would defend it with their Lives, but could anſwer for nothing elſe.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Viſier did in the mean time or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Walachians</hi> to endeavour to rebuild the Bridges of <hi>Vienna,</hi> to the end that they might, by a diverſion that way, retard the march of the Imperialiſts, or employ a conſiderable body by that means. As the Waters were grown ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream low ſince the Bridges were ruined, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Pillars which had been then burnt level with the Water, appeared now three or four foot above Water which gave room for this Enterpriſe. They were furniſhed with Timber out of the Neighbouring Villages, and the Work was carried on by the <hi>Walachians</hi> and <hi>Moldavians</hi> with ſo much diligence, that near a third of the great Bridge was laid in two Nights.</p>
                  <p>The Duke having notice hereof, cauſed Boats to be prepared for the retaking of thoſe Poſts which he had quitted in the Iſles. The Count <hi>Archinto</hi> and Collonel <hi>Heyſter</hi> were employed herein, who on the Night of the <hi>31th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> re-entered their old Retrenchments, planting there ſome Pieces of Cannon. Upon break of day they began to play upon the Turks, who were ſo greatly incommoded by the continual firing of great and ſmall ſhot, that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to quit their Enterpriſe. They afterwards applyed Pitch and Tar Barrels to the Pillars that remained, and ſo burnt them. The ſame day the Turks ſent away many Camels, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons loaden with Baggage, and part of their Artillery, which they conducted towards the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:39539:146"/>Foreſt of <hi>Vienna.</hi> After Noon, thoſe who were upon the Ramparts heard ſeveral Musket ſhots the way that theſe Infidels marched, which made them gueſs that they were skirmiſhing with the <hi>Pickeerers</hi> of the Chriſtian Army, and that conſequently the Succors were near hand.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being advertiſed that the King of <hi>Poland</hi> lay at <hi>Heil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi> left the command of the Army to Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> and went to give this Prince a viſit. He met him at the Head of his <hi>Huſſars,</hi> and alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from his Horſe, when he was come within twenty five paces of him, moved towards him, which his Majeſty perceiving, he likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, met him and embraced him, and after ſome obliging diſcourſe, he preſented the Prince his Son to him, ſaying, he would have him to be his Servant, as he was, and that he had brought him with him to teach him betimes to ſerve the Emperour. The Senators, the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and the principal Officers of the Crown, did likewiſe complement the Duke. The King and Duke mounted on Horſeback, and having paſſed the Troops, continued their march, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing the whole time together. When they arrived in the Camp, they entered the Kings Tent, together with the Prince and the Grandees of <hi>Poland,</hi> where the Duke entertained his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with the main Diſcourſes that tended to the Affairs in hand.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Waldeck,</hi> who had no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak with the Duke in the Kings Tent, went to attend him at <hi>Stokarcau,</hi> where he communicated all his Thoughts, and agreed with him of the Manner and Method they were to uſe in relieving the Place.</p>
                  <p>The Duke dined that day with the King, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the upper end on the Right-Hand of the King, the Prince being ſeated on his left, all three in Chairs with backs. Some Palatines and Officers of the Imperial Army were alſo placed at the Table by the Kings Order. After this repaſt the Duke returned to his Camp very well ſatisfied with the Civilities done him by his Majeſty, who likewiſe approved of all what this Prince had propoſed to him, and upon his reite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Inſtances he made to him for haſtening the Conjunction of his Forces, he ſent Orders to his Great General, who was ſtayed behind, to haſten his march. The King himſelf reſolved to be at <hi>Krembs</hi> the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour was to come to agree about the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Paſſage of the Armies.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Emperour, who ſhould have come to <hi>Krembs,</hi> not only to animate and authoriſe the Expedition by his Preſence, but alſo to allay the infinite Difficulties which the Competition of ſo many Princes would occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was retained at <hi>Lintz</hi> by an Indiſpoſition of Health. Thus the Care of all was left to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> as alſo to regulate the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Auxiliary Armies. Having at length found Expedients for all theſe Difficulties, he went and acquainted the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with what he had deſigned, which being highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, he went thence to <hi>Otelſdorff,</hi> where at his intreaty the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals met him. After ſome Conteſtations, the Paſſage of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and the Conjunction of all the Auxiliaries was reſolved upon, which was to be <hi>September</hi> 5. in the Plains of <hi>Tuln.</hi> It was determined that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, with that of the Emperours, ſhould paſs where they were. That the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſhould traverſe the River upon the Bridge at <hi>Krembs,</hi> and whereas the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with ſome <hi>German</hi> Troops camped there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of Count <hi>Leſley,</hi> they ſhould all march in body to <hi>Tuln,</hi> to joyn the Imperial Army, and that of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Princes upon Conſultation deferred the Execution of this Deſign till the ſeventh. The King began to paſs the ſixth, in the Evening. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> after having detached the Contes of <hi>Lodrox, Riccardi</hi> and <hi>Herberwiller,</hi> with their Regiments, and two Batalions of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to joyn 3000 <hi>Poles,</hi> which the King ought to add to them to form a Body to cover <hi>Moravia;</hi> he ſent Collonel <hi>Heyſter</hi> with 600 Horſe to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterneuburg,</hi> with orders to make Fires upon the heights of <hi>Khalenberg,</hi> to advertiſe the beſieged by this ſign, which was concerted betwixt them, of the approach of their relief.</p>
                  <p>The beſieged had been extreamly preſſed, for the Turks had finiſhed their Galleries, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the two Baſtions of <hi>Lebel</hi> and the <hi>Court,</hi> ſo that the beſieged did daily by Meſſages and Rockets advertiſe their Friends of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were reduced to, the Enemy being now attacked to the very body of the place, having made a great breach in the Court Baſtion. The ſixth at Night they were greatly encouraged by the firing of five Fuſees or Rockets upon the Mountain of <hi>Kalenberg,</hi> which made them judge their help near hand, and which they anſwered by the like Signal.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Viſier, not ignorant of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians motion, on the ſeventh commanded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of his Troops to be made, which upon enquiry were repreſented to him by his Officers to amount to 168000 Men; a Liſt whereof was found in his Tent, as alſo in that of <hi>Reiz Effendi,</hi> or chief Secretary, the which we have omitted here, not to puzzle the courſe of Hiſtory with hard Names: but ſhall however, to ſatisfie the more curious, ſubjoyn not only that, but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account of the Chriſtian Army that raiſed this celebrious Siege, and alſo of thoſe Worthies who deſerve to have their Memories transferred to Poſterity, for defending their City with ſo ſignal Bravery and Conſtancy.</p>
                  <p>It did not ſeem that the Chriſtian Princes in the Turkiſh Army did ſerve them with any great good will. <hi>Tekely,</hi> who had been but once in the Camp to ſalute the Grand Viſier, left but a thouſand <hi>Hungarians</hi> with him upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; and <hi>Abaſſi,</hi> though often invited to the Port, excuſed his attendance by manifold Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. However the Viſier being entred <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> he could not diſpenſe with his waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at <hi>Javarin,</hi> though but with few Troops. He was notwithſtanding well received by this Miniſter, and ſent back to guard the Paſſages betwixt <hi>Raab</hi> and <hi>Ramnitz,</hi> and the Bridges which the Turks had built upon thoſe two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, to ſecure a retreat in caſe Fortune proved their Enemy. The Vayvod of <hi>Walachia,</hi> already mentioned, cauſed a Croſs of Oak of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bigneſs to be planted before his Tent in the Camp at <hi>Vienna;</hi> it is ſeventeen foot in length, with this Inſcription in Latin upon it;</p>

                  <p>The Infidels, upon the approach of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, were in no little diſorder, their whole Camp being in a tumultuous Motion, their Horſe mov'd confuſedly, and the Servants were ſeen to load their Camels with Baggage, which made the Beſieged judge, that they deſign'd to march to meet the Succours; notwithſtanding this Diſorder, they did not diſcontinue their Approaches, and the following day redoubled the firing of their Cannon and Mortars. That Morning, a Priſoner being taken, reported, That the Turks were in a great Conſternation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Chriſtians were already upon the Mountain of <hi>Kalemberg.</hi> Thoſe who were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rampart ſaw their Enemies pull down their Tents, and go and joyn their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who were advanced to oppoſe the Paſſage of the Chriſtians, and about Noon they ſaw a great Body ranging themſelves in Battalia at the foot of the Mountain, whilſt others joyned them, carrying with them all their Baggage and Proviſions upon Waggons and Camels, as if they deſigned to change their Camp, where they alſo planted their Pavilions in the ſame manner, as if they intended a long ſtay there, probably to refreſh themſelves, to be more brisk, and in a condition to fight the Succours when they ſhould deſcend from the Hills. During all theſe motions, the attack was carried on with redoubled vigour, and though the defence was yet braver, yet at Night they fired many Rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets to advertiſe their friends that the place was reduced to the laſt extremity, and that they could hold out no longer.</p>
                  <p>But now the Chriſtians were ſeen to cover the Mountain of <hi>Kalemberg,</hi> and to ſalute their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with ſeveral volleys of Cannon. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend well the joy of the beſieged at ſo char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a ſpectacle, we need but repreſent to our ſelves, how they had been cloſe ſhut up the ſpace of nine Weeks, being every hour, indeed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in cruel apprehenſions for their goods, their lives, their Wives and their Children; and to ſee themſelves now upon the point to be delivered from theſe terrible alarms.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Army being aſſembled, as is already ſaid, at <hi>Tuln,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> had put an end to ſeveral difficulties which were again ſtarted about the Rank, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of ſo many Princes and Generals, he brought it to a concluſion, that they ſhould march the next day, being the <hi>9th,</hi> towards <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</hi> As ſoon as this reſolution was taken, he ſent Baron <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>Morbach</hi> with 2000 Horſe, to obſerve the countenance and motions of the Turks. The <hi>9th,</hi> at the point of day, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the <hi>German</hi> Army, and came and encamped betwixt St. <hi>Andrew</hi> and <hi>Koningſeck.</hi> In this Poſt he received advice of the Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to its laſt extremity, and that they fired with nothing but Muskets. He ſent to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who was yet at <hi>Tuln,</hi> with the news, and cauſed the Priſoners to be conducted to him, who confirmed the advice. He writ alſo to him, beſeeching him to advance and joyn with him.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>10th,</hi> the Duke cauſed the <hi>Germans</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mountains by three ſeveral avenues, and left a fourth for the March of the <hi>Poles.</hi> He camped at <hi>Wilbleng,</hi> and the <hi>Poles</hi> reſted an hour behind to the right. The King himſelf came to diſcover the heights where the Imperialiſts were camped. The Duke ſhewed him <hi>Kalem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> from thence, whither he would march next morning; and his Majeſty returned to his Camp. By favour of the night the Duke went in Perſon to diſcover the paſſage of <hi>Kalemberg,</hi> and to take poſſeſſion of thoſe Poſts he judged neceſſary to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their march. He alſo ſeiſed the Chappel of St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> and having put 300 men into it to ſecure it, returned to his Camp, having ſent to inform the King of what was done; after this the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was put in Battel-array to poſſeſs <hi>Kalemberg</hi> by five differing ways, according to the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given by the Duke, and conſented to by the King. The way on the right was left to his Majeſty, as the day before.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Sax-Lawenburg,</hi> General of the Horſe, took the next paſſage to the <hi>Poles,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting by that way the Right Wing, conſiſting of eight Regiments of the Emperour's Horſe, two of Dragoons, and one of Crauats, of all the Horſe and all the Dragoons of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Francony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Infantry of <hi>Franconia</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> took the third way, which was the middle-moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commanded by the Prince of <hi>Waldeck.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> placed himſelf with the ſaid Prince that day, and continued there all the day following, advancing with much firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in places of moſt danger, but without any Fonction or command, he having declared at firſt, that he would only ſerve as a Voluntier.</p>
                  <p>All the Emperour's Infantry, and that of <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> took the other two paſſages to the left, whereof one was that of St. <hi>Leopold</hi>'s Chappel, being the high-way, and the other went along the <hi>Danube.</hi> Prince <hi>Herman</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> and Count <hi>Leſley</hi> General of the Artillery were at the head of the Foot. Count 4<hi>Caprara</hi> General of the Horſe followed immediately by the ſame ways with the left Wing, which contained ſeven Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Emperour's, <hi>Lubomirski's Poles,</hi> to which the King had joyned ſome Squadrons of his, and all the Cavalry and Dragoons of <hi>Saxony.</hi> The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> commanded the Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Troops, which, however of differing tempers and Bodies, marched in Battalia, in as much as the ground would permit it, and were compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to amount to 65000 men. About eleven of the clock, the firſt Squadrons had gained the tops of <hi>Kalemberg,</hi> without any oppoſition at all. They there extended the Front of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my above a league and a half, camping on the declivity of the Mountain towards <hi>Cloſternew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> in three lines, and ſome places more, as the ground would permit them, ſeizing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſeven or eight Avenues, by which they might deſcend and range themſelves for the combat.</p>
                  <p>They brought at the ſame time ſome ſmall Field-Pieces to St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> and to the Monaſtery of <hi>Camaldoli.</hi> The remainder alſo of the day and all the night was ſpent in advancing the Train, which was not effected without great trouble, the Mountain being ſo ſteep, that none but ſmall Field-Pieces could be brought up, nor they but in ſome time doubling and tripling the draught Horſes.</p>
                  <p>The Turks ſeeing the Chriſtians appear about the Chappel of St. <hi>Leopold,</hi> and the aforeſaid Monaſtery, drew out on their right, advanced to the foot of the Mountains and extending thence to the brink of the <hi>Danube,</hi> they ſeized the Hedges, hollow-ways and heights, from whence they might incommode the Enemy at the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the hills and firſt filings out of their ſtreights.</p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:39539:147"/>
                  <p>The Cannon being arrived at St. <hi>Leopold</hi> and <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> they-quickly obliged the Turks to quit the Poſts which they had taken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of their ſhot. The Troops which they had advanced, conſiſted in Horſe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort of Militia, which fights like our Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons on Horſe-back and on foot. Of theſe the number was great, and they had brought but few Foot out of the Camp, and without Cannon in all this detachment which they oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>The ſpace betwixt <hi>Vienna</hi> and the entry of the Wood is reckoned a League and a half, the Country being very difficult, trenched with Vineyards, Ravines and hollow ways. The Vineyard was encloſed by a great Dike which covered the Turks Camp on the ſide of <hi>Helgſtat.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had choſen this march, to make uſe of the advantage of the heights, and judging that in a ſituation of this nature, he might ſecure his Flanks. His deſign was the next day to coaſt the <hi>Danube,</hi> and to attack the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Camp on their right. It was for this reaſon, and becauſe of the cuts in the ground, that he placed a great Body of Foot to the left, this Wing being deſigned firſt to charge the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who ſtay'd an hour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, having encamped, came to St. <hi>Leopolds</hi> Chappel, from whence the Duke ſhewed him the deſcent of the Mountain, the Camp of the Turks, and the Troops which were advanced to oppoſe the deſcent of the Chriſtians. Their Countenance made his Majeſty of opinion, that they would diſpute all the paſſages, and that the Duke ſhould do well if they could the next day ſeize the firſt heights at the entry of the Wood. He moreover deſired ſome <hi>German</hi> Foot to joyn with his in the deſcent of the Mountain. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained four Battalions, he cauſed them to advance on that ſide, whereby the <hi>Poles</hi> were to deſcend. Towards the evening of that day, the Duke having ſurveyed the ground at the foot of <hi>Camaldoli,</hi> ordered Count <hi>Leſley</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome Troops to take poſt at night at the going out of the Wood, and to raiſe a Battery there, the better to ſecure the paſſage of the Army the next day. At firſt there were but two Battalions ſent Count <hi>Leſley,</hi> deferring to ſend any greater number till it was with the Artillery. They laboured all Night at this work; but the Turks being aware of it, before it was finiſhed, they ſent ſome Troops very early to hinder the Labourers, and poſted themſelves neat them behind a Curtain, and behind Planks which well-nigh ſhut the deſcent from the Mountain before the Chriſtians Battery. Count <hi>Fontaine,</hi> who commanded the Poſt, was quick in oppoſing their effort, and having called the men from their work, and got his two Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together, he poſted them betwixt his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and their Barricado, yet ſo as not to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by them, who at the ſame time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſtretch to the right and left, to gain the Chriſtians Flanks.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who obſerved from St. <hi>Leopolds</hi> Chappel the Turks motion, ſent ſome Battalions of the Regiments next hand to the relief of his men. Theſe being commanded by the Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> arriving in time, the Imperialiſts exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their line, and took a reſolution to attack the Infidels in their Poſt behind their blind. This was executed with ſo much vigour, that the Enemy were forced to give way. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned their Poſt, and retired to another, where the groſs of their Body remained. The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> having his ſhoulder pierced with a Musket-ſhot in this action, was obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, leaving the command to <hi>C. Fontaine,</hi> who diſpoſed all things for the defence of the Poſt, which the Enemy ſeemed forward to attack a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but they contented themſelves with ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of their own ſtation, the fire continuing brisk on both ſides.</p>
                  <p>The Duke perceiving that the Turks made all that Body move which had camped beyond <hi>Neudorff</hi> to ſupport their advanced Troops, he firſt commanded all the left Wing to march, and preſently after he gave order to Prince <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi> and to the Duke of <hi>Sax-Lawenburg,</hi> to ruſh out of the Woods upon the Enemies, who were at the head of their Camp. He ſent to advertiſe the King of <hi>Poland</hi> of all this, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Majeſty came to St. <hi>Leopolds</hi> Chappel, he went to meet him there, and ſhewing the motions the Armies were in, he acquainted him with all the orders that he had given upon this occaſion. After they had agreed upon all things, the King having performed his devotion at the Chappel, mounting on Horſe-back, he went from Rank to Rank, exhorting his Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to do well, and ſpake to them after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Generous Poliſh Cavaliers, <hi>It is not only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the glory which your Anceſtors, and your courage have acquired to you, of being eſteemed the invincible Bulwark of Chriſtendom againſt the</hi> Ottoman <hi>Power, It is not the defence only of your own Country, which the loſs of</hi> Vienna <hi>by an infallible conſequence will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to the cruel Invaſion of thoſe againſt whom you are going to fight; but it is the cauſe of God, and to ſave the Empire of the West which does us the honour to have recourſe to our Arms; an honour which our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors did never preſume to hope for, and which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for your valour. Think then of nothing but conquering, or to dye nobly in this occaſion, to which the glory of Martyrdom is concomitant. Think that your King fights in the head of you, to partake with you of your perils and your victories, and rest aſſured that the God of Battels, whoſe cauſe we are going to defend, will not fail to fight for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt this Prince endeavoured by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſes to inſpire his Troops with that generous ardour he was himſelf agitated; the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who had been advertiſed of the approach of their relief, ſaw with inexpreſſible content, the Army of the Chriſtians deſcend from the Mountains of <hi>Kalemberg,</hi> being aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the noiſe of the Cannon which was ſhot againſt the Turks, who had parapetted the Paſſages with earth and ſtone, though to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that their deliverance was near. And they would alſo contribute all they could to it, by the diſcharge of all their Artillery from the Baſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Curtains of the wall. There was alſo an infinity of ſmall ſhot diſcharged on both ſides, with many Granadoes. The Turks had not as yet ſhot ſo many Bombs ſince the beginning of the Siege, as they did this day, to retard the Chriſtians that deſcended into the Plain, and to annoy thoſe who crowded upon the heights of the City, to obſerve the deſcent of their friends and the combat.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt the King of <hi>Poland</hi> continued his march at the head of his Army, the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> cauſed <hi>Heisters</hi> Regiment of Dragoons, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which Count <hi>Caprara</hi> poſts to the left at the foot of St. <hi>Leopolds</hi> Chappel, to deſcend. That of <hi>Heister</hi> received orders at eight of the clock to go and attack the Enemies, who had poſſeſſed a place to the left, from whence they troubled the Imperialiſts, and the Infantry had likewiſe order to advance upon the Turks, who were retired behind their courtains
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:39539:147"/>and hollow ways. This motion was made on both ſides at once. The Turks made ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance at firſt, but not with Vigour enough to hinder the Chriſtians advance, who obliged them to retire behind another blind.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Leſley,</hi> who had brought down ſome Cannon, planted it at the head of the Infantry. The Duke of <hi>Croy</hi> was alſo returned, for having uſed the firſt Applications to his hurt, he had force enough not to quit the fight the whole day. This advantage gave both time and room to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the front of the left Wing, as it deſcended and iſſued out of the Streights. In the mean time, the firſt Line of Infantry, which in their march againſt the Infidels gave continual fire with their Muſquets, mingled with that of Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, beat them out of another Poſt, and a Line of Curtain which reach'd from the <hi>Danube</hi> Hill over againſt the <hi>Carthuſians.</hi> The Duke about ten a Clock made a halt, and whilſt the reſt of the left Wing filled the ground which the firſt Troops had taken, and that Count <hi>Caprara</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to the Banks of the <hi>Danube;</hi> he ſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the Prince of <hi>Waldeck,</hi> who began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon th firſt heights to the right, and to the Duke of <hi>Saxon-Lawenburg,</hi> who was alſo got out of the Wood, to continue their march until they were equal with the front of the Troops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> and to advance extending to the right, until they came within ſhot of the <hi>Poles,</hi> upon their iſſuing out of their Avenues which were on the right hand of all.</p>
                  <p>Theſe orders being given, the Duke returned to the head of the left Wing, to make the great Body of the <hi>Germans</hi> move at once. The Great Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> came and joyned him, and continued always near him in the places the moſt expoſed. At Noon they ſaw the King at the Head of his Troops, who came and joyned the right Wing of the Imperialiſts. The Duke in the mean time took care that in marching to the Enemy, the Subaltern Generals ſhould rally and re-eſtabliſh any Diſorders which might have happened by the Difficulty of the Paſſages, and that all ſhould advance with equality, firing continually with their great and ſmall ſhot.</p>
                  <p>The march was in this order, though ſlowly, by reaſon of the roughneſs of the way, and the oppoſition of the Enemy, the left moving along the <hi>Danube</hi> as far as the Village of <hi>Neudorff,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed it, after a conſiderable reſiſtance. To the right, upon the ſame Line, there was another Hill guarded by the Turks, at the attack where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a Dutch Batallion being diſordered, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by <hi>Stirums</hi> Dragoons, ordered by Count <hi>Dunewald.</hi> This Batallion recovered, took the Poſt, and continued to advance.</p>
                  <p>The juſtneſs of this march, the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies order of Battel, and the ſcituation of the Place, which made the Imperialiſts appear as in a kind of Amphitheater, preſented a great and formidable object to the ſight, which aſtoniſhed the Turks, and did not a little contribute to the Victory.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> being yet behind, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my halted near <hi>Newdorff,</hi> until he was advanced upon the ſame Line, after which they continued their march. The Imperialiſts carried, without very great reſiſtance, the Poſt the Turks had at <hi>Helgſtat,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Waldeck</hi> obliged thoſe that oppoſed him to retire.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Infidels, who were in Battalia in their Camp, moved as if they had deſigned upon the left Wing, but perceiving the Army of <hi>Poland</hi> upon the heights, they mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that way, ſo that the <hi>Poles</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> faced each other almoſt in the ſame order, making more depth then front. The <hi>Poles</hi> ſeemed back'd by the Wood, and the <hi>Turks</hi> by their Camp.</p>
                  <p>The King, who was in the head of his Troops, detach'd ſome ſquadrons of his <hi>Huſſars,</hi> who charged the Turks, being all Lanciers, with great Vigour they bore before them thoſe that oppoſed them; but engaging themſelves too far, they drew ſo many Enemies upon them, that they were forced to run. The Turks followed them to a Place where Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely poſted two Batalions of <hi>Bavarians.</hi> The fire of theſe Foot cooled the purſuit of the Enemy, and gave the King of <hi>Poland</hi> time to cauſe his firſt Line to advance to re-eſtabliſh the Diſorder of his <hi>Huſſars.</hi> Count <hi>Rabata,</hi> at the Kings deſire, joyned the Emperours Dragoons with them. But this body of Turks detach'd from their Troops, did not dare to ſtand the ſhock of the Chriſtians, but retired to a height where they had Foot and Cannon, with more diligence then they were come.</p>
                  <p>After this advantage, the King continued to march with all his Army, and the Turks en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to obſtruct their Paſſage from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Poſts they had. The fire of their Artillery and Muſquets did ſome harm to the <hi>Poles,</hi> but did not break them, and ſo they advanced ſtill gaining Ground inſenſibly upon the Enemy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Duke being far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards the left of the Enemies Camp, to divert their Endeavours upon the right, the Turks put themſelves in battalia upon the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or — before their Camp, and planting ſome great Guns againſt the Chriſtians, they made many ſhot, and ſeemed by their meen to reſolve to defend that Poſt which was the ſtrongeſt of all, and ſerved for a Retrenchment for their Camp, but their firmneſs did not laſt long. The Imperialiſts being advanced within Muſquet ſhot, they abandoned their Station about five in th Evening, and left them the convenience of paſſing it without diſorder, and entring into their Camp.</p>
                  <p>It was then that the Duke, making uſe of this Advantage, wheeled all his left Wing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of continuing his way by the <hi>Danube,</hi> he cauſed it to march to the right, to enter into the Enemies Camp, no Souldier quitting his rank to pillage their Baggage which they had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and their Tents ſtanding. This motion being perceived by the Turks who were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the <hi>Poles</hi> on the right Wing, quite diſmayed them, and they began to retire for fear of being charged in the Flank. The King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon paſſed the Ravine with his Troops, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the firing of ſome Janizaries that defended it, and purſued the Enemies. About ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Clock he entred their Camp ſome little time after Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> who paſſed into it with his <hi>Bavarians</hi> and <hi>Franconians.</hi> Half an hour after, the Duke having gained the Suburbs and Counterſcharp, commanded Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> to advance towards the Trenches of the Turks with ſome Troops that the Baron of <hi>Mercy</hi> conducted, but this Prince could not come there ſo ſoon, but that the Janizaries that were in guard there had leiſure to make their retreat by favour of the Night that came on. They had begun it as ſoon as they ſaw the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians approach their Camp. They retired with no great loſs, having had the bravery before they abandoned their Trenches to attempt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attack againſt the City, and to turn and fire the Cannon of their Batteries againſt the Army. The Night ſuſpended the Victory, and obliged the Troops to make halt in that part of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:39539:148"/>the Camp which was betwixt the <hi>Danube</hi> and the City, the Turks being retreated on the other ſide of the River.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> ſent to complement the King, upon the happy ſucceſs of that day, which was owing to his preſence. This Prince returned his complement, confeſſing that every body had a ſhare in it, but that all the honour was due to his Conduct, and to the valour of the <hi>German</hi> Troops, who firſt entred the Camp, and the Enemies works.</p>
                  <p>During the Night the Turks paſſed the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at <hi>Schunket,</hi> making their retreat by the Rear of their Front, and quitted their Camp with ſo much precipitation, that they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them in the great Viſier's Quarters the Standard of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, and the Horſe Tayle, the ordinary Enſigns of their dignity. They left alſo all their Tents, and the greateſt part of their Equipage, all their Ammunition and Proviſions, which they had in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, all their Artillery, amounting to 180 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, and they haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their retreat with ſo much diligence, that their formoſt Troops had the next day paſſed the <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians loſt no body of conſideration except Prince <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Croy,</hi> the Count of <hi>Tranſmandorff,</hi> young <hi>Poloski</hi> Captain of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Huſſars;</hi> and the wounded, beſides the Duke of <hi>Croy,</hi> the Counts <hi>Fontaine, Tilly,</hi> and <hi>Schalemburg,</hi> were inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>13th</hi> early, the Duke having appointed his Army to be ready, went to wait on the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to regulate their march, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate purſuit of the Victory. But finding him little diſpoſed to it, he omitted no inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to perſwade him to it, propoſing to him to march with all the Army, or with all the Horſe only, or elſe with a great detachment; but the King oppoſed the wearineſs of his Troops, and the neceſſity of refreſhing them ſome hours. The King thereunto being unwilling, the Duke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the City.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Viſier, before his flight, cauſed the Heads of five of the Women of his Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio to be cut off, for fear they ſhould fall into the hands of the Conquerors. The Baron of <hi>Kaunitz,</hi> the Emperors Reſident at the Port, who was at preſent in the Viſier's Quarters, was in danger of being killed by the Chriſtians in the heat of the Battel, as being habited after the Turkiſh faſhion. By day there was not a Turk left, though they were traced during the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Night by the Villages on fire, the Infidels having marked their retreat with this laſt cruelty, after they had firſt burnt their Camp, as far as the precipitation of their flight, and the fear which obliged them to be gone would permit them. They retired alſo out of the Iſle by favour of their lower Bridge, the upper Bridge which they had layed being poſſeſſed by the Chriſtians upon their arrival. The ſame evening many Cavaliers and Souldiers entered the City with great Droves of Cattel, which they found in the Camp and near it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the following days, Beef became ſo cheap that they were ſold for five and ſix Florins each.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being now aſſured that he had no more Enemies to combat, diſpatcht the Count of <hi>Aversberg,</hi> Son to the Prince of that name, to the Emperor, to inform him with the happy ſucceſs of that day.</p>
                  <p>On the morrow of the fight, being the <hi>13th,</hi> the fire took in the Powder which the Turks had left a League from the City, and confumed an infinite number of Bombs, Granadoes, and other artificial fire-works. This accident was attributed to the negligence of ſome Chriſtian Souldiers, and yet there were prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of Powder, Bullets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> left behind. It was obſervable that many of the Cannon which the Turks had abandoned were marked with the Arms of the Emperours <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the firſt, and <hi>Rodolf</hi> the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>After the Souldiery had pillaged the immenſe Riches of the Camp, which amounted to many Millions, the King of <hi>Poland</hi> entered into the City, accompanied with Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> the Governour, many Commanders, and a great number of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, where <hi>Te Deum</hi> being ſung, he, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and ſeveral Grandees, were ſumptuouſly treated by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, the People by their joyful acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons eechoing the praiſes of their Deliverers.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> was employed in giving the neceſſary Orders for the Army, part of it beginning to diſcamp, and all together with the <hi>Poles,</hi> deſigning to go in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the Enemy, which favourable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was omitted in expectation of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who alſo arrived that evening at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he was received coming out of his Boat, by the two Electors, and the principal Officers of War and Juſtice. Having taken a view of the Enemies works, He cauſed <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung with all the ſolemnity poſſible in the Church of St. <hi>Stephen.</hi> That done, he cauſed the Creſcent and Star, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Arms, to be taken down from the Spire of that Steeple, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there ſince the time of <hi>Solyman,</hi> being theſe laſt Turks did not ceaſe ſhooting at it, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Croſs in their place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wedneſday</hi> being the <hi>15th,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent his Grand Chancellor to the Emperor with a numerous Train to complement him, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him a part of the booty which he had found in the Grand Viſier's Tent, and amongſt other things, the Standard which was always carried before him when he marched. It was made of Horſe-hair work'd with the Needle, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with flowers, the ſtaff of it was guilt, as alſo the Apple which was of braſs. They call it <hi>Tugh</hi> in their Language, which is to ſay <hi>Horſe Tayle.</hi> The Chancellor made a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Latin Speech, and the Emperour anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with Sentiments of eſteem and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment for his Majeſty of <hi>Poland.</hi> After a quarter of an hours converſation with this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, and hearing Maſs in our Lady of <hi>Loretto</hi>'s Chappel, he took Horſe to ride to the Camp, where he was to viſit the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> There was ſome difficulty about the upper hand. This Prince pretended it, and there were examples contrary to this pretenſion. In the mean time what he had done deſerved particular conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. To conclude, it was reſolved, for the removing of theſe obſtacles, that the Emperor ſhould go ſee the Troops, that they ſhould be ranged in Battalia, and that theſe two Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns ſhould advance within twenty ſteps of each other, which was performed in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner following. The Emperour, having ſeen the <hi>Bavarians</hi> in Battalia, continued his way to <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersdorff,</hi> where the firſt Squadrons of the left Wing were drawn up, and thence he went to <hi>Swech</hi> where the right Wing was poſted, and where the King of <hi>Poland</hi> expected him. Being within Piſtol-ſhot of each other, the King, with the Prince his Son, upon a little gallop moved forwards, and then both Princes uncovered at once, ſaluted and covered again in a moment. The Emperor ſpoke firſt, and told the King,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:39539:148"/>
                     <hi>That he was extremely obliged to him, for leaving his Country, and undertaking a long and painful voyage, to come and combat his Enemies and deliver</hi> Vienna; <hi>that all Chriſtendom ſhar'd in the obligation, and that he had covered himſelf with glory by ſo generous an action.</hi> The King of <hi>Poland</hi> anſwered him, <hi>that it was to God alone that we ought to render our thanks for this Victory; that he had done nothing but what every Christian Prince was obliged to do upon the like occaſion; and that he would endeavour for the future to do yet more for the Interest of Religion, that all his diſpleaſure was, that he was not in a condition to purſue the Enemy upon their defeat, but that his Troops after a march of three days required ſome reſt, eſpecially his Cavalry, the Horſe being extremely tired.</hi> Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> who by order of his Father was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed that day after the <hi>German</hi> faſhion, kiſſed the Emperour's hand, who thereupon returned into the City, and the King further into his Camp. His Imperial Majeſty in his return obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that all the Villages and Palaces were burnt around, except the place where <hi>Solyman</hi> had formerly camped, when he beſieg'd <hi>Vienna;</hi> in memory whereof the Emperour <hi>Rodolf</hi> had cauſed a houſe of pleaſure to be built in that place, with Towers, which were covered with guilt Copper in the ſame ſymmetry or figure that the Sultans Tents were; ſo that the Turks being informed that this building had been made after the Model of <hi>Solymans</hi> Camp, would not ruine it during the Siege, but had made a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazin of it, where was alſo found a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bread and Biſquet.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour employed the reſt of the time that he ſtayed at <hi>Vienna,</hi> in viſiting the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Fortifications with Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> had made behind the Baſtions and the Walls, to defend the Ground foot by foot. The Prince Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> parted the fifteenth with all his Troops. His retreat ſeemed precipitated, and ſuppoſed to be upon account of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants of <hi>Hungary,</hi> thinking perhaps he had done enough in ſaving of <hi>Vienna,</hi> whereto he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly contributed. The Emperour, willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence Count <hi>Starenberg</hi>'s Services, made him Marſhal General of the Field, and of his Privy Council; he gave him 100000 Florins, and writ to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſend him the Order of the <hi>Golden Fleece.</hi> He alſo conferred the ſame Employments, and Honours upon Count <hi>Capliers,</hi> and having preſented Prince <hi>Alexander,</hi> the King of <hi>Polands</hi> Son, with a Sword richly adorned with Jewels of great value, He returned back to <hi>Lintz.</hi> The greateſt part of thoſe who fled upon the approach of the Turks, returned to the City when they knew the Siege was raiſed. They began to rebuild the Houſes that were ruined, and amongſt others the Emperours Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace and <hi>Scots</hi> Church,</p>
                  <p>During theſe Triumphs at <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Grand Viſier, ſenſible of his misfortune, and the malice of his Enemies, and knowing that the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> would render him no good Offices at Court, upon the raiſing of the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> reſolved to prevent him, and informed the Grand Seignior, by an expreſs he diſpatch'd to him to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> that he had diſpoſed all things to check the firſt onſet of the Chriſtians, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them in Battel, which would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been accompanied with Succeſs; but that he was forced to change deſign, becauſe the Baſſa retired with his Army, the <hi>Walachians,</hi> the <hi>Moldavians,</hi> and the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> which did ſo mainly abate the Courage of his Troops, that it was afterward impoſſible for him to bring them to fight; that ſo he had been obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to conſerve the reſt of the Army, and not to hazard the Perſon of his Highneſs. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Grand Viſier, having well examined the Conſequences which the ill Succeſs of his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe might have, did ſcarce believe himſelf ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by this precaution, and he perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he muſt immolate the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi>'s Life to preſerve his own. He cauſed him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be arreſted, together with the Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaes of <hi>Erſeck</hi> and <hi>Poſlega,</hi> who he knew were of Intelligence with the former, and cauſed them all three to be ſtrangled. Theſe proceedings furniſhed his Enemies with Pretexts to deſtroy him, chiefly the <hi>Kiſler-Agaſi,</hi> a Creature of the Sultana <hi>Valide,</hi> to whom ſhe had recommended upon her Death-bed, to revenge her upon this chief Miniſter, which he alſo did.</p>
                  <p>After the Death of theſe three Baſſaes, the Grand Viſier continued his march, but in his Paſſage by <hi>Raab,</hi> that Garriſon fell upon his Rear-Guard, and kill'd near 600 of them. At <hi>Gran</hi> he was joyned by a body of 15000 Turks, who were going to <hi>Belgrade.</hi> The remains of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army were diſperſed ſome at <hi>Gran,</hi> ſome at <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> at <hi>Buda</hi> ſome, and the reſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched near <hi>Altemburg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Chriſtians diſcourſed of the reſt of the Campania; but as part of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies did think they had done enough in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the relief of <hi>Vienna,</hi> thought of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home, many Councils were held to examine by what means they might be ſtayed. The Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> continued inflexible in his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, adn was marched for his Country. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> conſented to leave his Troops with the Emperours, but the Prince of <hi>Waldeck</hi> gave them to underſtand, that he ſhould want new orders for the undertaking of new Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes with the Troops of <hi>Franconia,</hi> which he commanded. But the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himſelf that theſe Difficulties had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned if by a quick engagement they had hurried the Allies to purſue the Victory, and this was one of the chief reaſons that moved the Duke to preſs the King in it.</p>
                  <p>Several Projects were made to divide the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for different Occaſions, many Conferences were had with the Allyes, and all the time was conſumed in Councils. In the mean time, the Duke, who thought of nothing but improving the reſt of the Summer, propoſed every thing that he thought favourable, either for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Hungary,</hi> for the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> or that of <hi>Gran,</hi> or to take the Poſts of <hi>Barcam,</hi> and that of <hi>Peſt</hi> for the ſetling of their Winter Quarters, and made it appear that nothing of all this could be done without great Forces, the Army of the Turks not being wholly deſeated, however routed, and that the Rebels Army was ſtill entire.</p>
                  <p>He determined nothing, becauſe he knew not what meaſures the Turk would take. He only affirmed, that they ought to march forthwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hungary</hi> with all the Diſpoſitions neceſſary to act as the Enemies ſhould direct.</p>
                  <p>The Emperour having approved his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and the King of <hi>Poland</hi> conforming to them, they marched the <hi>18th</hi> towards <hi>Presburg,</hi> and they encamped the ſame day with all the Imperial Troops near <hi>Fichen;</hi> from thence they went to <hi>Heinburg,</hi> and the <hi>20th</hi> they approached <hi>Presburg,</hi> where the Duke expected the Boats from the Bridge of <hi>Tuln</hi> according to orders. However the Bridge could not be finiſhed till the <hi>25th,</hi> by reaſon of the great Winds, and the Difficulty of getting Boats in a deſolate Country. The <hi>Franconians</hi> continued camped near <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the <hi>Bavarians</hi> came the <hi>19th</hi> to <hi>Fichen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:39539:149"/>
                  <p>The <hi>22th,</hi> news came that Count <hi>Budiani,</hi> who upon the arrival of the Turks had abandoned the paſſages which he kept upon the <hi>Raab,</hi> and embraced the party of the Malecontents, after having warred againſt the Emperour's Troops with a Body of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, burnt and pillaged a great number of Villages upon the frontier of <hi>Styria,</hi> had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed and cut in pieces thoſe ſame Turks to which he was united, and had afterwards joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Count of <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> to endeavour to incommode them of the great Army in their retreat towards <hi>Buda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bridge upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> to paſs into the Iſle of <hi>Schuts,</hi> being finiſhed the <hi>25th,</hi> the <hi>Poles</hi> began to file over the ſame day, and being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the Emperour's Army, they encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the <hi>27th</hi> at <hi>Gersdorff.</hi> The Marquis of <hi>Barch,</hi> who in the Prince of <hi>Waldeck</hi>'s abſence, now ſick at <hi>Vienna,</hi> commanded the Troops of <hi>Franconia,</hi> advertiſed the Duke that he could not follow him with the Troops of his <hi>Circle,</hi> and ſent him the copy of an Order from Prince <hi>Waldeck,</hi> da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>26th.</hi> He received at the ſame time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Letter from the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> dated the day following, from his Camp at <hi>Ort,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Vienna,</hi> which gave him notice that the <hi>Franconians</hi> would not leave their Camp before they had received Orders from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their <hi>Circle,</hi> which he judged would be rather to recall, than cauſe them to advance. He added, that his Infantry being extremely weaken'd and diminiſhed by bloudy Fluxes, and his Cavalry ruined, his Troops could not ſo ſoon follow the Army of the Emperour; And yet if they would undertake any great action, where they ſhould be neceſſary, he would cauſe ſuch as were in condition to ſerve immediately to march.</p>
                  <p>The Duke apprehending that this ſeparation might put him out of condition of undertaking any thing conſiderable, ſent Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> to the Elector, who was gone to <hi>Bin,</hi> to change Ayr, by reaſon of ſome indiſpoſition of health; he was charged to perſwade him to let his Troops follow, remonſtrating to him that it would be a great matter, now that the Forces of the Chriſtians were diminiſhed, to hinder the Turks to take heart to oblige part of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> to ſubmit themſelves, to take Poſt for Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters in the Enemies Country, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by encourage the <hi>Franconians</hi> to follow their example.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Seaſon advanced; theſe Negotiations conſuming much time, and the Duke could make no ſtay upon command of the Troops he was not ſure of, and willing not to loſe the ſeaſon, he perſwaded the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to continue the march of the Army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Komorra,</hi> without the Allies. The King advancing always an hour before the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, they arrived near that City the ſecond of <hi>October;</hi> they camped at <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> and a Council of the Generals of the Army was held there, to know what the Imperialiſts might undertake, independent without the Allies, in caſe of delay or being abandoned.</p>
                  <p>Intelligence was brought, that <hi>Tekely</hi> with his Army encamped at <hi>Lewentz;</hi> that the groſs of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army lay about <hi>Buda;</hi> that the Grand Viſier had ſent a Detachment towards <hi>Gran,</hi> that he had put 4000 men into <hi>Newhauſel</hi> to fortifie that Garriſon, but that there were in the Enemies Army a great many diſcontented Perſons at the conduct of the Grand Viſier, by ſo much the more diſſatisfied, becauſe that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his return near <hi>Raab,</hi> he had cauſed the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier of <hi>Buda</hi> to be ſtrangled, as alſo ſome other Baſſa's, and more than fifty Subaltern Officers, whom he accuſed of not having done their duty in the late Battel; beſides that, he had alſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed a great number of thoſe Run-aways, who had preceded his retreat.</p>
                  <p>After the Council held at <hi>Wiſwar,</hi> they were not of opinion to attempt the Siege of <hi>Newhauſel</hi> in a ſeaſon ſo advanced, and in a Country full of Marſhes, the Garriſon being ſtrong, and a great Army in the Neighbourhood; neither was it thought reaſonable to propound the King's going againſt the Enemy, becauſe the Troops of the Empire had not followed, and that they ſhould be oblig'd to paſs through a Country where Forrage would be wanting.</p>
                  <p>The attack of <hi>Gran</hi> ſeemed but little feaſible before they were Maſters of <hi>Barcam,</hi> that the communication might be cut off. This inclined the Duke to attempt the Fort of <hi>Barcam,</hi> which is the head of the Bridge of <hi>Gran,</hi> after which they would further deliberate to paſs to <hi>Peſt,</hi> or beſiege <hi>Gran,</hi> according to the countenance of the Enemy. The Duke acquainted the King of <hi>Poland</hi> with what had been reſolved, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uto his Majeſty aſſented.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the King began to paſs that branch of the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Komorra,</hi> called the <hi>Waagh.</hi> The Emperours Horſe followed, and all the Cavalry marched to <hi>Moſe,</hi> where the Count of <hi>Starenberg</hi> was to be on the <hi>7th</hi> with the Infantry, the King having promiſed to ſtay for him there. The <hi>7th</hi> day, which ſhould have been a day of repoſe, to give the Infantry time to joyn the reſt of the Army, the King ſent to tell the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> that he would march towards <hi>Barcham,</hi> deſiring him that he would do the ſame. The Duke, ſurpriſed with the change, having thereupon ſounded to Horſe, ſent Count <hi>Dunewald</hi> to his Majeſty, to repreſent to him the neceſſity of expecting the Foot, and the danger there was in ſeparating in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Armies of the Turks and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and in the middle of their Garriſons. The Count found the King already on Horſeback, who anſwered him, that having advice that the detachment of the Turks towards <hi>Barcam</hi> was not great, he ſaw no inconvenience to continue his march. They ſeeing the King's reſolution followed him, leaving but one Company of <hi>Crawats</hi> to accompany the Infantry, which that day were to be at <hi>Moſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King being come within a League of <hi>Barcam,</hi> was advertiſed by his advanced Parties, that ſome Squadrons of the Enemy did appear. He ordered a detachment to charge them. They did not ſtand, but being relieved by a greater Body, the <hi>Poles</hi> who attacqued them were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
                  <p>The King commanded other Squadrons to ſecond them, which being engaged, he advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf with all his Horſe. The groſs of the <hi>Turks</hi> Cavalry, which had continued hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to covered by a great hill, unexpectedly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſix or 7000 ſtrong, and briskly charging the <hi>Poles</hi> in Flank and Front, put them to flight. The <hi>Turks</hi> charged them hotly in the diſorder they were, and killed above 2000 of them, and amongſt the reſt, the Palatine of <hi>Pomerania.</hi> They took Tymbals and Standards, and ſome Baggage, which by being intermingled with the march of the Troops, did ſomewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their defeat.</p>
                  <p>The Count of <hi>Dunewald,</hi> who had marched all day with the King, ſeeing the encounters of the firſt Squadrons, ſent to tell the Duke, that the <hi>Poles</hi> and the Enemy were engaged, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:39539:149"/>he marched ſwiftly, and filing through a narrow paſſage betwixt him and the Plain, he ſaw upon his arrival that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Horſe was quite broke, and that the <hi>Turks</hi> were cloſe in their purſuit. At this ſight, his firſt care was to put the Emperours moſt advanced Troops into Battalia, leaving room for the flying <hi>Poles,</hi> to avoid their running upon him. As ſoon as he had ſome Squadrons of his firſt Line formed, ſeeing the <hi>Poles</hi> ſtill in diſorder, he advanced upon the Enemy with his firſt Squadrons, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> to embattel the reſt. This motion ſtopt the Enemies carreer, after which they retired with ſome ſpeed under <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam,</hi> to avoid the Imperialiſts charge; whilſt the Duke advanced, the Queen of <hi>Polands</hi> Brother came to him, and told him, that he believed the King was loſt, becauſe his Majeſty was in the head of all in the places the moſt expoſed, to animate his Men by words, and inſpire courage into them by his example. The Duke ſeeing the Enemy retired, advanced towards the <hi>Poles.</hi> He found the King, who having advanced with the firſt, would be the laſt in retiring. He told the Duke how affairs had gone, and it being near Night, they thought of nothing but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping.</p>
                  <p>Fear and Terror had ſeiſed upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> as is uſual in ſuch Encounters, they could ſcarce be perſwaded to keep the Right, becauſe of the Neighbourhood of <hi>Barcam,</hi> whither the Enemy was retired; inſomuch that the King, for the greater ſecurity of his Troops, made them take the Left, deſiring the Duke to march into the right with the Emperours Troops, which theſe laſt had always pretended to; before they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, the Duke ſent Orders to Count <hi>Staren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> to make haſte and come and joyn him with the foot. The next Morning he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed that the <hi>Poles</hi> continued diſquieted; that the loſs they had ſuffered was extreamly ſenſible to them, that they would perſwade the King not to advance any further, but to retire to the Places deſigned for their Quarters; that the principal Officers were much divided, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally that many Difficulties were alledged to the King to hinder the Execution of the Reſolutions which had been taken.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who knew the Conſequence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Poliſh Army,</hi> and in caſe it ſeparated, they ſhould loſe the Fruit and Honour of the Campania, the which he deſired to ſee finiſhed with ſome handſome Action, and not upon a loſs, went to the Kings Quarters, and having found things as they had been repreſented, he endeavoured to perſwade his Majeſty to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Terms they had agreed upon. He demonſtrated to him and his Generals, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky conſequences that were to be feared if they changed deſign, how eaſie it was to force this detachment if they did not delay to attack them, the importance of doing it ſuddenly, for fear all the Forces of the Enemy might rejoyn them, and he inſiſted that they ſhould advance and charge them as ſoon as the Foot were come up. The King explained this Diſcourſe to the Senators and Officers of the Army that did not underſtand the Language, and in order to it agreed to march the next Morning, irreſolute only upon the ordering of the Battel.</p>
                  <p>The Duke, who had been viſiting the Ground, made a Deſcription to the King of it, and the Condition of <hi>Barcam,</hi> and afterwards diſcourſed of ſeveral forms of embattelling He propoſed that which they had held at <hi>Vienna,</hi> offering the right to his Majeſty, or to march as they were camped, and divided the <hi>Poles</hi> into the two Wings, which laſt propoſal was accepted of, and the Reſolution to march was taken.</p>
                  <p>The Army being put into Battalia with the Day, Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> commanded the right Wing, and under him Count <hi>Gondola</hi> and Baron <hi>Mercy,</hi> Count <hi>Dunewald</hi> was in the left, and with him the Counts <hi>Palſi</hi> and <hi>Taff.</hi> Count <hi>Starenberg,</hi> Marſhal of the Field, conducted the Infantry, with the Prince of <hi>Croy</hi> and Count <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin.</hi> This done, the Duke went to the King for the dividing of his Army. His Majeſty having been informed that the Enemies detachment had been augmented by ſeveral Troops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Haly</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> and by the Baſſaes of <hi>Syliſtria</hi> and <hi>Caire;</hi> and apprehending that theſe Troops were followed by the reſt, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated a-new upon the Enterpriſe; but the Duke repreſented to him many motives which made him believe the Army could not yet be come thither. He added, that if it were, he believed the Ground whereon they ſtood was ſo advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, that they ought not to change their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, being the Imperial Army poſſeſſed all the Plain, the <hi>Danube</hi> on the right, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the left, and that the Ground growing narrower towards the Enemies, they could not make uſe of a great body, though they had it; theſe reaſons being approved, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was divided. The King with a party of his <hi>Huſſars,</hi> of his Foot, and of his beſt Horſe, placed himſelf in the right, betwixt the Emperours Horſe and his Dragoons. The Great General <hi>Jabloriski</hi> did the ſame in the left, and the reſt of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army made a third Line; they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for half an hour in this Order. About nine a Clock they ſaw the Turks drawn up in the Plain before them. They moved juſtly, and by their firmneſs their Forces were judged equal with thoſe of the Chriſtians. Being come near the Troops that appeared, made a motion, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into three Lines, leaving only two great ſquadrons on their right. They then came and charged the left of the Chriſtian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with much fierceneſs, and ſearching the <hi>Poles,</hi> they attack'd the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> which the Great General Commanded.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time the groſs of the Turks, who were in the middle of the height, advanced to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the adverſe Foot, as if they would have charged them, and being come within half Muſquet-ſhot, they declined to the left of the Chriſtians, expoſing their Flank to relieve their own men. The Duke, who was gon towards his Infantry, ſeeing this motion, ran along the Line of the Horſe of the left Wing, and with all the party of the firſt Line, which had not yet charged, he himſelf advanced at the head of the Squadrons, and charged the Enemy in flank, which put them to a general rout, incapacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to make head again. He ordered <hi>Dunewald</hi> to purſue with the whole firſt Line, and with all the <hi>Poles</hi> of the ſame Wing, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them Pell-Mell to the very Gates of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kam,</hi> and the Marſhes of <hi>Gran,</hi> where many of them were ſlain.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt Count <hi>Dunewald</hi> chaſed the Enemy, the Duke cauſed the Army to advance in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia towards <hi>Barcam.</hi> The King having ſeen the flight of the Turks, was come from the right Wing to the left, to complement the Duke; the Generals and Senators who accompanied him, did the ſame. Amongſt the reſt <hi>Jablorisky,</hi> the Grand General of <hi>Poland,</hi> in preſence of all, avowed, that his People refuſing to advance to ſuſtain the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> the readineſs of Count <hi>Dune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> to ſuccour him, and the Vigour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Horſe had repaired that fault, and could
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:39539:150"/>not be ſufficiently commended. And now in the diſorder the Enemy was in, they reſolve to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Barcam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King cauſed ſome of his <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and the Duke added five Battalions of <hi>Starenberg,</hi> of <hi>Grana,</hi> and <hi>Baden,</hi> all under the conduct of Count <hi>Starenberg.</hi> This detachment was ſcarce ordered, when the Duke, who was approached to the Fort to inſpect it, was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that the Bridge upon the <hi>Danube</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the precipitate flight of the firſt Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aways, and that the crowding in <hi>Barkam,</hi> and upon the ſide to the River, were ſo great, that they ſeemed to be packed upon each other. He haſted thither, and would loſe no time upon ſuch an occaſion. He gave Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> orders to diſmount the Regiments of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, of <hi>Schults, Comfettein,</hi> and <hi>Caſtell,</hi> and to march to the Fort on that ſide to make a ſecond Attack. The command was inſtantly executed, and having ſent ſome parties of Foot by Water, and five pieces of Cannon charged with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages; he ordered that the Fort ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, whilſt the great and ſmall ſhot plyed their Vollies upon the Banks of the River. The Turks ſeeing themſelves thus preſſed on all ſides, could not withſtand the Attack, the place being forced, the Foot and Dragoons entering at the ſame time by the ways they attempted it.</p>
                  <p>The ſlaughter was terrible, though moſt of the defendants, to ſave themſelves from the fury of the aſſailants, precipitated themſelves into the <hi>Danube,</hi> ſome leap'd in with their Horſes, others tried to paſs by ſwimming, holding by the Mane and tailes of their Horſes, or ſome plank or piece of the broken Bridge, and there were ſome who crept over the dead bodies which were held by the cordage and pieces of wood remaining where the breach was. This ſlaughter continuing long, the number of the dead was very great, all that part of the <hi>Danube</hi> near the ſhore, not being very rapid, being filled with them; all the ſurface of the River, where largeſt, being covered with cloaths, and the equipage of Men and Horſes, and there did not eſcape above ſeven or 800 of all this multitude, who found their preſervation in the king of a Redoubt which was at <hi>Barcam,</hi> where they had put themſelves, and from whence they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded quarter, and had it.</p>
                  <p>The Town being garriſoned with <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Poles,</hi> Count <hi>Staremberg,</hi> ſeeing theſe two Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ready to murther each other for the booty, removed the Imperialiſts, having only the <hi>Poles</hi> there, who awhile after burnt <hi>Barcam,</hi> and all the Palliſado's that encloſed it, becauſe the Turks had placed the Heads of the <hi>Poles</hi> ſlain in the late Engagement upon the tops of them.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> who had orders from the Grand Viſier to joyn with the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> at <hi>Barkam,</hi> was advanced upon the Mountains within two miles of it, but being informed by thoſe he ſent to diſcover what the Chriſtians did, of what was paſſed, he retired with much diligence.</p>
                  <p>By Letters from <hi>Gran,</hi> as alſo by the relation of Priſoners, there were not 3000 men of all this detachment of 14000 Horſe, and 1200 Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſaries ſaved. They were the Hower of their Army, commanded by the <hi>Baſſa</hi> of <hi>Buda, Haly</hi> Baſſa of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> the Baſſa of <hi>Siliſtria,</hi> and ſome Aga's The booty was great, above ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſes being taken, and the Tymbals and the Baggage which the <hi>Poles</hi> had left, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>This Victoty did not only re-aſſure the <hi>Poles,</hi> but put the Male-contents into a deſpondency, and did ſo ſtrongly increaſe the diſorders in the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Army, that the Grand Viſier, unable to maſter them, was obliged to retire.</p>
                  <p>The next thing the Chriſtians undertook, was the Siege of <hi>Gran,</hi> though the Duke had need of all his Reaſons and elocution to perſwade the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to it, but having at length con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Forces being come up, three Batteries were forthwith raiſed; and ten great Guns were by force of men, as alſo eight Mortars drawn up the Mountains of <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> deſerted by the Enemy. The Caſtle was ſtrongly battered on the Gate, on the <hi>Buda</hi> ſide great quantity of Bombs were thrown in, and the ſhooting laſted all day. The Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts advanced to the Ditch, and lodged there on the ſide of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> approaches. They advanced to the foot of the Wall, which lookt towards <hi>Barcam,</hi> and about five in the evening, ſome commanded Battalions of the Imperialiſts attack'd the City on the other extremity, and carried it without reſiſtance; for as much as the Enemy having retired, contented themſelves to defend it by their great firing from the Caſtle, from whence the very ſills of the Houſes are diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>The Imperialiſts being maſters of the City, the <hi>Bavarians</hi> in the Night gained the foot of the Caſtle, where they fell to Mining, whilſt the Imperialiſts leaped into the Mote, and lodged there. Several men were loſt there by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Bombs, Granadoes, Stones, &amp;c. which they continually threw amongſt them, whilſt they were covering themſelves. The Cannon beginning to make a breach about Ten Clock, and the Miner at work, a Summons was ſent in by a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Priſoner, with offer of goods and life, if they would ſurrender the place before the day was ended. The beſieged demanded till the morrow, which being refuſed, the firing of the Artillery, Musquets, and Bombs were re-doubled. They paſſed the Moat, made two Lodgments, by favour whereof they attacked the Miner in a ſecond place on the <hi>Martinberg</hi> ſide. This advantage obliged the <hi>Turks</hi> to ſend an Officer about Eleven at Night to declare, that they accepted the offer which had been made them, demanding Hoſtages whilſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations were a making, and offering theirs.</p>
                  <p>The 27th, the Hoſtages being delivered, it was agreed, that the Garriſon ſhould march out with Arms and Baggage, and that it ſhould be conducted in ſafety to <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Vicegrade;</hi> that the Artillery and Munitions of War and Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als ſhould remain in the place, and that the Turks ſhould deliver up their Chriſtian Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                  <p>The impreſſion that the battel of <hi>Barcam</hi> had made; the vigor and readineſs wherewith they had gained the foot of the Walls, the Grand Viſier's retreat, the Bombs which were thrown without ceaſing, into a place ſo full of People as this, had cauſed ſo much terror and ſo much confuſion, that though there were above 4000 effective men in the Garriſon, commanded by two Baſſa's, a Bey, and many Officers, we have ſeen a place reduced in five days, which in the two former Sieges had held out ſeveral Months, with weaker Garriſons, againſt more numerous Armies.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon being too far advanced for further action, the Allies returned home, and the <hi>Poles,</hi> together with the Imperialiſts marched into their Winter-Quarters.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, the Grand Viſier being come to Court, told the Grand Seignior the ſame things he had writ to him againſt the Baſſa
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:39539:150"/>of Buda, and perſwaded him to approve of the rigor wherewith he had treated him. He alſo accuſed Count <hi>Tekely</hi> of having ill ſeconded him; and finally, he knew ſo well to juſtifie his conduct with his Maſter, that he hindered the Widdow of that Baſſa, who was his Highneſs's Siſter, to complain againſt him for ſo barbarous an action, and procured an Order to be ſent her from the <hi>Sultan</hi> to go immediately to <hi>Adrianople</hi> without ſeeing him. When this Princeſs arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there, ſhe found the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> dead, which cauſed her a ſenſible diſpleaſure; becauſe ſhe had relied much upon the credit of this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who having a great averſion for <hi>Cara Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtafa,</hi> would not have been wanting in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the vengeance ſhe would take of this Miniſter; but ſhe learn'd from <hi>Kiſler Agaſi,</hi> or the chief of the black Eunukes, that <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> had charged him upon her Death-bed, to tell the Grand Seignior upon his return to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> that <hi>Cara Muſtapha</hi> had a deſign to make himſelf Emperour of the Weſt, grounded upon a Prediction told him, that he ſhould one day be Maſter of one of the greateſt Empires of the World. But whether this Prediction were true, or that the <hi>Sultana Valide</hi> had invented it to deſtroy the Viſier, the news of it did extremely comfort the Baſſa of <hi>Buda's</hi> Widdow, who wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the return of the <hi>Sultan</hi> with impatience, to execute the deſign which ſhe had againſt this Miniſter, and revenge the loſs of her Husband by his death.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon being far advanced, the Grand Seignior, leaving <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> at <hi>Belgrade</hi> to take care of his Army, and the places in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> during the Winter quarter, returned to <hi>Adrianople.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Chriſtians got every day ſome new ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over the <hi>Turks,</hi> and that the Grand Viſier did nothing to repell them, his ſecret Enemies, and principally the <hi>Kiſler Agaſi,</hi> and the <hi>Kaimacan,</hi> who was jealous of his greatneſs, took ocaſion hence to decry the conduct of the Grand Viſier unto their Maſter. At this time Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> who was accuſtomed to receive great Subſidies from the Port, and who had his Spies near his Highneſs, by whom he was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully advertiſed of all that happened, knowing that he had been rendered ſuſpect to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that there was no more mention of ſending him Supplies as uſual, did by his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters omit nothing for his juſtification, but to no purpoſe. His Letters did not diſabuſe the Grand Seignior, who entirely believing what he had received from <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> was perſwaded that this Count was of Intelligence with the Imperialiſts. <hi>Tekely</hi> ſeeing no middle betwixt his ruine and his juſtification, took the moſt dangerous Party. He went <hi>Incognito</hi> to <hi>Adrianople,</hi> and having by the credit of <hi>Kiſler Agaſi,</hi> who was his particular friend, found means of admiſſion to the <hi>Sultans</hi> preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom, proſtrated with his face upon the Earth, he declared to him that he brought him his Head, and that he would rather loſe it, than be expoſed to the calumny of his Enemies, and to the diſgrace of his Protector. <hi>Tekely's</hi> boldneſs look'd well. The Grand Seignior gave ear to his reaſons, and judged by the relation that he made him, that all the misfortunes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and ſince, ought to be imputed to the ill conduct of his Viſier. He permitted <hi>Tekely</hi> to return, aſſuring him of the protection he demanded, and engaged himſelf to ſend him ſuch powerful Succours, that he ſhould in a little time be in a condition to repair with advantage all the loſſes he had ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>And now they begin to make complaints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Viſier, and the loſs of <hi>Gran</hi> did not a little contribute to his ruine. The Janizaries, that the Viſier's ſecret enemies had cauſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble tumultuarily, and demand his Head, under pretence that he had abandoned their Companions in the Trenches at <hi>Vienna;</hi> and this was a killing blow, ſo that the death of <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> was reſolved in a Divan, which the Grand Seignior had cauſed to be aſſembled to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>This fatal Commiſſion was given <hi>Chiaoux</hi> Baſſa, and to <hi>Kapiglier Kiaia,</hi> who immediately took Poſt for <hi>Belgrade.</hi> They arrived there the 25th of <hi>December,</hi> and addreſſing themſelves to the Aga of the Janizaries, they communicated the Emperours Orders to him, which implied that he ſhould give them all neceſſary aſſiſtance. The Aga diſpoſed ſuch as depended on him to obey, and went with theſe two Officers into the Grand Viſier's houſe. <hi>Cara Muſtapha,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from his Chamber, did quickly ſuppoſe that his Enemies had taken advantage of his abſence to ruine him, and thoſe that he ſaw coming were to execute the Arreſt of his death. Some Officers, who owed him their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, being then with him, and having heard him ſay what he thought, propoſed to him to refuſe the Door to the Aga, and them that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him: they repreſented to him that he was beloved by the Souldiers, and if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared but in his defence, he would inſtantly ſee a number of brave men for his defence.</p>
                  <p>But this great Miniſter, whoſe life ſeemed odious to him after the affront which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before <hi>Vienna,</hi> and who knew well, he could but defer his death for few days, being incir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with the Enemies of his Religion, who would not fail to profit by the diviſion of his Troops, believed that by his laſt ſubmiſſion to his Highneſs orders, he ought to diſabuſe thoſe who believed him little attach'd to the Law, or rather he found himſelf ſo irreſolute in ſo preſſing a danger, that the <hi>Sultans</hi> three Officers entered his Chamber before he had taken his laſt reſolution. He endeavoured to hide the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of his Soul, and after he had returned them their civilities, he asked the cauſe of their coming. The Aga taking the word, told him, that his Highneſs had ſent for the Seal of the Empire, which he had entruſted him with, and ſhewed him the order in Writing. At the ſame time the Viſier opening his boſom drew it out, which he preſented to him with reſpect, asking whether they had any thing elſe to require from him? he was obliged to render the Standard, which he did in the ſame fashion; and having yet again demanded, whether they would have any thing elſe, the three Officers anſwered him only with tears, letting him at the ſame time ſee in writing the <hi>Buyurds</hi> or Command, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Grand Seignior would have his Head. <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> was not affrighted, being already prepared for it. He only asked, if the might not be permitted to ſay his Prayers. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers anſwered him, that they had no orders to refuſe him that conſoiation. He ordered his People to retire, that he might pray with leſs diſtraction, and when he had finiſhed, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entered again. He then drew a Paper out of his boſom, which he gave to the Aga, to render it to his Highneſs. It is believed that it was a Billet, by which the <hi>Sultan</hi> promiſed him never to put him to death, which he would make no uſe of, judging it uſeleſs, being he was too far from the Grand Seignior to undrſtand his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. He then ſat upon the brink of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:39539:151"/>whereof he lift up the Carpet, to the end to be only upon the Plank, demanding he might be ſtrangled by his own Executioner, which was granted. After a few Moments to diſpoſe of himſelf, he called the Executioner, and told him he ſhould be quick, and not let him lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; he ſaid alſo, that the Grand Seignior would think on him after his Death. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner having put the ſtring about his Neck, he himſelf diſentangled it, ſaying, it was not neceſſary they ſhould hold his hands. As ſoon as he was dead, the Executioner cut off his Head, and flead it, filling the Skin with hacked Straw, which was put into a Box, and carried to <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anople,</hi> and given to the Sultan, who received it without any great Emotion, as he was coming from hunting.</p>
                  <p>The Viſiers Corps was carried out of his Chamber, and expoſed under a Pavilion to be ſeen of all Men. At the ſame time they ſeiſed on his principal Officers, who were brought to <hi>Adrianople.</hi> Of theſe the <hi>Reiz Effendi</hi> was hang'd, <hi>Mauro Cordato</hi> his Interpreter put in the Caſtle of the ſeven Towers at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> having firſt been ſpoiled of his Money and Jewels.</p>
                  <p>There were found in the Treaſury of this Miniſter, ten or twelve Milions in Money, Moveables and Jewels, which is very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if the prodigious Expences of Preſents be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; theſe Spoils, and thoſe of ſome of the Viſiers Officers, and of the Tefterder, who was likewiſe ſtrangled, amounted to fourteen Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which came all into the Grand Seigniors Purſe. He refuſed to conſent that this Moneys ſhould be employed to pay the Troops, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the Affairs of <hi>Hungary,</hi> although all the Divan was of that Opinion. The Sultan would neither ſuffer them to open his Treaſury, which is the great reſource of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperours, and replyed to them that repreſented to him the neceſſity of doing it, that they muſt make uſe of the accuſtomed Revenues, and if that did not ſuffice, it was for his Council to ſearch out other ways to ſupply it. And yet he was pleaſed to give all the Viſiers immoveables to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. This Humour of his Highneſs, and the Difficulties which were foreſeen to ſettle the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Empire, diminiſhed the heat of ſuch who might pretend to the Employment of Grand Viſier. The <hi>Kiſler Agaſi,</hi> who was always in great Credit, and who fancied, though without any ground, that the Grand Seignior had thoughts of placing him in this Poſt, declared before hand, that he would not accept of this Office, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had not Capacity enough to bear the weight of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Solyman Aga Selietar,</hi> who was his Highneſſes true Favorite, and who judg'd he ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways powerful enough whilſt he had his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Favour, ſignified to the Sultan, who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make him Grand Viſier, that all his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was to pleaſe him, and that he eſteemed more the waiting upon his Perſon, than to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his Cares betwixt his Prince and the State, as he ſhould be obliged to do, if he accepted the charge wherewith he would honour him. So obliging a denyal augmenting the eſteem and affection which the Grand Seignior had for him, diſpoſed him to name <hi>Ibrahim Aga,</hi> who was <hi>Kaymacan,</hi> and formerly called <hi>Kara Kiaia,</hi> for this high Employment.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians continuing their Progreſs in <hi>Hungary,</hi> obliged this new Grand Viſier to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Divan very often, to find a way to re-eſtabliſh their Affairs. He propoſed the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a Peace with the Emperour, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Trevis which <hi>Kara Muſtapha</hi> had vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated without any lawful pretence, and to carry the War into <hi>Poland,</hi> to revenge themſelves on King <hi>John,</hi> for the ill ſucceſs of the Siege of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna.</hi> But the Sultan, who had promiſed Count <hi>Tekely</hi> that he would not abandon him, was of a contrary ſentiment. <hi>Kara Kiaia</hi> urging his Opinion with too much heat, the Sultan grew ſo angry with him, that he was judged loſt, which gave room to that falſe report that ran of him that he was ſtrangled, and that <hi>Kana Houglou Camaikan</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was put in his place.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the Officers of the Garriſons being changed, the new Viſier employed all his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to raiſe ſuch Forces againſt Spring, as might ſalve the diſgraces of the laſt Campaign, which yet they could not compaſs, the People being dejected even to Conſternation at ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſſes.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Chriſtians having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily finiſhed their Campaign, and taken their Quarters in <hi>Hungary,</hi> uſed great diligence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Moneys, to ſeparate the <hi>Hungarians</hi> from the Port, and to make new Alliances.</p>
                  <p>There was but the <hi>Pope</hi> that could travel ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually in the firſt of theſe things, ſeeing the other Princes of the Empire had enough to do for themſelves, as long as the differences with <hi>France</hi> were not accommodated, beſides the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants could obtain no advantage for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
                  <p>To effect the ſecond point, a general Act of Oblivion was publiſhed by the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, with pardon to all that would return to their Obedience, and Commiſſioners being ſent to <hi>Presburg</hi> to receive their Submiſſions, very many of the Nobility, Counties, and Towns were reſtored to their Duty as at the beginning, though <hi>Tekely</hi> would not, and the chief Towns in upper <hi>Hungary</hi> for fear of him, did not as yet dare to declare themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But the third deſign had better Succeſs, for however the <hi>Czars</hi> of <hi>Muſcovia</hi> would not give ear to the Emperours Invitation and Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Alliance made him by his Ambaſſador <hi>Blomberg,</hi> yet the <hi>Venetians,</hi> ſhewing a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to be revenged of the loſſes they had ſuffered by the Wars of <hi>Candy,</hi> eaſily conſented to the accompliſhment of the League between the Emperour, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Alliance was to be offenſive; none of the concerned ſhould treat ſeparately upon any Conditions whatſoever; that this League ſhall tend to no other thing but to make War againſt the Turks; the Emperour and the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſhall act by Land with all their Forces, and the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> with a Naval Army at Sea, and a Land Army in <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> that the War be made by diverſion, the Emperour ſhall endeavour to recover <hi>Hungary,</hi> the <hi>Poles Kaminiec,</hi> and all the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>kraine,</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> all ſhe has loſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whilſt this was in concluding, there came News to the Imperial Court, of a very great defeat the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> had given the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> the Chieftains of the <hi>Tartars</hi> being both ſlain, and <hi>Haly Beg,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Turks,</hi> taken Priſoner, who, though he offered a hundred thouſand Crowns for his Ranſom, was ſlain by the quarrelling <hi>Coſſack</hi> in the heat of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt about him.</p>
                  <p>But now the Seaſon did invite both ſides into the Field, where the Chriſtians were chiefly Aggreſſors. The Chriſtian Army in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>June</hi> aſſembled at their general Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous betwixt <hi>Schinta</hi> and <hi>Shella,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:39539:151"/>of thirty thouſand Men, from whence, after ſome ſtay, they paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> near <hi>Gran;</hi> it was believed that the deſign was formed againſt <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and the rather, becauſe it had been ſo greatly ſtreightned by General <hi>Mercy,</hi> who had block'd it up all the Winter, and reduced it to the Condition, as was ſuppoſed, of a voluntary ſurrender. But it was at length diſcovered that <hi>Buda</hi> was at the bottom of the Deſign, as a thing of greater Conſequence, being therefore to leave no Place behind them, the Army was tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> a place ſcituate upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> having left their Baggage under the Cannon of <hi>Gran;</hi> and having without much labour ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred themſelves Maſters of the City, the Turks that were in the Caſtle ſurrendered the next day, marching out to the number of ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty men. In the mean time, the Turks of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> and the Neighbour Garriſons, to the number of ſix thouſand, unexpectedly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the Baggage at <hi>Gran,</hi> but were ſo rudely received, that having loſt two hundred of their Men, and four Colours, they were forced to give back. Major General <hi>Halloweil</hi> of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts was ſlain in this Fight.</p>
                  <p>But the Turks, ſollicitous for <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> and finding they could not ſufficiently relieve it with ſmall Parties, reſolved to attempt it with an Army, and being advanced as far as <hi>Vacia,</hi> the Duke reſolved to oppoſe them. To this purpoſe he ſet forwards, and found them drawn up in Battalia upon the heights near the Town. The place was of difficult acceſs, having on the left the <hi>Danube,</hi> and a large Moraſs, and the right ſecured by a Wood. The Duke having embat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telled his men, moved directly towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and about Eleven of the Clock paſſed the Moraſs, without any great oppoſition, till being come upon the heights, they were then charged with great fury, but the Turks not being able to break them the firſt time, they bravely at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked them the ſecond, and third time; but with like ſucceſs, ſtill repelled, eſpecially the third time with great loſs, and forced to ſave themſelves by flight. The Foot ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Caſtle, but were forced to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at diſcretion, after three hours reſiſtance. <hi>Novigrade</hi> was hereupon quitted by the Turks, and as ſoon poſſeſt by the Imperialiſts.</p>
                  <p>This Victory animated the Chriſtians to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their march to <hi>Peſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jun. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note> whither being come, they caſt a great number of Bombs into the Town, with that ſucceſs, that the fire taking in ſeveral places of it, frightned the Garriſon ſo, that taking their beſt moveables with them, they fled into <hi>Buda,</hi> after they had alſo reduced ſome Houſes in the Town to aſhes, and fired the Bridge behind them. But the Chriſtians taking poſſeſſion of <hi>Peſt,</hi> quenched the fire, repaired the fortifications, and battered <hi>Buda</hi> with the Artillery they found in the place.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto fortune had been ſo favourable to the Imperialiſts,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi>
                     </note> that they began to think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inſuperable to their courage. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion made them paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> again, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Siege of <hi>Offen,</hi> or <hi>Buda,</hi> the Capital of the Kingdom, ſometimes the Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and now of the Baſſa's, that govern that wealthy Kingdom with no leſs authority. After ſome ruffling and skirmiſhes, the City was inveſted, and the Suburbs taken without any great oppoſition. The Turks like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe quitted St. <hi>Gerards</hi> Hill, and the beſiegers began to batter the Walls with their Artillery.</p>
                  <p>The Turks abroad were not idle, for having got twenty thouſand Men together, they were reſolved to attempt the relief of <hi>Buda.</hi> But the Chriſtians having left all their Foot, with what Horſe was neceſſary to continue the Siege, they marched with the reſt of the Cavalry, one thouſand Foot under the command of Count <hi>Aversberg,</hi> and two thouſand five hundred <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> of Count <hi>Eſterhaſis.</hi> The Duke marched all Night to find out the Enemy, who, though well trenched, at ſight of the Chriſtians came out of their Camp, and embattell'd themſelves for their defence. The diſpute laſted near four hours, the Turks making ſeveral motions to gain the Flanks of the Enemy, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the Chriſtians uſed all poſſible diligence to prevent them, and engaging at length, after a ſharp fight, the Infidels being diſordered, were put to flight, and ſo cloſely purſued, that not only their Camp and Cannon were taken, but at leaſt four thouſand of them ſlain, and the great Standard, the badge of the Grand Viſier's dignity alſo ſurpriſed.</p>
                  <p>After this Victory, the Duke returning to the Siege, ſummoned the place, but received for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that the Governour had in the preſence of his Meſſengers cauſed forty Chriſtian Slaves to be hewed in pieces, ſaying, he wiſhed he could do as much to all the Chriſtian Army. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of this, the Chriſtians aſſaulted the place, but in vain, though upon a ſecond attempt they carried the lower Town, with their Swords in their hands, notwithſtanding the oppoſition they found was great. They raiſed a Battery there of twenty four Cannon, and ſeventeen Mortars, from whence, as alſo St. <hi>Gerards</hi> hill, they battered the City. Nor were the beſieged idle, who made a brave ſally upon the Beſiegers, wherein they ſlew ſome hundreds of them, with ſeveral conſiderable Officers, beſides the wounded.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Army beginning to want For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, they made a Bridge to paſs to the Iſle of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> from whence they might be the better provided with all things. Many were the attempts, the batteries, the ſallies, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours on both ſides. The Chriſtians endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hinder the Turks, though in vain, from watering at the <hi>Danube.</hi> The Chriſtians ſprung a Mine by the great Tower, which did indeed take effect, but it was found that the Turks were too well provided to hazard an aſſault. About mid-<hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Governour, or Viſier of <hi>Buda, Kara Mehemet,</hi> was kill'd with a ſhot he received in his face, a Perſon very brave, and very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Ephraim</hi> Baſſa ſucceeded him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but did not enjoy it long, being like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſlain with a Cannon Bullet, ſo that the Chief command was devolved upon the Aga of the Janizaries.</p>
                  <p>As the attack was vigorous, ſo the defence was brave, the Turks continually vexing the Chriſtians with their Alarms and Sallies, who on the other ſide continued their approaches with great reſolution, but their Foot being much ſpent, it was judged adviſable not to hazard a General aſſault, before the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Forces, which were daily expected, were come up.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the Serasquier Baſſa formed a deſign to make a diverſion ſome other way, in order to which he marches towards the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of <hi>Croatia,</hi> where General <hi>Leſley</hi> was cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, who had beſieged <hi>Virovitza</hi> in <hi>July,</hi> beaten the relief deſigned for their ſuccour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon had the place ſurrendered to him upon compoſition. Having now notice of the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquier's deſign, he went and poſted himſelf within half a League off his Camp, near a Bridge that was lay'd over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Turanowitz.</hi> A while after the Turks approached, who charged
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:39539:152"/>with great fury eight hundred Croats, newly come to the Imperial Camp, but with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed misfortune. They however returned immediately to the fight, and forced the Croats to retire, leaving them three Standards for priſe, ſo that being animated with this advantage, they would attempt more, and attacked the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts in their <hi>Post;</hi> but they were ſo ill received, that they were obliged to retire with the loſs of five hundred men, which were killed upon the place. The Chriſtians loſt two hundred.</p>
                  <p>Though this Siege, for the Greatneſs and Fame of it, deſerves to be deſcribed in all its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, the Approaches, the Attacks, the Mines, the Battels, the Batteries, the Breaches of the Chriſtians being carried on with ſo much Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Conſtancy, that it amazed the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World; yet the Greatneſs of the Garriſon, the Scituation and Strength of the Place, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated Succours that were brought in, a potent Army commanded by a <hi>Seraskier,</hi> within the noiſe of their Guns, yea, oft-times their view; a vigorous and intrepid Courage in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, frequent and furious Sallies, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, and the advance of a wet Seaſon ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to them, rendred all the Endeavours of the Beſiegers fruitleſs, and forced them to a Retreat.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had indeed brought with his Perſon, a conſiderable recruit to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, and they performed all that Courage could ſuggeſt; but being the fatal moment of the reducing of this Capital City of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was not yet come, we will tranſmit the Hiſtory of it till then, when the ſame great Atchievements were in a manner acted over again, and indeed by the ſame Generals on the ſide of the Chriſtians, but with better fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Siege had laſted from the fourteenth of <hi>July,</hi> till the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> at which time the Chriſtians having tranſported their Baggage, their ſick, and ſome pieces of Artillery to the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew;</hi> the Army ſending their great Cannon, their Ammunition, and the reſt of their Baggage by Water, for want of draught-Horſes, though well convoyed, followed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Body uninterrupted, and marched to their Winter Quarters, the <hi>Bavarians</hi> into up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Hungary,</hi> and the Imperialiſts into both the upper and lower <hi>Hungary, Bohemia, Sileſia, &amp;c.</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Repartitions.</p>
                  <p>The Turks attempted nothing upon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in their retreat, but brought near a thouſand Priſoners, which were left in the Iſle of St. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> into the City, not ſingly triumphing for ſo ſignal a deliverance.</p>
                  <p>Such was the end of this bloody Siege, where, following the common Opinion, the Emperour loſt twenty thouſand Men, and amongſt them a great number of Officers. Of thoſe of moſt note were the Counts of <hi>Altheim,</hi> two of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rembergs, James</hi> and <hi>Lewis, Carlowitz, Richtari, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-Zollern, Furſtenburg, Naſſau, Durheim, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minz,</hi> and the young Counts of <hi>Harrah,</hi> and great quantity of others.</p>

                     </note> Their Doge or Prince being dead, <hi>Marco Antonio Juſtiniano</hi> being elected Duke in his place, the Senate ſent orders to their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Capello,</hi> at the Ottoman <hi>Port</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the concluſion of the Alliance made with the Emperour and <hi>Poland,</hi> to declare War againſt the Turks, and to ſave himſelf as well as he could, which he did; for having ſcarce finiſhed his Declaration, he retired from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> in the habit of a Sea-man, and embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked himſelf upon a <hi>French</hi> Ship. But two of his Domeſticks, and ſix other ſervants, had the misfortune to be taken, whilſt the Merchants of his Nation took Sanctuary in the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour's Palace. The <hi>Kaimacan</hi> of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople</hi> would ſearch whether <hi>Capello</hi> was not there alſo, but the Ambaſſadour anſwered him, if he came to re-ſearch there without expreſs orders from the Grand Seignior, he ſhould repent it, which ſo diſcompoſed him, that after ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, he proceeded no further.</p>
                  <p>The Council chooſing their great Officers, made <hi>Moroſini</hi> Captain General, <hi>Mocenigo</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer General of <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> General of the Infantry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> General <hi>Strozoldo</hi> paſſed out of the Emperour's ſervice, to that of this Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Morlacks</hi> did likewiſe, for the moſt part, embrace the Party of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> holding the Turks in perpetual Alarms, making oft-times very conſiderable Booty, perpetually peſtering them with their ravagings and excurſions.</p>
                  <p>The General Rendezvouz of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet was at <hi>Corfu,</hi> where the Gallies of the Pope, of <hi>Malta,</hi> and of <hi>Tuſcany</hi> joyning with them, conſiſting in all of forty-ſix Gallies, ſix Galliaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thirty-three Men of War, beſides other ſmaller Veſſels, manned with above twenty thouſand Foot, and five or ſix hundred Horſe. A General Council of War being held in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of all the Chief of the Auxiliary Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, it was reſolved to attempt the Iſland of St. <hi>Maure,</hi> in purſuance whereof, arriving before the Iſland about the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Port of <hi>Dameta,</hi> on the Eaſt ſide of the Iſland, where alſo they made their deſcent.

Having taken their Poſts, the Generaliſſimo ſent a Summons to them in the Fort, to ſurrender it, which they with contempt refuſing, the Chriſtians began to batter the Town from their Gallies and Galliaſſes, whereby the houſes and fortifications of the City were greatly endamaged, as alſo a Moſque, which was ruined; and however the Turks were not wanting in their defence, yet they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtians to lodge in the Suburbs, and to raiſe Batteries, which did greatly prejudice the Walls, beſides that the Bombs did very great harm in the City. The firſt of <hi>August,</hi> a great Breach was made in the Wall, one of their Bulwarks being much ruined, and four of their Pieces of <hi>Cannon</hi> rendred uſeleſs to the Beſieged; beſides, the Town flamed in ſeveral parts, being fired by the Bombs; by favour of which advantages the <hi>Venetians</hi> advanced their approaches ſo well, that they began already to fill the Ditch, and making every thing ready for a general aſſault. Things being at this paſs, General <hi>Moroſini,</hi> by an unaccuſtomed kind of Clemency, ſent them a ſecond Summons, which they accepting off, hung out towards evening a white Flag, and about one in the Morning, ſent three Deputies, to notifie they were content to ſurrender, upon condition they might carry all their goods with them, but they could obtain no more, than to march out with their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and what they could carry. Hoſtages were next Morning delivered on both ſides, and all the Slaves were releaſed, ſave that they were
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:39539:152"/>obliged to ſerve as Sea-men in the Gallies of the Common-wealth for a year. The Garriſon with their Army, ſeven hundred in number, marched out that evening by the Weſt Port, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> entred by the breach into the City,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Maura</hi> taken.</note> where they found ſtore of Proviſion, and eighty Pieces of Ordinance, twenty whereof had the Arms of St. <hi>Mark</hi> upon them. During the time of the Siege, which laſted ſeventeen days, the Chriſtians loſt four-hundred men, and the Turks near three hundred.</p>
                  <p>And thus this Neſt of Pirates, (the <hi>Leucade</hi> of the Ancients) about ſeventy miles round, and well peopled, and in the poſſeſſion of the Turks ever ſince <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond's time, was re-taken in leſs than three Weeks, with ſo inconſiderable a loſs. The General cauſed the Moſques forthwith to be re-conſecrated, and <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung in them for ſo happy a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, which was alſo celebrated in <hi>Venice</hi> with great magnificence.</p>
                  <p>After the fortifications of this place were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and the Garriſon provided with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, the Government of it being given to <hi>Laurence Venier,</hi> as extraordinary Provider, and to <hi>Phillip Parictz</hi> in ordinary, both Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> the General choſe two thouſand <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> the remainder of thoſe which were in a condition to march, by reaſon of the manifold ſickneſſes that reigned amongſt the Souldiery, and diſpatched them with Collonel <hi>Angelo,</hi> to aſſemble all the <hi>Grecians</hi> he could get together. and tranſported himſelf to the haven of <hi>Pettala,</hi> in expectation of the ſaid Collonel's enterpriſe. He went thence, and ancred in the haven or Port of <hi>Dragomeſtro,</hi> where landing with two thouſand <hi>Venetians,</hi> and one thouſand of the Auxiliaries, he joyned himſelf with fifteen or ſixteen hundred <hi>Grecians.</hi> Theſe Troops rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Country, chaſed the men which <hi>Saban</hi> Baſſa, Governour of <hi>Prevezza,</hi> had poſted to obſerve the Chriſtians. Having allured the ſaid Baſſa into the field, burnt ſome Villages, and pillaged the Country five days together, they re-imbark'd at <hi>Pettala,</hi> and ſailed thence to the Haven of <hi>Dameta.</hi> There, at a Council of War, the reſolution of attacking <hi>Prevezza</hi> was taken, it being the only place that covered the Iſland of St. <hi>Maur,</hi> being ſome twelve miles diſtant from it. In order to this deſign, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſent five Gallies, and ſix Galliaſſes towards the Caſtles called the <hi>Gomenizze,</hi> within ſight of the Fortreſs, to oblige the Turks to divide their Forces, which alſo happened; for upon a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the Chriſtians would attempt the Towers, they ſent moſt of their Men thither: The Army parted from <hi>Dameta</hi> the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> and came to anchor that evening at the mouth of the Gulph of <hi>Arta</hi> or <hi>Ambracia,</hi> that City being famous for the Reſidence of King <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> and its Gulf, for the Victory of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> againſt <hi>Marc Anthony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next day the Captain <hi>Monetta,</hi> who was come with twenty four Barks and Brigantines, landed his Troops, being aſſiſted by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Gallies, which hindred the Turks from daring to appear upon the ſhore, before the <hi>Venetians</hi> were drawn up into Battalia by General <hi>Strozoldo,</hi> and had forced five hundred Spahis, who came to charge them, to retire. They took the Caſtle without difficulty, and poſted themſelves upon a height which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the City. The General thereupon ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned the place, but the Officer who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in chief in the abſence of <hi>Saba</hi> Baſſa, refuſed the Letter and Meſſenger, ſhooting at the later, upon confidence of being relieved by his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour. Several Mortars and Cannon were landed, and Batteries being raiſed, the place was ſorely canonado'd, in ſo much that all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Pieces but one were diſmounted. The twenty fourth, they carried their Approaches into the Moat, and by Favour of the Obſcurity of the Night, carried their Mine under the great Tower. The twenty eighth they made a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Ditch, and the Breach being very large,<note place="margin">As alſo <hi>Preveza.</hi>
                     </note> Order was given for the Aſſault as ſoon as the Mine had played; but the Turks, ſenſible of their Danger, prevented it by hanging out a Flag of Truce. They demanded the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with them at St. <hi>Maur,</hi> though but thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the principal were ſuffered to go out with Arms and Baggage, the reſt being only allowed what they could carry about them.

The Winter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing apace, the Auxiliaries returned to their ſeveral Homes, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> to their Iſles to paſs the Seaſon there.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dalmatia</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> happily ended their Campania with the taking of <hi>Narenta.</hi>

                  <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> did not take the Field this year before mid-<hi>August,</hi> after the Troops which had been laſt year in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> had joyned his Army.

Hoſtages were given on both ſides, and the Articles quickly ſigned, according to which the Garriſon march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out with their Arms, to the number of five hundred men. The King turned hence towards <hi>Swaniec,</hi> near the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> over which he cauſed a Bridge to be lay'd, and his Army to paſs it. But he quickly repaſſed it again, upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he received, that thirty thouſand <hi>Tartars</hi> had paſſed this River, with deſign to make an irruption into <hi>Poland.</hi> His Majeſty going in queſt of them, had the luck to cut four hundred of them in pieces, but he could not ingage them in a formal battel, being they ſtayed no where, for this reaſon, and the ſeaſon being paſſed,<note place="margin">Go into Winter Quarters;</note> he reſolved to ſend his Army into Winter-Quarters.</p>
                  <p>The ſucceſſes of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> laſt year in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> which we have already mentioned, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them with their General <hi>Kunincky,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Spring, to go in queſt of new Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, and being reinforced with <hi>Moldavians</hi> and <hi>Walachians,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Stravico,</hi> where the <hi>Danube</hi> diſgorges it ſelf into the black Sea, but being aſſailed by the <hi>Hoſpodar Duka,</hi> they were obliged to retire, and their General fled out of the Field with the Horſe, but the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry ſtanding firm, recovered the day, routed the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> took <hi>Jas,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire had been in no ſmall diſtraction before the relief of <hi>Buda,</hi> and that ſeeming in ſome ſort to compenſate their loſs at <hi>Vienna,</hi>

It had been given out that the Grand Seignior himſelf would in Perſon come into the field, at leaſt to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> to countenanee his Armies, though he was pleaſed to remain at <hi>Adrianople;</hi> and being the Forces he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered from the ſeveral Provinces of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were defective in the numbers he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he cauſed ſeveral of their Leaders to be ſtrangled. The Troops of <hi>Aſia</hi> did likewiſe mutiny, which ſo retarded his preparations, that the Chriſtians got into the Field before him, and neceſſitated him to a defenſive War. The Rendezvouz of his Forces was at <hi>Belgrade,</hi> from whence they paſſed by the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> to <hi>Buda,</hi> whoſe fortifications they took care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, for fear leſt the Enemy might attempt a ſecond Siege, placing twelve thouſand men there in Garriſon, with Victuals and Ammunition for its defence.

                     <hi>Newheuſel</hi> had been block'd up all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the Chriſtians, under the command of Collonel <hi>Heuſler,</hi> ſo that moſt of the attempts for its relief from <hi>Buda, Agria,</hi> and other of their Garriſons, proved fruitleſs. The Turks ſeeing no good to be done with ſmall Detachmnts, drew a great Body of Men together, betwixt <hi>Peſt</hi> and <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> and having provided a great Convoy of Proviſions, reſolved to attempt the relief of the place, which occaſioned Collonel <hi>Heuſler</hi> to be daily re-inforced with new Troops; who, ten thouſand ſtrong, poſted his Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the River <hi>Gran,</hi> having taken care to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure all the Fords and paſſages of it.

                  <p>The Chriſtian Army, compoſed of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Troops, and their ſeveral Allies, being much more forward than the Turks, had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouzed, and were now encamped betwixt <hi>Newheuſel</hi> and <hi>Barcam,</hi> where, upon the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s arrival, it was reſolved at a Council of War to attack <hi>Novigrade,</hi> to cut off by that means the communication betwixt <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> and afterwards formally to beſiege <hi>Newheuſel.</hi> But he afterwards altered his mind, being it might take up too much time to beſiege <hi>Novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> by reaſon of the diſtance, and would but little contribute to the Siege of <hi>Newheuſel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this laſt place was repreſented very defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, through their wants and diſtempers.</p>

                     <hi>Newheuſel</hi> the <hi>Oywar</hi> of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> is a large Hexagon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Newheuſel</hi> beſieged by the Chriſtians.</note> well bulwork'd and moated, the Plain about being Mooriſh and Fenny. The River <hi>Newtra</hi> runs within Piſtol-ſhot of it, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing the Town-Ditch with its Water, by a cut or trench, which conveys it into it. The reſolution of attacking this important place being taken,<note place="margin">Jul. 7th.</note> it was inveſted by the Imperial Army, the lines of Circumvallation were made, and a reſolution was taken to attack the place with vigour and conduct. Two lines of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were advanced towards two Baſtions; that to the right by the Imperialiſts, and they of <hi>Lunebourg;</hi> and the other by the Imperialiſts, and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops; the one commanded by the Princes of <hi>Hanovre,</hi> and <hi>Croy,</hi> byturns, and the other by Count <hi>Serini,</hi> with each three Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Generals to aſſiſt them. The ſame night the Trenches were opened by three thouſand Foot, and the Approaches carried on ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred paces. Thoſe on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide towards the <hi>Moſque</hi> were enlarged and deepened, ſo that three Men might paſs a-breſt, and be covered. On the Imperialiſts ſide, the Duke cauſed two Batteries to be raiſed, both on the right of his Approaches, whereon they worked the whole Night; and though the Enemy continued to ſhoot their Cannon without ceaſing, there were but very few killed or wounded. In ſhort, the Approaches on both ſides were carried on with ſuch care, and induſtry, and courage, the Duke ſeldom leaving the Trenches till very far in the Night, but aſſiſting and encouraging the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery by his preſence and authority, that maugre all the brave oppoſition of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and their perpetual firing and ſallies, the works were continued to the very Mote on both ſides, ſtrengthned not only with Lines of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, with Redoubts, and with multiplied Batteries, but the Water alſo began to be drained out of the Ditch, by a Canal made for the purpoſe. The Beſieged ſeeing themſelves ſo ſorely preſſed, amongſt others made a Sally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three a Clock, with two hundred Men, and ſurpriſed a Redoubt, wherein there were three hundred of the <hi>Suabian</hi> Troops, who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their Officers were all cut to pieces. The Turks were ſo joyed with this ſucceſs, that they teſtified it by a conſort of Muſick, after their mode, that Night. The Beſiegers had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to paſs the Ditch in Boats, and ſo carry over their Minery, but the ſaid Boats were ſunk by the Defendants, and many ſlain; and now they begin to fill the ſaid Moat with Faggots, and Sacks of Wool, and ſeveral Galleries were in making for the ſecurer paſſage, but they were often burnt and broke by the Beſieged, who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted nothing in their defence. They ſet fire on the <hi>Bavarians</hi> Gallery with their Arrows, at the ſharp ends whereof they had faſtned a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sulphur and Pitch, which did not only burn it, but communicating its flames to the neighbouring Battery, burnt it quite down, with the Carriages of four of their battering Pieces, notwithſtanding all the diligence and care to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>It was now the beginning of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> when the Beſieged made a brisk Sally upon them that worked in the advanced Poſts over againſt the Gate of <hi>Gran,</hi> killed fifty and hurt many, among which was <hi>Gallenfels</hi> Lieutenant Collonel, <hi>Puge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relli</hi> a Captain, and ſeveral other Officers. The diſorder was ſo great, that the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Lorrain</hi> ran thither, the latter wounding ſorne of the Run-aways to ſtay them, and ill treating their Officers for their negligence. Collonel <hi>Burgſtorf</hi> was killed the Night following in the Approaches, and Count <hi>Souches</hi> dangerouſly wounded in his Neck. The Beſieged had filled up the Canal which the Chriſtians had made to drain their Moat, but it was opened again. And now the Approaches, the Galleries, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Ditch had been carried on with ſuch violence, that the Cannon of the Town were well-nigh all diſmounted, and the infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Bombs and Carkaſſes which had been thrown into it, had well-nigh conſumed it. The Beſieged had indeed made new Retrenchments in the attack'd Baſtions, where they had re-moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:39539:153"/>their Cannon, and uſed them with ſucceſs: but,</p>
                  <p>The Breach which the Chriſtians had made was great, and the Gallery was carried over. The Moat was filled equal with the largeneſs of the Breach, and the Mines were a compleating, the Traverſes of the Ditch were much enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo that the Souldiers might go in a large front to the aſſault. And yet they finiſh another Battery upon the brink of the Moat, where they planted twenty-four Pieces of Cannon of twenty four pound Ball, to make the Breach yet larger and eaſier. And now all things being prepared for the aſſault, they were hindred for two or three days by the great Rains.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of this Month, the Baſſa had deſired a Parley, but demanded, in caſe of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, that he might march away, not only with their Arms, but all ſorts of Ammunition and Cannon, and take with him all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Slaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which conditions the Duke would not hearken to. The Baſſa was indeed animated by hopes of relief from the <hi>Seraskier,</hi> who, he knew, was preparing for it, and had already in order to a diverſion beſieged <hi>Gran,</hi> which obliged the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and forty thouſand men, to riſe and go and meet him, leaving eleven thouſand Foot and five thouſand Horſe, with fifty-eight Pieces of Cannon, and eighteen Mortars, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Siege under the command of Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> Marſhal General of the Field, and the Prince of <hi>Croy,</hi> General of the Artillery.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> the fatal <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> being come, a reſolution was taken to aſſault the Town at Eleven of the Clock, to which end two Mines were ſprung that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, one at the North Baſtion, and the other up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the neighbouring Curtain, which, though they had not their wiſhed effect, which was to ruine ſome retrenchments of the beſieged, yet they did much facilitate the paſſage, rendering the aſcent more eaſie, ſo that it was reſolved to aſſault the place at eight a clock, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe three thouſand were ordered for the attack in two places, to each fifteen hundred, which were ſupported by a Reſerve of two thouſand.

Count <hi>Sherffenberg</hi> commanded the right, being followed by them of <hi>Lunenberg</hi> and <hi>Suabia,</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Samoraski</hi> the left, with the Troops of <hi>Colen, Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Franconia.</hi> Being thus prepared, they fired from all their Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſhowred in their Granado's and Bombs from nineteen Mortars, with that impetuouſneſs, that they put them within into ſuch a conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that for ſome time they durſt ſcarce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. During this Tempeſt, Count <hi>Sherffenberg</hi> firſt enter'd, and poſting himſelf upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, the Sieur <hi>Rummel</hi> about the ſame, puſhing at the new breach; the beſieged were forced to give way on all ſides, and retreating upon a Cavalier of their Retrenchments, did now the ſecond time lift up a white Flagg, demanding quarter, but in vain; for the Chriſtians ruſhing on, put all they met to the Sword; this rendred the reſt ſo deſperate, that four hundred of them precipitated themſelves into the Town-Ditch, who were all deſtroyed by the Horſe, ſo that of all the Garriſon which was yet twelve hundred at the beginning of the aſſault, ſcarce two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were ſaved. <hi>Haſſan</hi> Baſſa the Governour, deſperately wounded in the head and breaſt, was brought to the General, and ſome ten more of the chief Officers were ſaved; but the Governor dyed two days after of his wounds.<note place="margin">Is taken by Aſſault.</note> This <hi>Haſſan</hi> was a Renegade, Native of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> though a man of extraordinary great parts and reſolution.</p>
                  <p>There were found in the place eighty Pieces of Ordnance, and a great quantity of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Proviſion, ſo that the perpetual noiſe of their wants was a fable, the Governour having always a great Magazin of Victuals, as well as Ammunition, which he did not think fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe before the Siege. Of the Chriſtian Slaves there were but forty remaining, the Turks ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſumed the reſt in their works, expoſing them ſtill where the greateſt danger was. And although the Beſiegers did ſcarce loſe one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the ſtorm, yet it is ſuppoſed, that during the whole Siege, the number of their ſlain did at leaſt equal, if not ſurmount that of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet with this difference, that the Turks loſt all, and they but an inconſiderable part of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Army: excepting the Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> greatly lamented by the good and brave, and ſome other conſiderable Officers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Seraskier,</hi> not imagining the fate of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heuſel</hi> ſo near, having with great induſtry ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a conſiderable Army, eſtimated betwixt fifty and ſixty thouſand ſtrong, reſoved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the relief of it, in order to which he would try the way of diverſion,<note place="margin">Jul. 30.</note> as leſs hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous, and upon that account marches to <hi>Gran,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gran</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> and though that very day of his arrival an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional reinforcement of five hundred men, ſent thither by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> got into the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, yet he cauſed the Trenches to be opened, and began to attack the place with his Cannon and Mortars, from Batteries raiſed on St.<hi>George</hi> and St.<hi>Thomas</hi> hills. They alſo attackt the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Town, but were repulſed with the loſs of two or three hundred men. Several other attempts were made upon the Out-works, but with loſs to the Undertakers, who underſtanding that the Enemy advanced, grew more remiſs, poſſeſſing themſelves of all the Hills by which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might attack them, and thereupon quitted the Siege.</p>
                  <p>On the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with forty thouſand men, paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Bridge near <hi>Comorra,</hi> and arrived the <hi>12th</hi> at a Village that was burnt, where he found the Turks, who had abandoned the Siege of <hi>Gran,</hi> very advantageouſly poſted, having Mountains on each ſide, covered with thick Woods, and a Moraſs before them, which reached to the <hi>Danube.</hi> Upon the arrival of the Chriſtian Army, they skirmiſhed near the Moraſs, where ſeveral were killed and hurt on both ſides. The following Night the Chriſtian Army camped in Battalia, and continued ſo the <hi>13th,</hi> but the Turks alarm'd them about noon, and skirmiſhed all the day with the Chriſtians right Wing, where the <hi>Hungarians</hi> were, many being ſlain and wounded on both ſides. About noon the Duke comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome Pieces of Cannon to be planted on a Hill behind his Men, from whence they ſhot, and the Turks did the ſame with two great Pieces, from a height where the Janizaries were. The <hi>14th,</hi> the Turks advanced their Camp to the very Moraſs, upon Mountains oppoſite to our advanced Guards, where they made three Batteries with great Cannon, ſhooting into our very Camp.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>15th,</hi> a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Slave eſcaped out of the Turkiſh Camp, and gave advice, that the <hi>Seras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kier, Ibrahim</hi> Baſſa, was perſwaded, that the Chriſtian Army did not exceed twenty thouſand, and thought or a retreat, ſo that he might eaſily rout them, if he ſuddenly fell upon them with his that was ſixty thouſand ſtrong. Upon this advice, the Duke and the other Generals reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to feign a Retreat, and then, by drawing
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:39539:154"/>the Enemy beyond the Moraſs, find a place to fight with them in a pitch'd Battel.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the Turks advanced towards a place in the Moraſs where they might paſs with the Horſe, and took Poſt alſo in another, where they might make a Bridge for the Foot. As the Chriſtians had already reſolved to march the day following very early, towards the Bridge of Boats at <hi>Vyfali,</hi> they let flie ſome Guns only to amuſe the Enemy. In the mean time the Orders for the march of the Army were given in the following manner. Firſt, that the Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage ſhould part that evening. The left Wing having the Avaunt-Guard, followed by that of the right. Secondly, that the Army ſhould be ranged in Battalia before day, and march as the place would permit; the two Wings each in two Lines, but if the way would oblige them to file, that then they ſhould begin by the left Wing, and enlarge themſelves as the ground did permit, into their firſt order of Battel.</p>
                  <p>That the ſecond line ſhould have the Avaunt-Guard commanded by Count <hi>Dunewalt,</hi> which was to be followed by the firſt line in the ſame manner. At the right of the firſt line Count <hi>Styrum</hi> was to march upon the Mountains (which he had viewed the day before) with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Dragoons of <hi>Luneburg,</hi> and all the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> except thoſe of <hi>Zoborra,</hi> with ſome Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces. That the <hi>Fauconets</hi> ſhould march before the firſt line, and every Regiment with its Field<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces, as uſual. And finally, that the Squadrons and the Battalions poſted on the little Mountain on this ſide the Moraſs, as alſo thoſe on the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the right, commanded by Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Tungen,</hi> ſhould march at the ſound of the Tymbals.</p>
                  <p>About ten at Night they had News that the Turks were paſſing the Moraſs,<note place="margin">The Battel of <hi>Gran. Aug.</hi> 15.</note> whereupon all the Generals took Horſe, <hi>Lorrain</hi> in the right, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> in the left, and all being in order, they began to march at the ſound of their Trumpets, Tymbals, and Drums, which was continued till the Turks by Favour of the Night charged their left Wing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the whole Army facing about, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to ſuccour their engaged Troops, which done, they continued advancing, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cries and howlings of the Turks, and their continual Skirmiſhing till it was break of day, when a great Miſt covered the whole Field, that nothing could be diſcerned. Both ſides made uſe of this accident, ranging their Armies to their uttermoſt Advantage.</p>
                  <p>After ſeven in the Morning, the Sun having diſpell'd the Miſt, the Turks advanced upon the Chriſtians, with the noiſe of their Drums and horrible Cries, diſcharging ſome Cannon upon their right Wing, charged it with great fury, but they were repulſed; the ſame happended on the Mountain where <hi>Tungen</hi> commanded, who was hurt there. At the ſame time the Turks attacked with their greateſt force, and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their Foot, the heights on the Chriſtians right where Count <hi>Styrum</hi> was, but he was ſo ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuccoured by ſome Imperial Battalions and other Troops of the ſecond line, that the Turks were forced to retire, being indeed chaſed and repelled in all the parts of the Army. Being fled by the Moraſs, the way they came, they ſeemed to make head again in their Camp, but upon the advance of the Chriſtians, who paſſed the Moraſs with their Foot and Horſe, the terror and conſternation was ſo great amongſt the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh Souldiers,<note place="margin">Gained by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</note> that it was impoſſible for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſquier, notwithſtanding all his endeavour to perſwade his Men to oppoſe the paſſage of the Moraſs. They alſo abandoned their Camp, Arms, Cannon, and other Inſtruments of War to the Purſuers, beſides forty Enſigns and ſome two hundred Priſoners which were taken. The Seraſquier was hurt in his Leg, and having left five thouſand upon the place, ſecured the reſt by a timely retreat. The two Armies ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after the fight, the Chriſtians went back to <hi>Comorra,</hi> in order to their proſecution of the Siege of <hi>Newheuſel:</hi> and the Seraſquier having rallied his Forces, and puniſhed with ſtrangling ſome of his chief Officers, who had not well behaved themſelves in the Battel of <hi>Gran,</hi> and paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> declaring he would relieve <hi>Newheuſel</hi> whatever it coſt, but ſoon after he received the news, as the Chriſtians had at <hi>Comorra,</hi> that the place was taken by aſſault.</p>
                  <p>The Seraſquier however having formed a new train of Artillery of twenty Pieces, which he took out of <hi>Buda,</hi> and being re-inforced with ſeveral freſh Troops, he marched towards <hi>Vac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> incamping betwixt that place and <hi>Pest,</hi> but hearing of the approach of the Chriſtian Army, he abandoned <hi>Novigrade</hi> and <hi>Vaccia,</hi> taking the Cannon and Ammunition with him that was there, demoliſhing the ſaid places, and ſetting fire to them when he left them. He alſo ruined the Country about <hi>Peſt,</hi> and having ſent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to re-inforce the Garriſon of <hi>Agria,</hi> he repaſſed the <hi>Dunube</hi> with the reſt of his Army at <hi>Buda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now the Turks do not ſeem averſe from Peace, the Seraſquier having ſent an Aga to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> with a Letter, wherein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his Highneſs, that he had full power from the Grand Seignior to treat and conclude a Peace, which he conjures him to promote by offers of great advantage, as abandoning Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> and delivering of the three Hoſtages, which were in the Grand Seignior's hands. But the Duke anſwered him, that he had no Orders to treat of Peace, and that a Victorious Army was not to be amuſed with ſuch Propoſals, but that he would acquaint his Imperial Majeſty with the Seraſquier's deſire.</p>
                  <p>The Seraſquier having paſſed the <hi>Danube,</hi> the few Tartars he had, not exceeding ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, left him and returned home. The Baſſa's of <hi>Agria, Temiſwar</hi> and <hi>Waradin</hi> were ſent back, with the Troops under their command, and went home to their reſpective Governments, the Seraſquier with the reſt of his Army poſting himſelf betwixt <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Alba-Regalis</hi> to obſerve the Chriſtians motion.</p>
                  <p>The Imperial Army had advanced in queſt of the Turks as far as <hi>Vaccia,</hi> but hearing that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army was ſeparated in ſeveral Bodies, and marched as above, as alſo towards the Frontiers of <hi>Styria</hi> and <hi>Croatia;</hi> the Duke reſolved likewiſe to ſend four thouſand men to re-inforce Count <hi>Leſley,</hi> and being the Forrage was deſtroyed, to return, having ordered a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of five Regiments of Foot, one of Cuiraſiers, and two of Dragoons and Croats, to march unto uppper <hi>Hungary,</hi> where Count <hi>Caprara</hi> was to command in Chief.</p>
                  <p>The Seraſquier had made ſeveral other At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for Peace, but the Emperour refuſing paſports to his Aga, thoſe overtures vaniſhed. There had alſo been an <hi>Armenian</hi> ſent in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this year with overtures of Peace, but he was ſent back with this Anſwer; That the Emperour will not enter into any Negotiation of Peace, but joyntly with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> inſomuch that finding all his Endeavours for a Treaty fruitleſs, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> ſending part of his
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:39539:154"/>Forces towards <hi>Zigeth,</hi> and the reſt towards <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia</hi> and <hi>Boſoria,</hi> whereby he alſo defeated Count <hi>Leſleys</hi> Deſign upon <hi>Poſſega.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To all the Miſeries of War was added that of the Plague, which raged much at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which, together with the accompt they had of the loſs of <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> and the other ill Succeſſes of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army in <hi>Hungary, Morea,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every where, had filled not only that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but the Empire with Conſternation and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult; for the Janizaries, as is uſual in all great Misfortunes, mutined, threathed not only the Grand Viſier, but the Grand Seignior himſelf, and were not to be appeaſed without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Diſtributions amongſt them; it being alſo given out, that his Highneſs would himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Army in Perſon next Summer.</p>
                  <p>The Principal Armies of theſe potent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries being in Winter Quarters, we will leave them ſtrugling there to enlarge their Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations, and transfer our Pen to ſuch Actions as have been remarkable in other Parts.</p>
                  <p>The Conteſts in upper <hi>Hungary</hi> were various betwixt the Imperialiſts and <hi>Tekelites,</hi> General <hi>Schultz</hi> commanded the former, who had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to attack <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngwar,</hi> and afterwards to beſiege <hi>Eſperies</hi> and <hi>Caſſaw.</hi> Count <hi>Tekely</hi> thereupon paſſes the <hi>Tybiſcus,</hi> aſſembling what Troops he could together, ſending to the Neighbour Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries to cauſe their Militia to march and to joyn him, which <hi>Schultz</hi> endeavoured to hinder, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially his joyning againſt the Turks. And now he lays cloſe Siege to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngwar,</hi> which was defended with no leſs Valour than Obſtinacy, inſomuch that after the loſs of ſeveral Officers, and a conſiderable number of Men, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to raiſe the Siege. Some time after he laid ſiege to the City of <hi>Eſperies</hi> with eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, where he found no leſs Oppoſition than at <hi>

All was crowded with Rice, Flower, Bread, Biſquet, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as alſo Barley, Oats, and Forrage in abundance, enough to furniſh an Army. As ſoon as they were Maſter of the City, they placed a Guard againſt the Caſtle, whilſt the General went to ſee the Bridge, the like whereof is not in the World. On this ſide the <hi>Drave</hi> from <hi>Eſſeck</hi> to the ſaid River, it is about eleven hundred paces long, and on the other ſide more than eight thouſand, all of Oak Wood. It is twelve paces broad. The Drave is not large in this place, the Bridge being ſupported by only ſixteen Boats. The Turks brake it the preceeding day, letting the materials vogue with the ſtream into the <hi>Danube.</hi> Count <hi>Leſley</hi> cauſed thirteen fair Mills upon the Drave to be burnt, and having in vain attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to burn the Bridge on the other ſide, conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that on this with Fire in few hours. The Imperialiſts knowing that the Inhabitants had ſaved their beſt goods in the Caſtle, they would alſo attempt that, but having loſt ſeveral Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and other Officers, they deſiſted, and <hi>Leſley</hi> returned back to his Camp at <hi>Turanowitz.</hi>

                     </note> at leaſt Equality, by the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans,</hi> who, together with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> made perpetual Incurſions into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain,</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining Provinces, burning and ravaging the Villages and Countrey, carrying the alarm to the very Gates of <hi>Leopol.</hi> Nor were the <hi>Poles</hi> forward in their Proparations, moving but very ſlowly to their general Rendezvous, ſo that the King not going to the Field in Perſon, it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry late in the year before they were come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, however, entertained in the mean time with a very ſad account from <hi>Podolia, Volinia,</hi> and the leſſer <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> of the miſerable Devaſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe Countries by the continued Incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Infidels.</p>
                  <p>The Grand Seignior had appointed <hi>Solyman</hi> Baſſa, now Seraskier, to command his Army againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> which he endeavoured to raiſe and form with all imaginable Induſtry, being ſollicitous for <hi>Caminiec,</hi> which he took care by reiterated Convoys, though ſome ſometimes miſcarried, to provide for. He hearing of the Chriſtians advance towards the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> the <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> being joyned with him, and both near forty thouſand ſtrong, poſted himſelf near the River to hinder the <hi>Poles</hi> from paſſing it.</p>
                  <p>And now the Armies drawing near, it was ſuppoſed they would not ſeparate without a Battel. The <hi>Poles</hi> paſſed the <hi>Nieſter</hi> with theirs, conſiſting of betwixt twenty and thirty thouſand men, on a Bridge they had made for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, advanced into <hi>Moldavia,</hi> where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped; and now the whole Army being come up, the Crown General having ſummoned a Council of War, it was determined to go and find the Enemy, and force him to fight. The Army marched accordingly, and were three days paſſing the Woods and Streights of <hi>Bouco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſia</hi> without any Intelligence of the Enemy. Being come into a Plain, their Van-Guard was preſently charged by a Body of <hi>Tartars.</hi> Ten Troops of Horſe were ſent to ſupport the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, but being over-power'd, were forced to give way. The Prince of <hi>Courland</hi> advancing with three Battalions, and ſome Field-pieces, gave the Chriſtians Opportunity to rally, and returning to the charge, obliged the <hi>Tartars</hi> to retire to the Hill from whence they came. The next Morning the two Armies ſtood in view of each other, only ſome ſlight Skirmiſhes paſſing betwixt them. The third, the <hi>Seraskier</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall upon the Enemies right Wing with his main force, charged it briskly, but finding it ſtrengthned from the main body, retired and fell upon the main body it ſelf, but with the like ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The <hi>Poles</hi> left Wing was charged by the <hi>Tartars</hi> with ſome advantage at firſt, but in the Concluſion were forced to retire. That day the Turks had been incommoded by the oppoſite Artillery, compoſed of thirty pieces of Ordnance, and the following day, having received Cannon from <hi>Camineck,</hi> they repayed them in kind. The Chriſtians continued encamped the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days, ſecuring themſelves with Trenches and Redoubts. On the ninth day, the Chriſtian General being informed that a great Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſent to fall in the rear of the Army, and ſhut up the Paſſages of the Forreſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to retire; and that he might do it with leſs trouble, he cauſed all their Waggons that were not abſolutely neceſſary, to be burnt. It was next Morning before the Turks were aware of their march, when, deſcending into the Plain, they charged three Battalions of foot which had not yet entered the Wood, but they being well covered with turn Pikes, and each two Field-pieces, they received the Enemy with ſo great a Fire, that they forced them to retire. And yet they eſcaped by their Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution the danger that threatned them, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their Paſſage back to the <hi>Nieſter</hi> by a very orderly retreat, which they likewiſe paſſed, tho' the Turks were much ſtronger than they, and ſo were diſperſed into their Winter Quarters.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the Turks very unſuccesful in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia.</hi> The Chriſtians had beſieged <hi>Singn,</hi> but were forced to retire by the joynt Forces of the Turks in thoſe quarters with loſs of ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of their men, two pieces of Cannon, and moſt of their Baggage. But the Wars being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defenſive in thoſe parts, on both ſides, than otherwiſe, nothing of any very great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, beſides Incurſions and mutual Ravages, worthy of Memory did happen.</p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:39539:155"/>
                  <p>The traverſes at Sea were of more noiſe and conſequence. The Turkiſh Fleet was affirmed to conſiſt of ſixty Gallies, and twenty men of War, who were at Sea, though ſuppoſed not well manned. On the other ſide, the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet was ſtronger, full of Sea-men, beſides thirteen thouſand Land-Forces of ſeveral Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all commanded by their General <hi>Moroſini,</hi> who ſailing for the <hi>Levant,</hi> landed his Forces in the <hi>Morea,</hi> at the Fortreſs of <hi>Calamata,</hi> which he took, and afterwards ſate down before <hi>Coron,</hi> where, having made large Breaches, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely annoyed the place with their Bombs, the Baſſa hung out a white Flag, but all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, except ſurrendring upon diſcretion, being refuſed him, he put out a black Colours, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating he would defend it to extremity, which he alſo did.</p>
                  <p>The Baſſa of <hi>Petraſſo</hi> marched with eight thouſand Men to his relief, but upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſtrength of the Chriſtians, he durſt not attempt it; but contenting himſelf to re-inforce the Garriſon of <hi>Modon,</hi> and with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon the <hi>Greeks</hi> (that avoured the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>) he made a great ſlaughter of them. The Viſier of <hi>Morea, Kalil</hi> Baſſa, having got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a competent Army of near ten thouſand, would re-attempt the relief of <hi>Coron;</hi> in order to which, he ſent a Party to attack a Redoubt ſomewhat diſtant from the Line of the Beſiegers, but were repulſed, but aſſaulting it again, they took it at the ſecond ſtorm. Hereupon the Chevalier <hi>de la Tour,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither with twelve hundred Men, recovered it from the Turks, with the loſs of his own life, and many of his Men. A while after, the <hi>Viſier</hi> made an attempt upon the main Camp, but was beaten off with mutual loſs. In the mean time, the Chriſtian General finding the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Turks troubleſome, and foreſeeing that his Troops would not be able to ſubſiſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had the Country open, reſolved to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt their removal; in order to which, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten Men out of a Company, to which were joyned fifteen hundred Voluntiers, with one of the Regiments of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and that of <hi>Malta,</hi> they, marching before day, ſurpriſed, and fell upon the Enemy on all ſides; the action was ſo ſudden, that the Turks before they could recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect themſelves were driven out of their ſeveral Poſts, purſued, and quite diſperſed. Of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy there were near a thouſand killed in the action and purſuit, of which number was the Viſier <hi>Kalil</hi> and <hi>Mehemet</hi> Baſſa. All their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Baggage were taken, with nine pieces of braſs Cannon, ſeventeen Colours, and the great Standard, with three Horſe-tayles hanging at it. This Victory was ſome days after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted by the taking of <hi>Coron,</hi> where the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, forcing the way into the Town, through their very large Breaches,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>11.</hi>
                     </note> put all they met to the Sword. There were above three thouſand of the Turks ſlain in this ſtorm, and four or five hundred of the Chriſtians, among which were two Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> Prince <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> the Marquiſs of <hi>Courbon</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> beſides thirty Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> with ſeveral other Perſons of Quality wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There were ſeventy-ſix Pieces of Braſs Cannon, beſides great ſtore of Ammunition and Proviſion, with Plunder, reckoned at above two Millions, found in this place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Succeſſes encouraged the Greeks to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the Province of <hi>Maina</hi> being alſo diſpoſed to caſt off the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Yoak, were greatly encouraged to it by <hi>Moroſini,</hi> who ſending a Detachment with ſuch <hi>Maynots</hi> as were entred into the Service of the Re-publick, gave them orders to attack <hi>Zarnata,</hi> a Fortreſs built to keep that People in awe. In the mean time the Chriſtian Fleet ſailed towards <hi>Calamata,</hi> near which place the Forces landed.</p>
                  <p>The Captain Baſſa, hearing of the ill ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Country-men in <hi>Morea,</hi> came with his Fleet to <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> where ſecuring the Ports with great Chains, he landed what Men he poſſibly could, and joyning with a great Body of. Horſe and Foot, he marched towards <hi>Calamata,</hi> to keep the <hi>Mainotes</hi> from revolting to the <hi>Ventains. Zarnata</hi> had been threatned into ſurrender, ſix hundred Men that garriſoned it marching out with their Arms and Baggage, though the Aga that commanded it, diſtruſting his conduct, ſtayed in the Chriſtian Camp.</p>
                  <p>The Captain Baſſa being advanced, <hi>Moroſini</hi> being re-inforced with three thouſand <hi>Saxons</hi> reſolved to fight him. Being met, the Turkiſh Horſe fell upon the Chriſtians left Wing, and at the ſame time a great Body of their Foot advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced towards their right; but found ſuch brave reſiſtance, that they were forced to retire. They returned to the charge again, but with the ſame ſucceſs, and being preſſed, fell into diſorder and were defeated; though the loſs was not very great on either ſide. The Garriſon of <hi>Calamata</hi> hearing of this rout, fired their Magazin and quitted the place, leaving eleven Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non behind them, which was immediately gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned by the victorious. The <hi>Maynotes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon beſieged <hi>Porto Vitulo,</hi> the which with <hi>Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifa</hi> and <hi>Paſſavia</hi> are the only places of ſtrength that the Turks poſſeſs in that great Province, but theſe likewiſe, as alſo <hi>Porto Vitulo,</hi> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Inhabitants to ſurrender, came all under the dominion of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> from whence, General <hi>Moroſini</hi> having put good Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into thoſe places, marched towards <hi>Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zino.</hi> But the ſeaſon being too far advanced, having razed <hi>Calamata</hi> and <hi>Paſſava,</hi> as not very defenſible, he diſperſed his Army into Winter Quarters, ſailing himſelf with his Gallies to <hi>Santa Maura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Fleet under the command of the Seigniors <hi>Molino</hi> and <hi>Delfino,</hi> had cruiſed the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> putting thoſe Iſlands under contribution, though no material action at Sea had paſſed betwixt the two Fleets of the Chriſtians and Turks.</p>
                  <p>The Captain Baſſa, after theſe misfortunes, ſhewed a great inclination to peace, ſignifying his deſire to ſet a Treaty on foot for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to which end he ſignified the ſame to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Moroſini</hi> by a particular Meſſenger,<note place="margin">Novem.</note> who referred him to his Superiours.</p>
                  <p>There had likewiſe been an Aga ſome time at <hi>Comorra,</hi> who declared, that the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior did deſire to re-eſtabliſh a Peace or Truce betwixt the two Empires,<note place="margin">Attempts for Peace prove fruitleſs.</note> deſiring that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners might be appointed on both ſides for that purpoſe; that he had ordered the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> to ceaſe from all Hoſtilities, and that he cauſed Count <hi>Tekely,</hi> the Author of the War, and the Evils that attended it, to be ſeized upon by his command. But all the anſwer he could get was, that the Emperour would enter into no Negotiation of Peace, without the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Allies. And yet ſome Propoſitions were obliquely made in their names. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour demanded reſtitution of all the Places that are poſſeſſed by the Turks in the Upper and Lower <hi>Hungary,</hi> and in <hi>Croatia.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> demanded <hi>Caminiec,</hi> and the whole Province of <hi>Podolia;</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> the whole Country of <hi>Morea,</hi> To conclude, the <hi>Aga</hi> was ſent back
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:39539:156"/>with this anſwer, That the Emperour and his Allies will receive no Propoſals, but ſuch as come immediately from the Grand Seignior himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartary</hi> had alſo offered the King of <hi>Poland</hi> his Mediation by an Embaſſy, and at the ſame time made Propoſals of Peace, but his Majeſty anſwered roundly, that he would hear of no Overtures of accomodation without his Allies, the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now all thoughts of quiet being laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, all the great Parties made all imaginable preparations,<note place="margin">Jan. <hi>1686.</hi>
                     </note> by Leagues, by Levies, by amaſſing of Moneys as well as Men for the future Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pain.</p>
                  <p>Thus ended this year 1685, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was no leſs active or turbulent. The Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialiſts, as a prelude to their future Succeſſes, beat a Party of the United Garriſons of the Turks, conſiſting of about ſix thouſand near <hi>Arach,</hi> which place they alſo took, with eleven Colours, and three Kettle Drums, beſides much ſpoil.</p>
                  <p>This ſucceſs was followed by others, St. <hi>Job</hi> being ſurrendred to Count <hi>Caraffa,</hi> the ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men which compoſed the Garriſon of it,<note place="margin">Feb. <hi>12.</hi>
                     </note> being conducted to great <hi>Waradin,</hi> and a Party from <hi>Comorra, Raab, Papa</hi> and <hi>Veſprin,</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Sehwar,</hi> betwixt <hi>Veſprin</hi> and <hi>Alba Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> which had much incommoded thoſe Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, upon as eaſie terms; the beſieged being only allowed what they could carry upon their backs.</p>
                  <p>Great were the diſorders and conſternation at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and throughout the whole <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">Diſorders at <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.

His eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the former Wars againſt the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his valorous defending of <hi>Buda</hi> in 1684 againſt the united powers of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, could not obtain his pardon, being he was likewiſe blamed for having diſcontented the Souldiers in defrauding them of their pay. Several other of the Chief Officers being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of not having done their duty at the Battel of <hi>Gran,</hi> were ſtrangled with him; and <hi>Solyman</hi> Baſſa, who had ſo ſucceſsfully commanded the Army laſt year againſt the <hi>Poles,</hi> was by the Grand Viſier recommended to the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior, as a Perſon very fit for that Employment in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which his Highneſs alſo approved of, but the Baſſa being ſurpriſed at the choice was made of him, ſenſible of the fate of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and the danger of the Employment, taking his opportunity, threw himſelf at the Grand Seignior's feet, and humbly prayed to be excuſed from ſo difficult a Province, being the Campaign would not probably end, under the circumſtances he was to undertake it, but with the loſs of his Head, which he would rather now ſacrifice at his Majeſtie's command, than dye hereafter in his diſpleaſure. The Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior wondering at what he heard, and that he ſhould ſcruple at ſo eminent a command, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his reaſons: He replied, that the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes of the laſt Campaign were occaſioned by the ill payment of the Troops, many other things of great importance to his ſervice having been likewiſe omitted, not obſcurely hinting at the Grand Viſier, he would notwithſtanding take the command upon him, if his Majeſty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the example of his Predeceſſours, would himſelf appear at the head of his Forces. The frankneſs of this diſcourſe wrought ſo much upon the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> that he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſent to the <hi>Viſier,</hi> who was, or pretended to be indiſpoſed, and conſequently kept his bed, to know, whether he was in a condition of health to attend him into <hi>Hungary,</hi> where he purpoſed to go himſelf? But the Viſier excuſing it, by reaſon of his indiſpoſition, his Majeſty ſent to him for his Seal, which being delivered, he immediately gave it to <hi>Solyman</hi> Baſſa, making him by that eminent mark of dignity Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> in the others room, who yet had his life granted him, and part of his Eſtate to ſubſiſt upon, being now in his Houſe on the <hi>Canal</hi> of the black Sea, near <hi>Scutary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Treaſure of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> was opened, Officers were ſent into all the extent of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and the utmoſt diligence was uſed to raiſe men, not only to recruit their ſhattered Armies, but to make new Levies, but with the uſual fate that attends unſucceſsful Arms.<note place="margin">The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Army Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz's at <hi>Barkam.</hi>

                  <p>The Forces being come together, the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the General Perſons that compoſed it were very differing.

Others would have <hi>Agria</hi> and <hi>Montgatz,</hi> the remains of <hi>Tekely</hi>'s rebellion in Upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> attempted, and the reſt were for marching directly to the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> for ſecuring that important paſſage, and then to beſiege <hi>Buda.</hi> Others were of opinion, that theſe three deſigns ſhould be enterpriſed at once, by dividing their Army into two parts, for the two firſt Enterpriſes, and that General <hi>Schults</hi> ſhould with the Army of <hi>Croatia</hi> attempt the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck.</hi> But they were very few that concluded poſitively for the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> which had already been abſolutely reſolved upon by the Emperour and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> upon a certainty that the taking of that place would vaſtly inlarge their Quarters, and a ſuppoſition (though not ſo well grounded) that all <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> would follow the fate of their Capital City.</p>
                  <p>But this deſign was kept very ſecret,<note place="margin">Jun. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> nor was it diſcovered until the arrival of Count <hi>Straat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Great Chancellor to the Emperour, who having in a Council of War prudently compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the punctilio's and differences between ſo many General Officers about their commands, to all their ſatisfactions; he ſhewed them the Emperour's Commiſſion and Orders to begin the Campaign with the Siege of <hi>Buda,</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to do their duty in an enterpriſe of ſuch great importance, whereon depended not only the conſervation of his Highneſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the ſecurity of his Crown, and the good of Chriſtendom, but alſo the ruine of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, being the loſs of this conſiderable place would be attended on with the ſurrender
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:39539:156"/>of the other Cities and Fortreſſes of <hi>Hungary,</hi> which would return to the Obedience of their natural Sovereign.</p>
                  <p>The Generals, who expected to begin with the Siege of <hi>Agria</hi> or <hi>Alb-Royal,</hi> were overjoy'd to underſtand that the deſign was upon <hi>Buda;</hi> and this News being ſpread amongſt the Officers and Souldiers of the Armies, they all teſtified their Satisfaction by their forwardneſs, and their deſire to ſee themſelves before a Place where they might ſignalize their Valour, and revenge the Death of their Comrades, who had been interred in the Trenches of the former Siege.</p>
                  <p>The Voluntiers, to the number of ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, of all Quality and Conditions, which were come thither out of <hi>Germany, France, England, Spain,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> to ſeek Honour in ſo pious a War, ſhewed much Ardour and Zeal to ſignalize themſelves in ſo glorious an undertaking.

But the Armies, to loſe no time, diſcamped on the twelfth of <hi>June</hi> by break of day, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> taking his way by the Bridge of <hi>Gran,</hi> had paſſed it the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, the Troops of <hi>Saxony</hi> having the Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> marched on this ſide the <hi>Danube</hi> to poſſeſs the City of <hi>Peſt.</hi> Whilſt the two Armies were thus marching on both ſides the River, Count <hi>Rabatta,</hi> who was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary General, had cauſed a prodigious quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Gabions and Fagots, which the Souldiers had made as they came to the general Randez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, to keep them from Idleneſs, to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark'd and ſent by Water towards <hi>Buda,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Artillery, Ammunitions, Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Forrage, and other neceſſary things for the ſubſiſtence of Armies. The next day the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies advanced, the great one near <hi>Vicegrade,</hi> and the other by <hi>Vaccia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fifteenth, the Imperial Horſe, followed by the Foot, and their Cannon and Baggage, paſſed <hi>Vicegrade;</hi> ſome Priſoners having been made by a party that the Duke had ſent to make Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries. Theſe unanimouſly declared, that they of <hi>Agria</hi> and <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> fearing a Siege had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuged all their beſt Moveables in <hi>Buda,</hi> and that this Capital City was, as well as the other Places, furniſhed with Troops and neceſſary Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſuſtain a long Siege, in expectation of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                  <p>Being come within an hour of the Town without any encounter, the Horſe made halt, as well to repoſe themſelves, as to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of their Infantry and Artillery, and now they begin to lay a Bridge of Boats at the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew</hi> for the Communication of the two ſides of the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the eighteenth, the Baron of <hi>Diependal,</hi> General <hi>de Battalia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Buda.</hi>
                     </note> inveſted the City of <hi>Buda,</hi> whilſt the Infantry were marching up, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up their Poſts half a League from the place, they began to break Ground, and work at their Line of Circumvallation. A great party of Horſe and Foot appeared out of the Garriſon at the <hi>Vienna</hi> Port, but they returned again upon the advance of a Detachment of Imperial Horſe, who had Orders to charge them, contented to welcome the Aſſailants with eight Volleys from their Cannon, though they kill'd but one Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer, by reaſon of the too great diſtance.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth, the Duke advanced with the Army as far as the hot Baths, the Turks having abandoned that Poſt the day before. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Quarters were taken up within a quarter of a League of the Town. The ſame day the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſeized upon the City of <hi>Peſt,</hi> which the Turks had quitted, retiring with their Cannon, Ammunitions and Proviſions into <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> after they had broken part of the Bridge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. The <hi>Croats,</hi> who ſcouted about the Country, took a Turkiſh <hi>Chiaux,</hi> with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of forty <hi>Spahis,</hi> who was ſent with Letters from the Port to the Viſier of <hi>Buda.</hi> Being brought to the Camp, his Letters were examined, which contained rigorous Orders to the Viſier, to be very careful of the Places which depended on his Government, and to aſſure him of a quick and powerful relief in caſe he were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd.</p>
                  <p>On the twentieth, the Bridge over the <hi>Danube</hi> was finiſhed. The ſame day a party of Horſe ſallied out of the Town with deſign to ſurpriſe the Chriſtians advanced Guard, but the Duke being advertiſed of it in time, ſent four ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, to which many Volunteers joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with orders to charge them; but they up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their approach retired without any engaging. The Artillery being arrived, two Batteries were raiſed againſt the lower Town, where the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> Attack was, and at Night the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were opened. A Janizary who deſerted, reported much after the ſame manner that the Priſoners already mentioned had done; that there were but eight thouſand men of formed Troops in the Town. The Viſier having ſome time before ſent two thouſand Souldiers to <hi>Agria,</hi> and as many to <hi>Alba-Regalis,</hi> upon a ſuppoſition that the Chriſtians would not think of beſieging <hi>Buda,</hi> which had been ſo fatal to them but two years ago. This Run-away affirmed further, that the Place was abundantly furniſhed with all manner of Proviſions and Ammunitions to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain a very long Siege, that the Viſier <hi>Abdi</hi> Baſſa was no great Warrior, and therefore the leſs conſidered by the Souldiery; that he had aſſembled all the Officers and Souldiers of the Garriſon together, had exhorted them to do their Duty, and to ſupport with Honour the Glory of the Turbant, adding, that he had Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the Grand Seignior to defend the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with his Life, which he was reſolved to do, and expect the Succours which the Grand Viſier would infallibly bring them. To this the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahis</hi> replyed, that they were ready to ſacrifice their. Lives in his Highneſs's Service, and for defence of their Laws, upon Condition however, that the Viſier would immediately give them ten Crowns a Man, that the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Officers that were detained in Priſon for what Crime ſoever ſhould be ſet at Liberty, and that he would not ſuffer things to come to the laſt extremity, leſt the ſame misfortune might happen to them, as did to thoſe of <hi>Newheuſel,</hi> all which the Viſier promiſed them to obſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly.</p>
                  <p>I muſt acknowledge I am entring into a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Narrative, and ſomewhat againſt my Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which affects lucid brevity; but the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of this Siege, perhaps circumſtantially the greateſt upon Record, full of ſuch ſtrange Events; of Emulation in the purſuit of Glory; of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temerity, and an invincible Reſolution on the one ſide; as alſo the Fidelity, the Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the unfortunate Valour of the other, hurries me on to a deſcription of it in all its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which I will do with that Candor, that the very indifferent Reader ſhall find nothing that may juſtly ſhock him, and the curious wherewith to content him.</p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:39539:157"/>
                  <p>The Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> having left a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at <hi>Peſt,</hi> and paſſed the Bridge of Boats at the Iſle of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> came with his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place, and took his Poſt in the ſame place where he had commanded in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Siege, that is, on the Caſtle ſide, and the upper Town, to form the ſecond attack, the third being reſerved for the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> who were expected in a few days, and were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced with the Troops of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Franco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> That Night the Turks fired mightily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them that worked in the Approaches and Batteries, whereof ſeveral were killed and hurt in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack.</p>
                  <p>The Duke ſent all the Imperial and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſe, under the command of the Generals <hi>Palfi, Gondola,</hi> and others, to camp in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> on purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Forrage, and keep that Garriſon in continual alarms, there remaining in the Camp but three thouſand Imperial and fifteen hundred <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſe to ſecure the Trenches and Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers. The Night paſſed, the Battery againſt the lower Town was brought to perfection, and twelve Pieces of Cannon mounted upon it, which played all the following day with the loſs of five men ſlain, and ſeveral wounded, from break of day the Cannon continued firing with ſuch ſucceſs, that they made a breach in the Wall of the lower Town, which was found to be twenty paces large. In the mean time the <hi>Bavarians</hi> on their ſide carried their Approaches on with great diligence, and had alſo ſome killed and wounded.</p>
                  <p>The day following, the breach being enlarged, was aſſaulted towards evening, the Walls being eaſily gained, for the Defendants retired into the upper Town after the firſt diſcharge. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians loſt a Captain of Foot, a Lieutenant of Granadiers, ſome Souldiers, and ſix Voluntiers in this attempt, beſides ſeven or eight hurt; and from that time they began to attack the Town in form, it being reſolved that the Trenches ſhould be relieved every day by a Lieutenant General, and a Major General, as well in the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s attack, as in the Elector's. The <hi>25th</hi> Count <hi>Souches</hi> and <hi>Diependal</hi> relieved the Trenches, but nothing was done beſides aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring the Lodgment upon the Wall of the lower Town, and opening the Gate which the Turks had ſhut up on the right, far enough from the breach where they took Poſt, and that the Labourers might be leſs incommoded, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Souches</hi> cauſed fire to be put in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Houſes, where ſome Fuſeliers did lurk, who were burnt with them. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the ſame day a little Battery upon St. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rards</hi> Hill, which the Turks had abandoned, from whence they threw ſome ſmall Bombs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City to try experiments. They alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed another great Battery to beat the great Rondel which joyns the Caſtle to the upper Town. The ſame day Count <hi>Budiani</hi> preſented ſome Standards to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> taken from a party of Turkiſh Horſe, which convoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fourteen or fifteen Barks loaden with the Wives and Children of the Officers of <hi>Buda,</hi> who retired with all their riches to <hi>Belgrade,</hi> and which his <hi>Heyduques</hi> and <hi>Huſſars,</hi> reinforced with ſome Imperial Dragoons, had ſurpriſed and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the Iſland of St. <hi>Margaret.</hi> The booty was great, and ninety-two Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren taken, amongſt which was the <hi>Viſier</hi> of <hi>Buda</hi>'s Wife.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>26th,</hi> they made ſeveral traverſe Lines, and laboured to compleat the Approaches to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Quarters in the lower Town, which was furniſhed with two thouſand Souldiers, and a good number of Pioneers. The Earth being rude and ſtony, did much obſtruct the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The great Maſter of the Teutonick Order, which commanded the Trenches, obſerving that the Pioneers in the lower Town might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily inſulted and beaten by the Beſieged, had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his demand ſix Battalions ſent him, which were poſted along the Wall to countenance them. Two fugitives, who ſaid they were <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians,</hi> rendered themſelves, and confirmed that the Garriſon was but eight thouſand Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, who by order of the Viſier had begun to untile the Houſes, and unpave the Streets, to hinder the effect of the Bombs. In the evening betwixt ſix and ſeven a Clock, the Turks fallied out with great Cries, to intimidate them who were poſted in the Rondel by the Water ſide, but they were ſo well received, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated confuſedly. Marſhal <hi>Starenberg</hi> haſtned thither ſeaſonably with two Battalions of them that had been poſted the day before behind the Wall, without which Succour the Turks would have made a great Slaughter amongſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers. The Enemy was purſued, and the Souldiers cut off ſome Heads, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Duke, who gave them a golden Ducket for each Head. A Captain was hurt in this ſcuffle, and ten or twelve Souldiers killed, and as many wounded.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Bavarians</hi> raiſed two Batteries for Bombs on the two ſides of their great Battery. They carried on their Trench above one hundred pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ran three traverſe Lines, with a place of Arms for the defence of their Battery. The Turks fired much with their Artillery, but kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led only two Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>27th,</hi> the Chriſtians compleated the works they had made in the Night, new tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes were made, ſome Musketiers were placed in the Moſque of the old Town, a Poſt was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken on the right near the Gate which makes the Angle of the Upper Town, the Lines were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and deepned, and the great Battery was well-nigh finiſhed, with the loſs only of one Man, and ſome few wounded. This Morning the Enemy appear'd where they had been yeſterday, ſeemingly diſpoſed to skirmiſh, but ſeeing that the Chriſtians were ready to receive them, they retired without attempting any thing. About Eleven a Clock they ſallied out, Horſe and Foot, with deſign to diſlodge the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers poſted on the right, but having ſtood a Volley, and ſeeing Count <hi>Hoffkirchen,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel to <hi>Dunewald,</hi> advancing with the Guards of Horſe, they returned into the City, leaving twenty of their men dead behind them. Of the Chriſtians there were but two killed, and five or ſix hurt. Another Deſerter came out of Town, who reported, that the Governour was greatly perplexed, in that he ſaw the inevitable fall of the City, which the Grand Seignior had committed to his charge, and that he loſt in the Sallies his beſt Souldiers, without being able to ruine the Enemies works; but that he reſented nothing equally with the captivity of his Wife, and thoſe of the Principal Officers of the Place, taken when they thought them paſt danger. In the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack they finiſhed a battery to play upon the Caſtle, and the Rondel that joyns it to the City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>28th,</hi> in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack, a Line of Communication four hundred paces long was drawn from the Poſt at the Angle on the right to the middle Gate, and another Line was made to go to the new battery, upon which they plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twelve pieces of Cannon. A little one was
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:39539:157"/>likewiſe in hand for four Mortars which were carried thither that Night, with ſome Cart loads of Bombs. The beſieged began to ſhoot Bombs and Stones out of Town. A Captain and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Souldiers were wounded that Night, and ſome killed. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> foreſeeing that Forrage would grow ſcarce in the Camp, ſent moſt of the baggage Horſes to the Meadows aſſigned them betwixt <hi>Gran</hi> and <hi>Newheuſel.</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Dunewald,</hi> who commanded the Horſe, camped near <hi>Alb-Royal,</hi> advertiſed the Duke, that the Turks having abandoned the Caſtle of <hi>Bathyan</hi> upon the River of <hi>Zarvis,</hi> he had put men into it, and that he was going to make a tentative upon <hi>Palotta,</hi> a place of good ſtrength near <hi>Alb-Royal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The twenty ninth, they continued to compleat their Works, and the Duke augmented the number of the Labourers with an addition of ſix hundred more. The beſieged made no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies theſe two days, but they plyed their Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery more furiouſly than ordinary to ruine the Chriſtians great Battery. About five a Clock they ſallied upon the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, with two thouſand Horſe and Foot, with ſo much Succeſs, that they put the Beſiegers into much diſorder, and the Janizaries leaping into the Approaches, were buſie in throwing of them down, when Count <hi>Hoffkirch</hi> flying thither with the Guard of Horſe from the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>'s Quarter, and the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Generals with their reſerves, the fight was rude on both ſides, till the Turks were forced to retreat, being purſued even to the Gates of their City, notwithſtanding the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fire from their Cannon and Muſquets from the Walls. Prince <hi>Eugenius</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> had his Horſe killed under him. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Generals <hi>Fontaine</hi> and <hi>la Vargne</hi> ſignalized themſelves in this Action, as alſo the Voluntiers, and particularly the Prince of <hi>Commercy. Switter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dael,</hi> a <hi>Bavarian</hi> Lieutenant-Collonel was ſlain, as alſo ſix Voluntiers, with thirty ſeven Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, beſides ſixty two wounded, one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, two Lieutenants, and an Enſign. The loſs on the Turks ſide was greater, being the Chriſtians brought away ſixty of their Heads, beſides what a fugitive <hi>Raſcian</hi> reported, that the Turks had had near two hundred kill'd and wounded. That Evening the four Mortars pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the great Battery began to play into the beſieged Works. Six Culverins were alſo plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the old Battery, wherewith they deſign'd to ſhoot into the Town Gate, to incommode the Sallies of the beſieged.</p>
                  <p>The thirtieth, the Troops of <hi>Suabia</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> arrived in the Camp, and took the Poſts deſigned for them; all the Night and Day were employed to advance the Works, which are ſo numerous, that they are ſcarce diſtinguiſhable. Count <hi>Souches,</hi> who commanded the Trenches that day, having ſent three Granadeers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the diſtance betwixt the Approaches and the Rondel, they brought word that it was no more than three hundred paces, and that the Turks were making a Ditch at the foot of the ſaid Rondel. Every Night great ſtore of Gabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Fagots, Munitions, and Proviſions, arrived in the Camp, by the care of the Commiſſary General, Count <hi>Rabatta.</hi> Count <hi>Caprara</hi> parted from the Camp with the <hi>Suabian</hi> Horſe, to joyn thoſe encamped near <hi>Alb-Royal,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the whole in chief. Five <hi>Raſcian</hi> Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, feeding their Sheep without under the Walls, ſlipt inſenſibly into the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with at leaſt four hundred, where they were well received and gratified. All they could ſay was, that the Conſternation was great amongſt the beſieged, who were yet reſolved to defend themſelves, in expectation of the Succours they were in hope for. They added, that the Bombs and Carcaſſes had fired the Town in ſeveral Places, though it had been luckily enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of <hi>July,</hi> Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> ſhewed General <hi>Schoning,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Braden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> Auxiliaries, and arrived in the Camp the Night before, the Approaches and the Attacks which were reſerved for his Troops, which was on the Water ſide on the left of the Imperialiſts, after which he was magnificently treated by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> from whence he went to joyn his Troops which were expected the next, or the following day. This Morning the Imperialiſts began to ſhoot out of their new Battery, out of four Pieces which ſhot twenty four pound Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets. The five Mortars by the great Battery continued to play upon the Rondel on the right, with ſuch Succeſs that the Defendants durſt not ſhew themſelves there. The Works were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating, and there were two Redoubts made to ſecure the Communication with the great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. This Night there were but five hurt, and one killed, and this Morning an Adjoutant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral was hurt in the Head with a Muſquet-ſhot, as he was carrying Orders into the Approaches. There hapned nothing in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Quarters, where they only continued their Labour and their Batteries, made a Breach in the outward Rampart. The reſt of the Troops of <hi>Franconia,</hi> conſiſting in fourteen hundred Foot, arrived there, who were placed near the reſt of the ſame Circle.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack advanced within two hundred Paces of the Walls of the City. The battery of twelve Guns of twenty four pound Balls was finiſhed, and four other Mortars that played without ceaſing all the laſt Night, fired the Town near the great Church, which laſted till Morning; the Cannon was plyed all this day againſt the two firſt Rondels, which are in a manner defenceleſs. Two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions more were ſent to reinforce thoſe who were camped under the Wall of the old Town. The beſieged threw again many Bombs and Stones, but with little prejudice to the Beſiegers, killing them not above three or four Souldiers. The Troops of <hi>Suaben</hi> began to work at their line of Circumvallation, and purpos'd the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Night to raiſe a Battery upon a height which they poſſeſs'd. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> thundred furiouſly againſt the Caſtle and upper Town, and had thrown many Bombs which had kindled a fire that was not yet extinguiſhed. The Duke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that the Turks might when it was dark, put, by the help of ſmall barks, Men, and Ammunition into the Town, went in Perſon to diſcover the ſuſpected Places about <hi>Peſt,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Prince of <hi>Savoys</hi> Regiment of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to poſt themſelves there, to aſſiſt the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> who were already there, and had Orders to raiſe ſome Sconces along the River ſide for their Security.</p>
                  <p>On the third of <hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Troops were ſeen to march on the other ſide of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went to viſit them, where he was received by General <hi>Schoning</hi> with a triple <hi>Salvo</hi> of all the Foot, ranged in battalia, with their Cannon at the head of the Infantry. His Highneſs was treated there with much Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and afterwards returned to his Quarters extremely ſatisfied to ſee ſuch a fine body of Men, ſo brisk, ſo well diſciplin'd, and provided with ſuch a good Train of Artillery. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts finiſhed another line for to defend their
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:39539:158"/>Approaches. They made ſuch great fire with their Cannon and Mortars, that they did not only make a notable breach in the Wall, but ruined alſo the batteries upon the two firſt Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, ſo that there was no more ſhooting thence. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> carried their lines to the very Caſtle, and made a new battery on the right towards the <hi>Danube,</hi> upon which they placed nine Mortars with ſucceſs. They ſhot alſo three days together from another battery of ſeven Demy-Cannon upon the Rondel; whilſt they play'd from another with four Guns upon the Flanks. They moreover worked at another of eight Cannon to batter the left of the Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. In the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack there were ſeven ſlain, and ſeveral hurt. Amongſt the reſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters, there was an Enſign of the Janizaries, who quitted the Town for having (as he ſaid) killed a Turkiſh Officer. He affirmed that there was but fifteen hundred real Janizaries in the place, but that counting the <hi>Spahi</hi>'s, Albamans, and other Troops, they amounted to ſeven thouſand Combatants; He added, that the Bombs and Carkaſſes had already ruined many buildings, and occaſioned a great loſs of Men and Cattel. He further ſaid, that the beſieged were buſie in making Mines behind the breach on the <hi>Lorrain</hi> ſide, and that no body had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto entered into the place. General <hi>Dunewald</hi> had deſiſted from his deſign upon <hi>Pallotta,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the place was provided with a good Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. The Turks there killed ſome of thoſe who were ſent to diſcover. Thoſe of <hi>Alb-Royal</hi> attacked and diſordered alſo ſome Foragers of Horſe quartered in their Neighbourhood, and amongſt others killed Count <hi>Papenheim,</hi> a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Horſe in the Troops of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 4th,</hi> The Approaches of the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack were run within one hundred paces of the breach in the Rondel to the right. The beſieged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to run a Line out of the ſaid breach, which they lengthned till within fifty paces of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to render their approach more difficult; and however, they fired continually with their ſmall ſhot, and threw a multitude of ſtones, yet they killed and wounded but thirteen men. The beſiegers had now fourteen Mortars mounted, out of which they perpetually toſſed Bombs and Carkaſſes. There was nothing done at the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, but ſecuring the works, and heightning the batteries. A <hi>Pole,</hi> who had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> came over this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and reported that the beſieged were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſurrender, if they were not relieved in a Months time. Another Run-away came this Afternoon, and declared, that five Turkiſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers were by the means of a little Bark land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Peſt</hi> ſide, who were by ſeveral ways to endeavour to arrive where the <hi>Seraskier</hi> was, and preſs the Succours which had been promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> diſpatched ſome Horſe towards <hi>Voitfar</hi> to conſume the Forage there, and watch the Enemies motion. A party of <hi>Tartars</hi> fell upon the Foragers on the other ſide the <hi>Danube,</hi> and took ſome Horſes, and two Grooms belonging to the Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> out of the Iſland of St. <hi>Margaret:</hi> the following Night, ſixty Granadiers with ſome Workmen were ſent to ruine the Line which the beſieged had begun before the breach of the Rondel, which luck'd ſo well, that they filled the Ditch with the loſs of two Soldiers only. The breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were every day enlarged, as well on the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> as the <hi>Bavier</hi> attack, and what the <hi>Turks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired in the night, was thrown down by day. All the Troops of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> are at preſent ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in their Quarters. The <hi>Turks</hi> made a ſally upon them in the Night, who, though they were well received, and purſued even to the Town Gate, yet they killed many brave men of the beſieged, and amongſt the reſt Field-Marſhal General <hi>Dorfeling</hi>'s Son, two Lieutenants, and twenty-ſeven Souldiers, with the like number wounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 6. A line of communication was made from the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack to that of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> which is but fifty paces from the Rondel of the middle Gate, and about ſixty from the breach on the right. This morning they ſhot the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non with that fury, that they quite threw down the two Rondels, and the Curtain, and at night throwing Bombs and Carkaſſes without ceaſing, they cauſed a fire to burn on the right of the Rondel, that could not be quenched in leſs than three hours time. The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> advanced their works briskly, their Generals of Battalia's keeping alternatively in the Trenches. They had eight ſlain and ſix wounded, beſides a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Granadeers, Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Fonk</hi> was alſo hurt in the Legg, and ſix more of the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> attack, beſides two killed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 7. The Night preceding, very many Bombs were thrown with ſucceſs, being they fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Town in two places, but upon the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Engeneer <hi>Gonzales,</hi> it was preſumed the Town would be thundred with greater violence, he is expected in two or three days in the Camp, where the Cannon, Mortars, Bombs, Carkaſſes, and other artificial fire-works of his invention are already arrived: The beſieged made this morning a ſalley upon the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> with Horſe and Foot, but to their prejudice, being beaten back with diſorder. Yeſterday the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners began to work in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack to wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the breaches, and this Night the ſame will be done in that of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> where they have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed two new Batteries, one of ten, and the other of ſeven Cannons, beſides a third on the Water ſide, to better the attack'd Rondel, and a Poſt by which the beſieged uſed to creep out into a covered way which they had made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rondel. Yeſterday the <hi>Bavarians</hi> had carried their approaches to the very foot of the Caſtle, ſo that they could come no nearer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breach was enlarged. The works in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack were ſo near the Wall, that they could advance no further, but by lodging in the breach. There were about fifty killed and hurt in the three attacks. The beſieged ſhot a Bomb, which falling upon one of the out-Batteries into a Barrel of Powder, killed nine Cannoneers that attended there.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>8th,</hi> Two new Batteries, each of three Demy-Cannon, were raiſed in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack nearer the Walls, and on the left, where they were equally advanced with the right, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches were advanced to the Wall of the Rondel; and as theſe Works were ſo near, there were twenty-five hurt and wounded, moſt with Stones and Granadoes, amongſt whom Major General <hi>Thungen</hi> was one, Major <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chosſhauſen</hi> had his Arm broke with a Muſquet, and ſome other Officers wounded. The Miners which were attack'd to the right of the Rondel, had not yet encountered the Enemies Mines. At night they will plant others to the left of the middle Rondel. Some Peaſants having found means to eſcape out of Town, came to the Camp, affirming, that there were ſtill above three hundred men which worked continually at the Mines and Retrenchments which the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged made behind their Walls, for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in caſe of neceſſity.</p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:39539:158"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the ninth, the whole Night was ſpent in ſhooting of Bombs and Carcaſſes into the City, to keep the beſieged in Action, and take away their deſire of repoſe, but theſe perceiving at break of day that the Enemy had made a Gallery of Planks to paſs the Miners to the middle Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, they rolled down many Bombs, threw many Granados, and other artificial Fire, with combuſtible ſtuff in ſuch abundance, that the Planks were burnt, and the Gallery reduced to Aſhes. At five in the Morning the beſieged ſprung a Mine ſome Paces from the Wall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the middle Rondel, and that at the Gate with Succeſs, being it overturned one of the Chriſtians Mines, with the loſs of ſeven or eight of the Miners. They ſeconded this with a ſharp Sally, diſordered the Workmen, ruined their Labours, and poſted themſelves betwixt the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> but the reſerve coming to their Aid from their place of Arms, they forced them back into the Town. There were above eighty of the two Attacks killed and wounded in this Adventure, one of their chief Cannoneers ſlain, and ſeveral ſubaltern Officers. The beſieged loſt as many; Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this check, the Works were continued with the ſame Vigour in the Approaches, Lines, and Galleries. On the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide they ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the little Port from their Battery with ten demy Cannons, and the breach there was very ſpacious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the tenth, At the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack they work'd all Night to repair the Batteries and the Approaches which the beſieged had ruined in the former Sally, and to redreſs the Gallery which they had burnt, and the Miners were again fired that Night. At the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack the Miners worked under the Palizade of the Rondel, and under the Wall, with hopes of compleating their Mines in three days; ſeveral were ſlain, amongſt whom was Lieutenent-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Wachtenheim.</hi> The Chriſtians had Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by their Spies, that the Turks, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeven thouſand, reinforced with ſome <hi>Tartars</hi> who ravaged the Country, had a deſign to introduce a new Commander, with a recruit of Troops into <hi>Buda,</hi> which obliged the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to command ſome Foot to poſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the other ſide of the <hi>Danube,</hi> and upon occaſion to joyn with the Horſe that were there already, and meet and fight the Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the eleventh, This evening five demy Cannons were mounted on the two new Batteries in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack, and two Mortars planted in a little Fort, with the loſs only of two killed, and five hurt. The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> placed three pieces in battery, and would plant more the Night following to ſhoot glowing Bullets into the City. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> fortified their Attack by two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts. Yeſterday in the Evening four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot were ordered to raiſe ſome Defences on <hi>Peſt</hi> ſide near the <hi>Danube,</hi> to hinder leſt any thing ſhould paſs that way into <hi>Buda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the twelfth, All the Batteries of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> were compleated, and the firſt lines of theſe two Attacks were ſo joyned, that men could paſs from the one to the other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, by the Enemies Fire. And now they were ſo near the Walls, the beſieged did perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually throw hand Granadoes and Stones to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Workmen, but without any great harm. The Miner on the left found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much advanced under the Wall, but they met with more difficulty on the right, and ſo they would inlarge the breach by force of their Cannon. The Count <hi>de Souches</hi> inſpected the breach by order of the Field Marſhal <hi>Starenberg,</hi> and it was found ſpacious enough to be aſſaulted: The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> began to ſhoot their infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Bullets and Bombs out of twenty two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and two Mortars, but with no great Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, being the Beſieged had uncovered all their Houſes. The Bombs and Carcaſſes invented by the <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Frier were highly eſteemed. They now only plained and inlarged the Breaches, and prepared themſelves for the aſſault. There were nine hurt and three ſlain with Granadoes and Stones. The Breach in the great Rondel on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide was large enough, and the Miner was at work under the Pallizade of the Ditch. The Duke having Intelligence that the Seraskier was advanced with ſome thouſands of Turks near <hi>Hatwan,</hi> commanded 3000 Horſe, and ſix Battalions of Foot, <hi>Imperialiſts, Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers,</hi> and <hi>Bavarians,</hi> under the Conduct of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Mercy,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> and poſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the other ſide of the Bridge, to hinder the Turks to put a recruit of Troops into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with the new deſigned Commander, <hi>Achmet</hi> Baſſa, who had the Reputation of being one of the beſt Officers that the Grand Seignior had in his Service.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the thirteenth, This morning the beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſprung a Mine under the middle Rondel near the Chriſtians Mine, which was already finiſhed, which Mine did what the beſiegers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, by throwing down part of the Rondel, where they had no breach as yet. There were two hundred Turks ready to fly into the adverſe Works as ſoon as the Mine took, but ſeeing it had a contrary effect to what they deſigned, they retired. All things being diſpoſed for an aſſault, thereby to make a lodgment upon the Wall, Count <hi>Starenburg</hi> directed the attack in the manner following. Count <hi>Guydo Starenburg</hi> commanded on the right of the Rondel, Count <hi>Herberſtein</hi> the middle of the Curtain, and Count <hi>Aversberg,</hi> all three field Officers, on the left. They had each of them two hundred and eighty Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; the Engineers, Granadeers, Fuſeliers, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, and Pioneers, were poſted betwixt two, and the reſt, to the number of two thouſand, were divided into three bodies of Reſerves to ſupport the Aſſailants: the Voluntiers who had demanded the point, mingled themſelves with the firſt. Betwixt ſeven and eight a Clock the ſignal for the Aſſault was given, by a diſcharge from all the Batteries, and a ſhower of Bombs and Carcaſſes which were diſcharged upon the City, and the Retrenchments which the beſieged had made behind the breach; and notwithſtanding all the reſiſtance of the beſieged, the Chriſtians mounted the breach, where the Combat was very rude and obſtinate on both ſides for three quarters of an hour, with all poſſible bravery. The beſieged ſprung a Mine under the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants firſt line, which buried Captain <hi>Kalkreiter,</hi> and ſome Souldiers. But ſeeing they could not take poſt for want of Earth, that they could not force the Pallizado'd Retrenchment behind the breach, and that the chief Officers were already all hurt or ſlain, by the continual fire of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; it was thought expedient to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; five or ſix leap'd over the Turks Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but being ill followed, got off with the reſt. The Regiments of <hi>Souches</hi> and <hi>Mansfeld</hi> ſuffered moſt in this Action, and that of <hi>Staren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> was alſo ill treated. There were more than four hundred kill'd and wounded, but the loſs of ſo many brave Officers and Voluntiers who loſt their Lives there, were particularly deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but few that were hurt eſcaped, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a belief that the Turks ſhot with envenom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bullets. Amongſt the dead were Count <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſtein,</hi>
                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:39539:159"/>Count <hi>Kuffſtein,</hi> and another Captain of the ſame Regiment, the Baron <hi>Rolle,</hi> three Captains more, and eight Lieutenants and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Of Voluntiers that were ſlain there, or died of their Wounds, the Duke of <hi>Vexar,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was one of the firſt upon the breach, was one, a Son of Prince <hi>Roberts,</hi> with another Engliſh Lord, the Baron of <hi>Scheyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> the young Count of <hi>Courmaillon,</hi> a Conte of <hi>Dona,</hi> and ſeven or eight more of Quality. Amongſt the wounded, as well Officers as Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers, were reckoned Count <hi>Guydo Starenburg,</hi> Count <hi>Averſperg,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Veldens</hi> of the Houſe of the Palatinat, Prince <hi>Picolomini,</hi> two Engliſh Lords, the Duke of <hi>Eſcalona,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Valero,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>Vexar,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Commercy,</hi> and more than thirty other Perſons of mark. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> diſtinguiſhed themſelves by a noble Emulation, oppoſing the greateſt Fury of the Turks. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo ill treated, that of twenty of them, all Perſons of Quality, there were but ſix of them that were not ſlain or wounded. The loſs of the beſieged was alſo great, for they had two hundred of their bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt men wounded and killed. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and Marſhal Count <hi>Starenburg</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in this Action, giving Orders every where as occaſion required. It was believed that the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> would have attempted ſomewhat on their ſide, but they excuſed it becauſe their breach was not large enough. On the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide there was a notable breach made in the Rondel and in the Wall that covers the Caſtle, which the beſieged repaired by Night with Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions, Pallizadoes, and Fagots.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> the fourteenth, The whole Night and Day were imployed in inhuming the Dead, and repairing the Approaches, in planting more Cannon upon the Batteries, and in advancing the Mines. Two Galleries were likewiſe fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med betwixt the ſecond and third Rondel. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having alſo ſent for three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of Horſe from <hi>Alba-Regalis</hi> to reinforce General <hi>Mercy,</hi> they paſſed the Bridge this Morning to go on <hi>Peſt</hi> ſide. The beſieged ſprung a Mine in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack on the left of the Caſtle <hi>Rondel,</hi> which ſucceeded ill. His Electoral Highneſs having cauſed eight Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapets of thick Oaken Planks to be made, ſhod with Iron, of a new Invention, each capable of ſecuring a hundred armed Men, they were thought proper to be uſed in Attacks and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults. The ſame day the <hi>Bavarians</hi> diſcovered and diſappointed two Mines of the Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 15th,</hi> They continued to work in their Lines, and being lodged cloſe to the Wall, the Beſieged were heard to work under the Breach. <hi>Gonzales</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Engineer being now come, Bombs and Carcaſſes were thrown into the Town, which did great Execution. Upon the Advice that the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had, that the Turks that had paſſed the <hi>Tibiſcus</hi> near <hi>Segedin,</hi> were ſtill encamped under the Cannon of <hi>Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan,</hi> he cauſed two Regiments of Horſe more to joyn <hi>Mercy</hi> to oblige the Enemy to repaſs the <hi>Tibiſcus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 16th,</hi> A new Battery was raiſed in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack without the Wall of the lower Town to the right againſt the great Rondel, the which was alſo batter'd on the other ſide to render the Breach larger, and themſelves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it. A <hi>Raſcian,</hi> with Letters which the Governour of the Place had entruſted him to carry to him of <hi>Alb-Royal,</hi> came and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the Duke; but they being writ in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Language, and no Interpreter in the Camp, they were ſent to <hi>Vienna</hi> to be decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered. Some Peaſants got out of the Town reported, that the Janizaries had begun to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur againſt the Baſſa, as deſigning to hold out to the laſt extremity, but that he had by the Puniſhment of the moſt mutinous, by his Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and the aſſurance he had given them of ſpeedy relief, reaſſured them to that degree, that they promiſed to hold out with their Lives. This Evening the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> commanded 150 men, ſeconded by a greater number to go and attack the Palizado which was in the Ditch at the foot of the Rondel of the Caſtle. Lieutenant-General Count <hi>Fountain</hi> was on the right of the Attack, and General Count <hi>Aſpremont</hi> at the left. They uſed three of the above mentioned wooden Parapets for the firſt time with Succeſs, and they attack'd this Poſt ſo vigorouſly, that they carried it with their Swords in their Hands, cutting in pieces all them that defended it, but they ſold their Lives dearly, being the Aſſailants loſt Count <hi>Fountaine</hi> and 35 Souldiers, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers. Count <hi>Aſpermont</hi> received a Contuſion in his Head by the ſtroke of a Muſquet which knock'd off his Steel Cap. The Captains <hi>Gotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linsky</hi> and <hi>Vaubon</hi> were dangerouſly hurt, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others. This Poſt gave acceſs to the Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 17th,</hi> Yeſterday the Beſieged began to fire from a new Battery of four great Guns, which they had raiſed upon the inward Wall; but General <hi>Starenberg</hi> having commanded all the Cannon that could bear to ſhoot that way, they were quickly ſilenced and diſabled. About Noon twenty or thirty Janizaries appeared upon the Breach of the Rondel to the right, as if they had deſigned a Sally, but thoſe in the Trenches having given them a Volly, they quickly reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> and <hi>Bavarians</hi> did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but compleat their Works, beſides their continual firing from their Batteries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 18th,</hi> A new line was advanced to the right, the better to cover the Miners, and be of uſe in the ſubſequent Aſſault. The <hi>Brandenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> augmented their great Battery with three pieces of Cannon. Nor were the <hi>Bavarians</hi> idle, their Miners working under the Wall behind the Pallizado Moat, of which they were in poſſeſſion. The Beſieged did not much appear by day, but in the Night time kept continual firing, killing a great many of the Beſiegers with their Stones and Granadoes, which they threw into their Works.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 19. The Cannon was mounted upon the new Battery, and the Line was ſtrengthned with two ſmall Forts. Laſt night the Beſieged ſprung a Mine behind our Miners, who worked under the Wall, which endammaged our Mine, into which a new entry was to be made to make it ſerviceable. Some of the Chriſtian Miners were covered with earth, moſt of which were pulled out again, except <hi>Libert</hi> their Captain, who could not be found. Mr. <hi>Kerry,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Gentleman, with ſeven or eight Souldiers were killed in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, beſides others wounded. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> aſſiſted by the General perſons of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, held a Council of War this morning, but the reſult was kept ſecret. Some Deſerters aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Duke, that the Beſieged reſolved to make no compoſition, but to expect the Relief which the Grand <hi>Viſier</hi> would bring them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 20. The new Line in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack was compleated. There were three falſe alarms given to haraſs the Beſieged, by cauſing ſome Granadeers to run up the Breach, and throw their Granado's into the place, upon which the Turks haſtening to the defence, they were ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:39539:159"/>with Volleys of Cannon, Bombs, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſes, not without execution. Theſe kind of attacks were frequently uſed to keep the Enemy in continual alarms, and in ignorance of the time of the real Aſſault. In the mean time the Mines were vigorouſly carried on, and a certain <hi>German</hi> undertook a new one, which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to finiſh in two or three days. In the attacks of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> the Miners hoped to be the following Night under the Rondels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to batter the Walls with great fury, and to ſhoot glowing Bullets, Bombs and Carkaſſes into the City, which produced much diſorder. Upon advice that the Turks diſpoſed themſelves to attempt to put relief into the Town, the Ditch of the Circumvallation was deepened, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with certain Redoubts, the better to ſecure the Beſiegers, to which purpoſe 200 <hi>Heyducks</hi> were added to the number of Pioneers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 21. The principal working was now at the Mines, which were made in three ſeveral places, and would ſuddenly be ready. Captain <hi>Libert,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the diligence that had been uſed to dig and remove the earth to ſeek him, had not been found. He was a <hi>Walloon</hi> by Nation, and was regretted by all the Generals, and ſuch who had skill of his knowledge in conducting of Mines. The Miners were now within hearing of each other. A Battery was alſo raiſed for four Mortars, near the three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pieces which beat upon the Rondel on the right, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to approach all the Cannon and Mortars nearer the Breaches, to batter them with more force, that they might inlarge them with more eaſe, and ruine the Enemies Defences, which were behind the ſaid Breaches. There were twenty-ſeven ſlain and wounded only at the <hi>Lorrain</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack; amongſt the dead were Major <hi>Bacneburg</hi> a <hi>Dane,</hi> and Captain <hi>Lerneux</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> of <hi>Starenberg</hi>'s Regiment. <hi>Gonzales</hi>'s Bombs and Carcaſſes had the Succeſs expected, and by report of a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, one of thoſe Bombs ſunck into a Houſe where a hundred Perſons of both Sexes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, who all miſerably periſhed in the Ruines of it. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> finiſhed their Battery near the Rondel, and began another on the Water ſide, to canonade the Flancks of the City on that ſide. At preſent, being the three Attacks were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced as far as the Breaches, which were large enough, all things were diſpoſed for a general Aſſault, two thouſand Ladders being got ready for falſe and ſeeming Attacks by ſcaling the Walls, whilſt others mounted the Breaches.</p>

                     <hi>July 22th,</hi> There hapned nothing at the <hi>Lorrain</hi> or <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Attack, the Turks ſprung two Mines this Morning, which did nothing but ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine a part of the Curtain, where there was no Breach. The new Battery of four Guns upon the brink of the Ditch of the Rondel in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varian</hi> Attack being finiſhed, the Turks came there at break of day, and gave them a bloody Serenade, for a ſtrong party of them having ſlipped out by the Bridge on the right, they crept into the Ditch along the Paliſade, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the Battery, before they were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, by favour of the Darkneſs, they began to howl and make terrible cries, nailing up three Cannon, and a Mortar, and ruining part of the Battery: The <hi>Saxons</hi> of the neighbouring Poſts ran to the noiſe, but were diſordered. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> which was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reſerve, arrived ſeaſonably, and repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Turks with the loſs of thirty men, which was but a ſorry compenſation conſidering the loſs on the other ſide, where above one hundred were killed and wounded, the moſt <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Bavarians.</hi> Amongſt the ſlain, Collonel <hi>Lebel,</hi> a <hi>Saxon</hi> was one, beſides ſeveral Subalternes, and <hi>Geſchwint,</hi> Collonel of the Artillery, was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly wounded with a Cymitar. The Turks got no great advantage by this Sally, for the Nailes being eaſily drawn, they began in a very little time to play again, as if they never had been nailed. And the revenge which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned was ſudden and fatal, for a Bomb of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> falling into the Magazine of Powder in the Caſtle,<note place="margin">The Caſtle is blown up.</note> blew it up with ſuch a terrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and noiſe, that the whole City did not only tremble with the blow, but alſo the whole Camp, and, as was afterward reported by ſome fugitives, more than one thouſand perſons of all ages were buried in the ruines, the ſtones being thrown up with the violence of the Powder in ſuch abundance, that they fell like Hail into the approaches, that many of the Beſiegers were hurt by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 23. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Mines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now all ready, and all things ready for an aſſault, ſent the Count of <hi>Koningſec</hi> with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter to the Beſieged to ſummon them to ſurrender. In this interval there was a ceſſation of Arms on both ſides, which was employed in burying the ſlain. The ſaid Count, after two hours ſtay, returned into the Camp with a Letter from <hi>Abdi Baſſa,</hi> in a Purſe of Crimſon Damask, which he delivered the Duke. The anſwer was fierce and arrogant, implying, that not being neceſſitated to ſurrender, he could not be capable of ſo abject a thought, that he fought for the glory of his <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the honour of the <hi>Muſſelmen;</hi> that he and his Garriſon were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to try the utmoſt extremity, and to defend the place with their lateſt breath. That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment had been intruſted to his care by the Grand Seignior, which he would preſerve for him, or loſe his life; that when the Duke ſhould come to wreſt it from him, he ſhould find him upon the Breach to diſpute his entrance, and that he might order the aſſault when he pleaſed, he would expect him there without ſtirring a foot. The Duke having read this brave anſwer, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all the Batteries to fire with more fury than formerly, and all the preparatives for a general Aſſault to be made ready, for which purpoſe he ſent for ſome thouſands of <hi>Hungarian</hi> Foot, who had voluntarily offered to be the firſt that ſhould mount the Breaches.</p>
                  <p>So fierce an anſwer and ſo brave a defence, makes it apparent, that the impreſſions which the Run-aways had at the beginning of the Siege given of <hi>Abdi Baſſa</hi>'s conduct, were very falſe, affirming he was deſpiſed by the Souldiery, as being more a Merchant than a Man of War; and the <hi>Seraſquier</hi> was in the wrong in deſigning to remove him, for it is to be preſumed that ſcarce any other would have eluded the efforts of ſo great an Army ſo long time. A <hi>Pole</hi> was obſerved by the Guards in ſecret conference with two Turks, but upon his return to the Camp was ſeiſed upon, viſited and examined, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to be a Spy, he was immediately hanged. This evening a <hi>Bavarian</hi> Gunner was apprahended, as he was going over to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul. 24th,</hi> This morning about eight a Clock a great Mine was ſprung in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack, and 300 men were commanded to lodge upon the Breach, together with ſome hundreds of <hi>Hungarians,</hi> but the Mine had a contrary effect to what was deſigned, for it ruined and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw part of their own Approaches, and filled their Lines with Earth, beſides the ſlaughters of 100 men killed and wounded. The Duke upon this ill ſucceſs, cauſed the firings of the Batteries
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:39539:160"/>to be redoubled to enlarge the Breaches, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in a Condition to be mounted without any new Mines. The new Battery which the <hi>Bavarians</hi> rais'd by the Water ſide would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at Night, and that which they had already raiſed upon the brink of the Ditch, had made a great gap in the Wall on the right. By inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Letters he was alſo informed, that the Great Viſier highly encouraged the Beſieged to defend themſelves, aſſuring them that by the eighth or tenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> he would come to their relief with a formidable Army. General <hi>Caraffa</hi> who commanded the Imperial Troops upon the River <hi>Tibiſcus,</hi> ſent an Officer to the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with an acccount of a great Advantage which he had had over the Garriſon of <hi>Agria</hi> by the means of two Ambuſhes which he had laid for the Turks, which luck'd ſo well, that having drawn ſix hundred of the Garriſon into them, he quite defeated them, killed three hundred upon the Place, with <hi>Oſman</hi> Baſſa the Commander of <hi>Agria,</hi> and took forty Priſoners, together with the <hi>Vice</hi> Baſſa, who was dangerouſly wounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 25th,</hi> The whole Night was ſpent in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the Works ruined by the Mine, which had been ſprung with ſo much diſadvantage. The Duke preſſed forward the Preparatives for the General Aſſault with all poſſible Vigour, having ordered the making of Places of Arms, or Parades, as were neceſſary, within the Lines and Approaches. Betwixt four and five the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged put fire to a Mine on the right of the Rondel, in purſuance whereof they ſallied with two hundred Men, but were repulſed by the Guard that were in readineſs with the loſs of fourteen men. A little after, they ſallied again in greater numbers to the left, where the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgers</hi> were, who likewiſe repulſed them. They returned yet the third time with more Troops, and put the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> Guards into diſorder, which obliged the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to order the Reſerve which was poſted at the Wall of the lower Town to advance, which General <hi>Souches,</hi> who commanded the Trenches, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts, whereof one was placed to the left on the Water ſide, another in the Approaches, and the third was commanded to keep by the Moſque. The Duke moreover cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Battalions of <hi>Mansfelt, Salm, Souches,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to advance to the right. The Skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laſted a good time, the Turks retiring of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and as ſoon returning with great fury and out-cryes. The <hi>Hayducks</hi> after the firſt diſcharge did alſo charge the Turks, but gave way, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning much confuſion amongſt them upon the left of the Moſque, from whence the Beſieged gave brisk fire with their Cannon, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great harm, ſo that ſeeing they could profit nothing by a longer ſtay, they retired into the Town. Count <hi>Starenberg,</hi> who had ſignali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed himſelf, luck'd better than his Adjoutant, who had both his Legs ſhot off. The Battalions of <hi>Souches</hi> and <hi>Mansfelt</hi> were ill treated, and had moſt dead. The Baron of <hi>Aſthi</hi> was hurt in the Foot, and the Baron of <hi>Hoghenworth</hi> ſlain, and ſeveral ſubaltern Officers killed and hurt, beſides above a hundred private Souldiers. But the loſs on the Enemies ſide was much greater, as was reported by a Dutch Boy who run out of Town, where he had been ſince the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſold by a <hi>Tartar</hi> to a Citizen of <hi>Buda.</hi> This Boy ſaid further, that the Turks made great Retrenchments within the Place, and that the Garriſon conſiſted ſtill of at leaſt five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 26th,</hi> Never was more Diligence uſed ſince the Siege began in carrying on the Lines and Approaches, than laſt Night, and all this Day to make the Places of Arms, which are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and at preſent every thing is diſpoſed of for the general Aſſault, and poſting themſelves upon the Breaches, the Rondels, and the Walls, and conſequently to render themſelves Maſters of this important Place, which had coſt the Chriſtians ſo much Blood. The Beſieged made a little ſally on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack, but having ſtood the firſt diſcharge, were forced to retreat as faſt as they came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 27th,</hi> Every thing being diſpoſed for the general Aſſault, and the Troops that were to be employed in it at their Rendezvouzes in all the three Attacks, it was reſolved that the Onſet ſhould be given at five a Clock in the Evening, to which end the Duke had diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Orders to all the Officers high and low, how they were to act. The Faggots, Gabions, Spades, Mattocks, Hatchets, and Sacks with Earth, were there in great abundance, as well to break the Enemies Retrenchments, as to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Aſſailants when they ſhould be Maſters of the Breaches. The ſignal was given from <hi>Peſt</hi> by ſome Cannon ſhot, and the Aſſault was carried on in manner following. Forty Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers under the command of a Captain, one Lieutenant, and one Serjeant, were at the head of the Rondel to the right hand, they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by fifty Fuſeliers and Souldiers, with Hatchets, commanded alſo by a Captain-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and a Serjeant, with a hundred men carrying Spades and Mattocks, ſupported by two Captains, two Lieutenants, two Serjeants, and two hundred Muſqueteers, all under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Prince of <hi>Newburg,</hi> Great Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order, who had the Direction of this Attack. That of the middle toward the Curtain was directed by Lieutenant General <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;</hi> there were fifty Granadeers under a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Lieutenant and Serjeant, a hundred Fuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, two hundred men with Hatchets, and to ſecond them two hundred Muſqueteers, divided into two ſquadrons, which were followed with a hundred and fifty more, with Shovels and Mattocks: The Attack on the left of the little Rondel was ordered by the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> after the ſame manner. Behind the Sacks filled with Earth, Wooll, and the like, in the ſecond line were poſted a party of choice Harquebuſiers, who were not to ſtir thence, but fire continually upon the Turks, who ſtood there themſelves in the Breaches. The <hi>Heyducks,</hi> commanded by the Lieutenant Governour of <hi>Raab,</hi> were poſted on the Water ſide, where a great part of the Wall had been thrown down by the fire of the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin already mentioned; they were only to make a falſe Attack, being ſeconded by a Major with ſome ſelect Companies. The chief Officers were diſperſed into ſeveral Poſts to execute the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of their Employments; and thus <hi>Nigrelli,</hi> General of Battalia, Collonel <hi>Keth,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Rederer,</hi> and the Major of <hi>Staremberg</hi> aſſiſted the grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order. General <hi>Souches</hi> had for Aſſiſtants <hi>Diependal,</hi> Count <hi>Octtingen,</hi> Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Jorger,</hi> and the Major of <hi>Crop</hi>'s Regiment. There were above 1200 men of reſerves in the covered way, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General <hi>Thungen,</hi> under twelve Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, twelve Lieutenants, and other ſubaltern Officers, with all the other Lieutenant Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and Majors, to ſucceed in the place of thoſe that ſhould be ſlain or wounded. The 1200 Muſqueteers were to advance in ſmall parties in the Lines as the other gained ground; the reſt of the Foot were at their Arms ready to engage,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:39539:160"/>and all the Generals in the Trenches. In this order the Souldiers full of Hopes and Courage went to the Aſſault, and mounted the Breaches. They found great Oppoſition, particularly at the great Rondel where the Breach was high, and the Defendants very numerous and reſolute. The Chriſtians were beat back two or three times, but returning ſtill to the Aſſault, they at length took poſſeſſion of the Breach, and poſted themſelves in it. The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> took the Wall of the little Rondel. The Combat laſted from five till nine a Clock with great effuſion of Blood, not ſo much by the Turks Arms as their Mines, and Powder which they had ſtrewed in great quantities in ſeveral places, which they ſucceſſively fired as they were forced from their Poſts. There could be nothing more lamentable than to ſee two or three hundred men at once toſſed up by force of the Mines, which were moſt killed, or grievouſly wounded. And yet the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged could not terrifie the Chriſtians, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them by their obſtinate reſiſtance to lodge upon the Rondels and the Curtain. The <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducks</hi> apprehending the fire, failed in their falſe alarming on the Water ſide. The Duke and General <hi>Staremberg</hi> were near the Great Maſter with their Swords in their Hands, encouraging the Officers and Souldiers to do well, and the Prince of <hi>Croy</hi> was in the middle near the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where he was hurt. The Night being come put an end to the fight, and it was ſpent in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing their Lodgments with two Lines of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from the Approaches to the poſſeſſed Rondels, and the Miners were faſtned to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Wall or Retrenchment, where the Turks fortified themſelves. This Aſſault was one of the bloodieſt, the moſt hardy, and beſt diſputed that ever was ſeen, whether we conſider the bravery and intrepidneſs of the Aſſailants, or the obſtinate Valour of the Defendants. The number of the ſlain, amongſt whom was Adjou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant General <hi>Attein,</hi> was not very great, but that of the wounded very ſurpriſing, of which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue were the Prince of <hi>Croy,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Commercy,</hi> General <hi>Diependael,</hi> General <hi>Thungen,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Aſti,</hi> the Major of <hi>Starenberg,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonel <hi>Redere,</hi> Major <hi>Pini,</hi> Conte, <hi>Schlick,</hi> Baron <hi>Gera,</hi> and many other <hi>Captains</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterne Officers. On the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> ſide, Count <hi>Dona,</hi> Collonel of Foot was ſlain, Major <hi>Marwitz,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Curland</hi> grievouſly wounded, with very many others.</p>
                  <p>At the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack the Elector had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Aſſault in this manner. The Palizades upon the Breach having been burnt the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by forty choice Souldiers, the Elector com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Lieutenant with 20 Fuſeliers, a <hi>Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> ſix Voluntiers, and ten Granadeers, and a Corporal, with ſix Carpenters to cut the Paliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, an 100 Muſqueteers with their Officers were ordered to poſt themſelves at the Enemies Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zade, and to ſhoot without ceaſing to favoriſe the Pioneers to make the Lodgment upon the Rondel, amongſt which there were twenty five with Spades and Pickaxes and 75 with Hatchets commanded by a Captain, and ſeconded by a Lieutenant-Collonel, a Major and a Captain, with fifty men armed with half Pikes, Halberds, and Partizans, by a Lieutenant with thirty Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deers, and by 200 Muſquetters under two Captains and two Lieutenants. Things being thus diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as well on the right as the left, the two Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Redoubts were furniſhed each with thirty Harquebuſiers, and three Battalions of <hi>Imperialiſts, Bavarians</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> were to ſecond the Aſſailants. The Gunners had order to fire from all the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and to throw Bombs and Carcaſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing into the Caſtle, and betwixt the two Walls on the Water ſide, as alſo to point their Cannon againſt the high Walls and Windows of the Caſtle. All things being thus ordered, and the ſignal given from <hi>Peſt,</hi> they advanced towards the Breach, however difficult to mount on the right and left of the Rondel, as alſo the Curtain, and that with ſo much Vigour, that they became Maſters of the Poſt, driving out the Beſieged for all their inceſſant firing, and a ſhower of Stones which they threw from their Caſtle Windows. They alſo took the <hi>Swingher,</hi> which is a great Place in form of a retreat betwixt the Walls and the Houſes, but this Place being commanded by the ſaid Walls, whence the Turks annoyed the Aggreſſors with Granadoes, Stones, and Bombs which they rolled down; the Elector cauſed thoſe that were there to retire, being content to ſecure the Lodgments upon the Rondel, and the Wall of the Caſtle by a Line of Communication from the Gate of the Bridge to that of the <hi>Swingher,</hi> ſo that the Bridge remained in their Power, which was further ſecured by traverſe Lines, and two Redoubts. The Elector eminently appeared in all this Action, and the Generals ſignalized their Courage, as did alſo the Voluntiers, Officers and Souldiers, who fought with all the bravery that was to be expected from men of Courage. Nor were the Turks leſs commendable for their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Fidelity, doing every thing that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Valour could be capable of. They who defended the Rondel and the Swinger were for the moſt part killed and hurt. There were eight pieces of Cannon found there, and two Mortars turned now againſt the Beſiegeds ſecond Wall and Retrenchments. In this Aſſault, of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians</hi> there were ſlain two Majors, two Captains, four Lieutenants, one Enſign, but the wounded were many; one Collonel, two Lieutenant-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, two Majors, 25 Captains, 16 Lieutenants, thirteen Enſigns. The Generals <hi>Lavergne, Rummel,</hi> and <hi>Aſpremont</hi> were of the number of the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as alſo the Duke of <hi>Eſcalona,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and ſome other Voluntiers of Quality, making up with the Officers and Souldiers the number of 117 ſlain, and 972 wounded. Of the Troops of <hi>Saxony,</hi> a Lieutenant-Collonel, and ſome under Officer were killed; one Lieutenant-Collonel, two Majors, two Captains, one Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-Lieutenant, and three Enſigns were hurt; of the Souldiers there were ſeventy ſlain, and a hundred ninety nine wounded; ſo that the number of the ſlain and wounded in this Aſſault amounted to above three thouſand men.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 28, In the three Attacks they were only employed in burying their dead, and ſecuring their Lodgments upon the Breaches. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> did alſo apply the Miner to the ſecond Wall, which was done in three ſeveral Places, as did alſo they of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July</hi> 29. The three Mines in the ſecond Wall were ſprung with that Succeſs that they made a new Breach there, and filled part of the Ditch with the Ruins. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> advanced to the right of the Rondel, and ſeized two Mortars there, which they turned againſt the Beſieged. The great Cannon was advanced, and they pretended to batter the City with an 100 pieces of Ordnance, and forty Mortars, if the Turks continued in their Obſtinacy. The Beſieged howſoever made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuts and Retrenchments behind the ſecond Wall. The Duke ſeeing that well nigh all the Generals of the Infantry were hurt and in no Condition to act, order'd for the future that the Generals of the Horſe ſhould ſerve in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, to wit, the Count of <hi>Stirum,</hi> and the Conte of <hi>Lodron,</hi> and ſo the firſt mounted the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:39539:161"/>Guard that Night with General <hi>Souches,</hi> and was to be relieved on the morrow by the grand Maſter of the Teutonick Order, and the Count <hi>de Lodron.</hi> A Battery of three Demy-Cannon, and another of four were finiſhed. Some <hi>Raſcians</hi> come out of the place, reported, that the beſieged were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to defend themſelves to the laſt extremity, but that ſome began to waver, ſaying, the further effuſion of bloud ought to be prevented. A Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War was held thereupon, and the reſult was, that the Duke ſhould ſend a ſecond Summons to the Commander of the place, <hi>to ſurrender whilſt it was time, and that he might do it upon honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, which if neglected he would not be anſwerable for the bloud that ſhould be ſpilt, if they came to the laſt extremity, being in that caſe they ſhould spare neither Sex nor Age. Abdi Baſſa</hi> civilly received his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Letters, and demanded a Day to conſult with the other Officers of his Garriſon, which was granted him, with a ceſſation of Arms. The Deſerters, who eſcaped in great numbers, affirm'd that the Beſieged loſt in the laſt Aſſault, in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, only 300 ſlain, and 700 hurt. They had that Night notice that 4000 Turkiſh Horſe were ſeen within four Leagues of the Camp, to enquire into the ſtate of the place, but fearing a ſurpriſe, they preſently retired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 31. At nine in the Morning the Count of <hi>Launberg,</hi> Adjoutant General, was commanded by the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to go with an Interpreter, and received the Beſieged's anſwer, which was to this purpoſe, <hi>That he neither could nor would ſo eaſily ſurrender the City, it being the Key of the Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; but if they would make a general peace, they would give another equivalent.</hi> After noon the Beſieged demanded a ſuſpenſion of Arms at the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, and ſent two <hi>Aga</hi>'s in Hoſtage to the Elector, who ſent the Baron of <hi>Creuz</hi> Lieutenant Collonel of <hi>Baden</hi>'s Regiment with an Interpreter. The Turks received them with great ceremony, and all imaginable civilities. He was not immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted before the Baſſa, but to another Houſe, the ſtreets as he paſſed along were lined with Souldiers in very good order, though no great number. Being entered into the Houſe, he was preſented with Rice, a roſted Pullet, little Py<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, Coffee and Wine. The Baſſa excuſed himſelf, <hi>That he could not yet ſpeak with him, being he conſulted the other chief Officers upon the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he was to make to him.</hi> In this interval of time many Turkiſh Officers came to ſalute the Baron: half an hour after the Baſſa ſent him word, <hi>That he would take it for a favour if he would come over to him.</hi> Which he immediately did, accompanied with a great number of Turks, being taken by the arms by the two chiefeſt of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> who led him thus before the Baſſa, who was in a Lodge of Wood over-againſt his Houſe, very well furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and hung with rich Tapiſtries. Having cauſed the Baron to ſit down, he uſed this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him, <hi>That he was ſorry to find himſelf in a place of that importance, that had been ſo often beſieged without ſucceſs, and was now ſo long abandoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relief. On the contrary, that he found himſelf preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Emperour's Son-in-law, and the grand Viſier, that he wiſhed he were able to give his reſolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſurrender, but that being an affair of the laſt importance, and as much as his life was worth, it was impoſſible for him to reſolve upon a ſurrender.</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding however, <hi>That if they would demand any other place in Hungary, he would cauſe it immediately to be evacuated for them:</hi> The Baron replied, <hi>That he had no Commiſſion to diſcourſe of conditions, but only to know from the Baſſa himſelf whether he would ſurrender or no. That he might pleaſe to conſider that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were already Maſters of the Walls of the City, that it would be too late to capitulate, if he ſtayed till another aſſault, that it would not be in the power of the Generals to reſtrain the fury of the Souldiers, or prevent this Siege from being as Tragical as that of Newheuſel.</hi> At this diſcourſe the Baſſa only lift up his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but the Baron being upon the point to take his leave, he deſired him to enter with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Cabinet, where, calling the <hi>Mufti</hi> and three other Turks of the firſt rank, he remonſtrated to him again, <hi>That he could not upon any conſideration do ſo great a prejudice to the</hi> Grand Seignior, <hi>as to ſurrender a place upon which depended</hi> two hundred Leagues of Country, <hi>and which is the</hi> Key of Turky, <hi>but offered again any Town in Hungary with its Appendances and Dependencies.</hi> Yet declaring fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, <hi>That if they would give him aſſurances of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral peace with the Port, he would yet reſolve to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render Buda.</hi> The Baron having no Orders to treat, took leave of the Baſſa, telling him he would make report to the Elector and Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> of the Declaration he had communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, but that he could not aſſure him that things would be ſo concluded. The Baſſa deſired this Declaration might be publiſhed in Writing through the Camp; and invited him to ſtay all Night in the City: But the Baron ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the later, deſiring to be reconducted to the place from whence he came, which was done with great ceremony, he being accompanied with many <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Officers to the Gate. Nor the Baron, nor his Interpreter could ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the ruines occaſioned in the City by the Bombs and Carkaſſes which had beaten down the greateſt part of the Buildings. The Ceſſation which had been obſerved during this Parley was broke towards Evening, the Cannon beginning to fire with more fury than formerly. The Beſieged ſprang a Counter-mine in the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> attack, to ruine the Chriſtians Mine made under their Battery, oppoſite to the great Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, but without ſucceſs. A while after, two of the Beſiegers Mines, which were deſigned to fill the Ditch, were fired with execution. Count <hi>Starenberg</hi> looking betwixt two Gabions was hurt with a Musket-ſhot, but without danger, 20 or 30 more were hurt and killed in this and the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> attack.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 1. A Battery was finiſhed in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack upon the Rondel, upon which two pieces of Cannon were planted. A Mine was ſprung in the Morning near this Rondel, and though it ſucceeded well, there was no other attempt made, becauſe the Moat was not ſufficiently filled, and ſo it was reſolved to fill it with Faggots, with Sacks of Earth, and the like Materials, which were carried in abundance upon the place. The Workmen perceived ſo great a ſtink in this Mine, that they could ſcarce endure it, two of them, who were ſuffocated with it, being carried out of it. About Noon, intelligence came that 7000 <hi>Turks</hi> were poſted at <hi>Sexaritwan</hi> thirteen Leagues from <hi>Buda,</hi> and that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had begun to paſs the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> with the Army that he had formed out of the Garriſons of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and the Neighbouring places, and with other Troops which he had got together, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which there were 7000 men drawn out of <hi>Boſſina.</hi> It was further aſſured that the defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt the Turks was very great, and that of 8000 Janizaries, which the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had brought from the middle of Turky, 3000 had deſerted upon the march: and yet he pretended his Army conſiſted of 50000 Combatants, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to attempt the relief of <hi>Bud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> General <hi>Dune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi> returned this afternoon to the Camp, with the Regiments of Horſe with which he had been on the ſide of the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> to inform
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:39539:161"/>himſelf of the march of the Enemy. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals <hi>Caraffa</hi> and <hi>Heuſler</hi> arrived alſo from <hi>Zol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock</hi> in two days, with 5000 Horſe and ſome <hi>Hungarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All things were diſpoſed for to aſſault the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wall. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> had thrown down a great part of the Wall with their Cannon, and a Mine, rendering themſelves Maſters of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Zwinger,</hi> where they at the ſame time ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Enemies Cannon and Mortars, which they turned againſt the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug. 2d.</hi> They continued to fill the Ditch: every thing was ready for the aſſault, which was deferred, becauſe of the continual rains. Upon the reiterated news brought in by Scouts of the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> having paſſed the Bridge at <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> all neceſſary preparations were made to receive him well, in caſe he attempted to relieve the Town.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 3. A Run-away, who pretended to be a Domeſtick of one of the moſt conſiderable Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the Town, declared, that the Beſieged had prepared a Mine, and begun a ſecond in the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> attack: That they expected with great impatience their Succours, and that of all thoſe which the Baſſa had ſent out, not one had returned, which rendered him very uneaſie and chagrin, and that the number of ſerviceable <hi>Soldiers</hi> exceeded not 2000 beſides the Inhabitants. The Beſiegers could not finiſh their great Mine becauſe of a Rock they met. Some ſmall Banks and Parapets were made upon the Breach to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Souldiers firing during the aſſault, which was ordered in the manner following. At noon the Trenches were relieved, and thoſe that went off were appointed for reſerves. The firſt attack was to the right of the Rondel. Fifty Granadeers with a Captain, and Lieutenant, and a Serjeant followed by 20 men preceded, theſe were follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by 50 Fuſeliers Officer'd as the firſt, and 50 men which followed them with Hatchets. The ſame method was held by the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> on the left, and the <hi>Hungarians</hi> fell upon the Curtain in the middle, preceded by 30 <hi>Germans,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by 60 with their neceſſary Officers. The aſſault began betwixt 5 and 6 a clock in preſence of all the Generals, the Great Maſter of the Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Order commanding the Trenches. The deſign, by reaſon the Mine had not the deſired effect, was but feigned, but the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being advertiſed by an Adjoutant, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had already effectively began the aſſault, did alſo command the falſe attack to be converted into a real one. The Fight laſted two hours. There were 1000 Troopers on foot, 300 whereof were employed in the aſſault, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved themſelves well, as the <hi>Hungarians</hi> alſo did; but the Breach being of difficult aſcent, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged very well covered with Paliſado's, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themſelves like deſperate men, the Duke would not riſque more of his people, contenting himſelf to make a Lodgment at the right of the angular Rondel, where 40 men immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched themſelves. There were not many kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Beſieged's fire, but about 200 wounded by Stones and Arrows, which were ſhot in ſuch abundance that it reſembled a ſhower of Hail. Count <hi>Leopold</hi> of <hi>Herberſteyn,</hi> a Lieutenant Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, Major <hi>Biſchophawſen, &amp;c.</hi> were of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the hurt. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> were not exempt from the ſame Artillery of Arrows and Stones, beſides Bombs which were rolled upon planks out of the windows of the Caſtle. The Prince of <hi>Savoy</hi> was hurt in the hand with an arrow, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with 3 Captains, ſome ſubaltern Officers, 7 or 8 Volunteers, and 90 Souldiers as well kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as wounded. Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> going in the morning to view the approaches, was ſhot with a Musket-bullet which burnt his Coat, and made a great contuſion upon his Breſt, but his Arms being of proof ſaved his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 4. The firing from the Batteries was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled from the three Attacks to enlarge the breaches, and ruine the Defences of the Beſieged. The Line of Circumvallation was ſtrengthened, being furniſhed with many Redoubts and Forts to flank the whole work. All the heights and eminences about the place were intrenched and poſſeſſed by the Beſiegers. The <hi>Heyducks</hi> took their Poſt along the inner Wall of the lower Town, and ſo the attacks were continued with the ſame vigour as before. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> raiſed a Battery of nine Guns of 24 ball upon the Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the Caſtle, wherewith they beat the Flanks and widened the Breach, but the Earth being very narrow and ſtreight, ſo that but few could paſs a breſt, the Beſieged might the better diſpute the acceſs of the Aſſailants.</p>
                  <p>The Scouts brought advice that the <hi>Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi> had effectively paſſed the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and that he had 20000 men with him, which with the Troops by <hi>Alba Regalis</hi> amounted to 40 or 50000, moſt old Soldiers, taken out of their Garriſons and Fortreſſes, into whoſe places they had put their new Levies. There came alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that the Baſſa of <hi>Agria,</hi> having aſſembled ſome thouſands of Turks out of the Garriſons of upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> was advanced near <hi>Hatwan,</hi> where he had commanded a great many Charets out of the Neighbourhood, to carry Pontoons to the <hi>Danube</hi> ſide, by means wherof he pretended to put relief into the Town, at the ſame time that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſhould attack the Lines on the other ſide. This advertiſement obliged the Chriſtian Generals to uſe ſuch neceſſary precautions which might ſecure them on <hi>Peſt</hi> ſide.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 5. In the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack the approaches were advanced from the great Rondel towards the ſecond Wall, where they had poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the aſſault of the <hi>3d.</hi> inſtant. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners were buſie at the right of the Breach, the better to attack the Enemy in flank, as alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Curtain, to blow up the Beſieged's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments behind the Breach. A Gallery was begun on the right of the Battery, to go into the inward Ditch, and the better to aſſure the attack the Flanks were palliſado'd. The beſieged ſpent the whole Night in throwing of Bombs, Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's, and Stones, to incommode the contrary Workmen, but without much harm, ſave the killing of 3 <hi>Heyducks,</hi> and wounding 5 or 6 other Soldiers. This afternoon one of their Bombs fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into a Barrel of Powder upon the Beſiegers Battery, killed five, and hurt three.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. A new Battery of two Demy-Cannon was raiſed in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack behind the great Rondel, by means whereof the Defence of the little Rondel was ruined, which the beſieged had hitherto uſed with great advantage. The Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians continued to fill the inward Moat with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, Tuns, Sacks with earth, and the like, and made a Redoubt behind the great battery to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Workmen. The <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varians</hi> continued their attacks with vigour, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe conſiderable intervening.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 7. Laſt Night ſeveral falſe alarms were given, as if the Turks were come to attempt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring the place. The Chriſtians continued to deepen the Ditch about their Lines, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their Poſts to make the Enemy deſpair of forcing their Camp. The Mines were alſo carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on with great induſtry, and would in 3 or 4 days be ready for execution. The <hi>Heyducks</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to fill the Ditch of the ſecond Wall in 48
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:39539:162"/>hours time, upon the aſſurance of a recompence of 4000 livers, which was promiſed them by the Generals. The breach which was made in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Wall was very ſpacious, and as ſoon as the Mines were finiſht, they will again aſſault the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond wall. They found much difficulty in the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varian</hi> attack to render themſelves maſters of the Caſtles, by reaſon of the various Walls and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which were to be forced, and of the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Defendants. This obliged the Elector to redouble the fire of his Cannon to throw down theſe Walls, and in effect they did little elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides beating the Caſtle from their ſeveral batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which plai'd upon the Flanks and Curtains with ſo much fury, that they hop'd in a few days to ſee them quite down. Thirty <hi>Huſſars</hi> meeting with as many of the <hi>Turks,</hi> killed one of them, and took 4 Priſoners, which they brought with them to the Camp. Amongſt theſe was an <hi>Aga,</hi> who four years ſince was ranſomed out of <hi>Raab,</hi> where he had been Priſoner, for 8000 Crowns. Theſe reported that the <hi>6th</hi> inſtant the <hi>Seraſquier</hi> ſhould arrive at <hi>Alb-Royal</hi> with 26000 Horſe, and was to be followed by the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled his Army about <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> which was not to be inferiour in number to that which was laſt year imployed at the Siege of <hi>Gran.</hi> They added, that the Seraskier had expreſs Orders not to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a battel with the Chriſtians, for fear of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the City and Army at once, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to put Supplies of Troops in the beſieged Town one way or other, or to periſh in the attempt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 8. Four thouſand <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Horſe appeared upon a Hill near the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> quarter, and retired after ſome light Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes with Count <hi>Budiani</hi>'s <hi>Huſſars,</hi> reinforced by ſome commanded Men and Voluntiers. The Priſoners taken there depoſed, that the <hi>Seraskier</hi> was camped under the Cannon of <hi>Alba-Regalis</hi> with 20000 Combatants, and that the Grand Viſier with the Grand Army was expected there; but the Duke, by the report of his Spies and Scouts knew that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whether he ought to proceed with all the Army, or continue about the bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> with a great part of his Forces, capable to oppoſe the <hi>Croats,</hi> which might ruine the ſaid bridge, if he abandoned it, and ſo cut off his retreat. The mines in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack would be ready in two days. The fortification of the Camp was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, as alſo the perpetual diſcharge of the Cannon and Mortars againſt the beſieged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 9. Some thouſands of <hi>Turks</hi> poſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not far from the Camp, in an advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous place, as if they deſigned to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there for ſome attempt; but the Generals had taken ſuch good meaſures, they apprehended nothing, and the Souldiers ſeemed full of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. All the retrenchments about the Camp were near finiſhed, but being the <hi>Turks</hi> did frequently alarm them, the Duke ordered, that all the Foot that were not in the Approaches, ſhould be placed in the Lines, and particularly in the Spurs. This morning, a Bomb from the Town falling unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily into a reſerve of Granado's, fired them, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling 3, and wounding 13. This evening ſome <hi>Turks</hi> did again appear upon an eminence to the right behind the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Camp, towards which two Squadrons of them did move in good order, to brave the Beſiegers, but ſome Voluntiers riding out to pickeer with them, they retired with the loſs only of one man ſlain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 10. The Imperialiſts continued the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Mine, the two others of the two other Attacks being ready. The Duke cauſed the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garian</hi> Foot to be poſted along the Wall of the lower Town, from the Water Rondel to the very quarters of the <hi>Germans,</hi> where they intrenched themſelves with a Ditch and a good Parapet to ſecure them againſt ſurpriſes; and as the <hi>Danube</hi> is deep there, they ſunk two Barks full of ſtones, and made ſeveral Spurs of Paliſado's along the brink of the River, to take away all hopes of the <hi>Turks</hi> relieving of the Town that way. This morning the Infidels gave another alarm on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> quarters, whereupon all the Cavalry was commanded to Horſe, but the Enemy retired at the ſame time. It ſeems that their deſign was to make a paſſage that way, but the <hi>Bavarians</hi> were ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intrenched to hinder them. The Prince of <hi>Croy</hi> being recovered of his wounds, did reaſſume the exerciſe of his charge in the approaches. Four <hi>Huſſars</hi> very well mounted, advancing againſt ſome <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Horſe of the place, made as if they would charge them, but being come up with them they diſcourſed them and ſhook hands together, which being obſerved by the Musketiers of a neighbouring Redoubt, they ſallied out and gave fire upon the <hi>Huſſſars,</hi> who ran away, hurt one, which they took, as alſo another of them, the third got away, and the fourth entered into the City. The Priſoners were examined, who ſaid they did nothing but enquire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> if they would not yet ſurrender the place, but they were to be interrogated more ſtrictly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 11. Some <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Troops did again ſhew themſelves upon the Mountains on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide towards the way of <hi>Alb-Royal.</hi> The preciſe number of the <hi>Turks</hi> is not yet known, ſome Spies certifie that there are 40000 <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and 20000 <hi>Tartars.</hi> In the mean time every neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is put in practice to receive them, if they will attempt to force the Camp. Preparations are made for a vigorous aſſault upon the ſecond wall, if the Mines will anſwer expectation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. All things being ready for the aſſault, the three Mines on the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack were fired, which had no other ſucceſs than the turning up of a few Paliſades, the Miners not having pierced deep enough under the Wall of the ſecond Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, which made it evident that they did not well underſtand their trade, although they had been ſent for from all quarters, to have good ones, for they were the Mines that contributed the moſt to the reducing of this important place. The aſſault that was deſigned if the Mines had taken, was deferred, and new ones were gone in hand with, in hopes of more favourable ſucceſs. In the skirmiſhes of this day, there was an Officer of the <hi>Turks</hi> killed, who doubtleſs had engaged himſelf to enter into the place, being they found Letters about him to the Baſſa of <hi>Buda,</hi> marking the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Turks were to obſerve to relieve the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged; by which it appeared, that the Grand Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier's deſign was to force a quarter, and ſo put in a Supply into the place without hazarding a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; and that 8000 <hi>Tartars</hi> ſhould haraſs the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as far as <hi>Gran,</hi> to cut off proviſions from the Beſiegers, and infeſt them with continual courſes. Upon this advice the Duke called a Council of War, where it was reſolved, to leave part of the Army in guard againſt the Town, and to march with the reſt of the Imperial and Auxiliary For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the Enemy, who according to the ſaid Letters were above 60000 ſtrong, although they had it from good hands, that they did not exceed 40000 Combatants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 13. The whole Army marched out of the Lines the night paſt, except 20000 left there for the Guard of the Works, and to hinder the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from putting Supplies into the Place. Oats and Forage were diſtributed for three days for the Horſe, and the <hi>Volunteers</hi> were formed into a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:39539:162"/>fine Body under good Officers. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> poſted himſelf out of the Camp in ſight of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, 4000 <hi>Huſſars</hi> and <hi>Heyducks</hi> having the Avant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. This night the <hi>Spies</hi> and ſome Deſerters aſſured them, that the following night they would be attacked in Battel-array upon break of day, which obliged the Chriſtians to diſpoſe of all things for the Battel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 14. The <hi>Turks</hi> before Sun-riſing formed a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of more than 8000 <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Spahi's,</hi> the moſt brave and moſt reſolute of the Army, who being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into divers Troops, marched from 6 in the Morning till 8 a clock, curvetting behind the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains on the ſide of <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> and entered into a Plain the better to approach the Camp by the favour of a Valley. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having obſerved the Enemies countenance, commanded Count <hi>Dune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald,</hi> General of the Horſe, to take poſſeſſion of the ground to the left with nine Imperial Regiments, Cuiraſiers, Dragoons, and Croats, to which he added ſome Companies of <hi>Huſſars;</hi> and General <hi>Heuſler</hi> had order to poſt himſelf with his Detachment upon the height on the right. The <hi>Huſſars</hi> who were with Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Dunewald</hi> charg'd firſt, and tho' they fought with all imaginable bravery, they were notwithſtanding forced to give way, but ſeeing themſelves ſupported by the <hi>Germans,</hi> they took heart and returned to the Charge again. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſeeing they had routed the <hi>Huſſars,</hi> thought to have had the others as good cheap; upon theſe hopes, they advanced with great fury and horrible cries againſt the Chriſtians, who received them without moving. <hi>Heuſler,</hi> who had placed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the height mentioned, charged them ſmart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that the fight was rude and bloudy, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Turks</hi> ſaw themſelves charged in their Flanks and Front, they did not deſiſt to make uſe of ſeveral efforts to break through the Enemy, and have room to execute their deſign, but all was in vain, being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time repulſed, until they were at length broke and forced to fly. The execution was bloudy. The Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries being abandoned by the <hi>Spahi's,</hi> and environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Enemies, throwing away their Arms, ſought to ſave themſelves by flight, but were moſt of them ſlain. The <hi>Turks</hi> had above 3000 dead, moſt of them Janizaries, all choſen men, who had underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to force a quarter, and enter into the City, or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had promiſed 20 Ducats to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that ſhould enter into the City, whereof he gave each undertaker 5 in hand: every one carried beſides his ordinary arms 3 Hand-Granado's, a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tock and Spade, to break the Retrenchments and fill the Ditches. The Priſoners were 500, there being alſo taken 30 Enſigns and Standards, 11 Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and 10 Waggons loaden with Ammunition. This great action coſt the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> but little, the ſlain not exceeding 60, and the wounded but 33. After this fight the <hi>Turks</hi> made ſeveral movements, and drew up in a Plain which lookt towards the <hi>Bavari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> quarter, and keeping their Wings upon heights, they made meen as if they would come to a deciſive battel, or relieve the Place with all their Forces. Hereupon a Council of War was called, where it was reſolved to follow the Enemy, which was done by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> in the head of his Army, but the <hi>Turks</hi> apprehending an Engagement, retired. The Generals <hi>Dunewald</hi> and <hi>Heuſler</hi> purſued them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Mountains, and the <hi>Huſſars</hi> had another skirmiſh with a great Party of <hi>Turks</hi> which ſtayed behind to amuſe the Chriſtians, and favour the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of their Army. The booty the Chriſtians got was conſiderable, for they had all the ſpoil of the Enemy, whereof there was not one that had not the 5 Duckets which the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had given him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his own moneys. The Beſieged thinking they were already relieved, made great fire upon them that kept the Approaches, and ſuppoſed they might ruine ſome of the Enemies works, but in vain, for they were ſo briskly received, that they loſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of risking further. They however made a very furious ſally on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, which was fatal to them, for they were not only repelled by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of <hi>Baden</hi> and <hi>Aſpremont,</hi> but the retreat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cut off, there was great ſlaughter made of them. The Turks being retired without coming to a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive battel, the Army returned into their Lines, and immediately diſpatched young Count <hi>Palſi</hi> to the <hi>Emperour</hi> with the news of this great advantage, and to lay 28 Colours and Standards at his feet, that were taken in the late engagement. The reſt, for ſome were taken in the purſuit, were planted upon the great Rondel, to make the Beſieged comprehend the defeat of thoſe Succours that they had expected with ſo much impatience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 15. The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Huſſars</hi> ſcouting abroad brought ſome Priſoners in, who all agreed in this, that the Grand Viſier notwithſtanding this check, would not deſiſt making other attempts to put relief into the Town, tho' with the hazard of his whole Army. And in effect, however he was retired, he did not ceaſe to alarm the Camp every night. This Afternoon a ſignal was made to the Beſieged for a Parley, to inform them by the Janizaries Priſoners of the rout of their Succours; but whether they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this within or not, they anſwered by the fire of their great and ſmall ſhot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 16. The works of the three Attacks were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with vigour, and in the Morning the Beſieged's Palizadoes and Defences of Wood upon the Breach were fired in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack, and partly conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Flames, notwithſtanding all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Turks to extinguiſh them. In this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they threw a prodigious quantity of Stones, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, Sacks with Powder, and other combuſtible matters upon the Aſſailants, inſomuch that four of them who fired them were burnt, twelve Crowns a man being given to each of thoſe who engaged themſelves in this Service as a recompence, and yet they could not clear the way for an Aſſault, the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged having taken their time in the Night to plant other Palizadoes and repair their Defences. In the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack, the Caſtle and the great Tower were inceſſantly beaten, which were as it were overturn'd by the force of the Cannon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 17. All things were ready for the Aſſault in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack, but the Beſieged having repaired their Defences, and planted double rows of Paliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does behind thoſe that were burnt yeſterday, they were obliged to defer it. The Priſoners that the <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> brought to the Camp reported, that the Grand Viſier was extreamly in choler againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Spahi's,</hi> for not having done his duty in the fight on the <hi>14th</hi> inſtant, by abandoning the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and added, that of the ten thouſand men which were appointed for that enterpriſe, but very few returned to the Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 18. The two great Mines in the <hi>Lorrain</hi> At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack were fired, but neither with that Succeſs that the Miners had promiſed, which extremely retarded the Reduction of this important Place. The Duke ſeeing they advanced but little by Mining, reſolved on Sapping, for which end, preparation of Faggots and Sacks of Earth were made to fill the Ditch, and certain Engines were deviſed to approach the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with leſs peril, and drive them from their Poſt. A new Battery was raiſed on the right to beat down the Beſiegeds flanks of Palizadoes on the Breach; and to do it more effectually they were to ſhoot from the Battery on the Curtain with chained Bullets. A Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive from the Turkiſh Army reported amongſt other things, that the Grand Viſier was encamped at preſent at <hi>Ertſchin,</hi> 4 Leagues from the City, but that he would not deſiſt from attempting the relief of the Place, being only removed to that diſtance for want of Forrage. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> ſeized a Country Fellow who had ſwum the <hi>Danube,</hi> having Letters from the Governour to the Grand Viſier and the Aga of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> in which he <hi>conjures them by the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:39539:163"/>Law of</hi> Mahomet <hi>to ſuccour him, adding he would expect the laſt extremity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 19. The Beſieged defending themſelves with obſtinate Valour, ſpent this whole day in thundring with their Artillery upon the new <hi>Lorrain</hi> Battery, which had been raiſed to beat upon the flanks of the Palizadoes, and whereon they had mounted 4 great Guns, which they ſo ruined that it was rendred uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for the preſent. The Detachments from the Grand Viſiers Army continued to alarm the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Camp every Night, who to prevent Surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, were continually upon their Guard. General <hi>Scherfenberg</hi> was expected in few days with thoſe Troops he commanded in <hi>Tranſilvania.</hi> As ſoon as this body was arriv'd, they pretended to go and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the Grand Viſier in his Camp, who by report of Priſoners and Run-aways, did not exceed 46000 men, whereof half were new raw Fellows without Diſcipline or Order. Strong parties were every day ſent out to obſerve the Enemies Countenance, who often ſhock with theirs, but always with Advantage.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 20. The Grand Viſier reſolved to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt to introduce Supplies into <hi>Buda,</hi> would do it with fewer Troops than before, the better to paſs undiſcover'd, and be able to approach the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Camp. He choſe for this purpoſe the braveſt Officers in his Army, who promiſed to execute his order or periſh. They began their march in the Night with 2000 <hi>Spahis,</hi> and the like number of <hi>Janizaries,</hi> who were mounted for the greater Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, and this Morning at break of day they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the Valley of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where having been put in order without being perceived, ruſhed, as their manner is, with great Cryes upon the firſt Guard, which they defeated eaſie enough, and forced upon two ſquadrons of Horſe of <hi>Caprara</hi> and <hi>Heuſlers,</hi> who received them courageouſly, giving others time to haſten to their aſſiſtance, and chaſe the Turks, who fled. The <hi>Janizaries,</hi> whereof part had quitted their Horſes with deſign to traverſe the Trenches, and get into the City, were ill treated, they were purſued by General <hi>Heuſler</hi> to the very Gate, and met by the Guard of <hi>Bavarian</hi> Horſe, who haſtned to the allarm, ſo that their ſlaughter was there very great, and few had the fortune to enter into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and though ſome make them amount to 150, they were ſcarce 100 that got in, which may be eaſily judged by the abandoned Horſes, which did not ſurpaſs the ſaid number, ſo that this feeble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply was of no great uſe to the Beſieged, and if thoſe of the advanced Guard had done their duty, not one of them had paſſed the Trenches. The Turks had 400 ſlain, and the Chriſtians not above 15; and 26 hurt. General <hi>Heuſler,</hi> who behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his accuſtomed Gallantry, was hurt in the foot, but not dangerouſly. General <hi>Maigret</hi> was handled worſe, being ſeverely ſabled, and Marquis <hi>Santini,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> was taken Priſoner in the firſt heat of the fight. The Beſieged, to teſtifie their Joy for the arrival of theſe Succours, flouriſhed three red Colours in token of Victory, and fired three <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vos</hi> with all their Artillery and ſmall ſhot, which gave the Beſiegers a gueſs at the ſmallneſs of their number, which the Renegadoes yet affirm ſurpaſs the number of 2000 ſerviceable men. During the late ſhock, ſome ſquadrons of thoſe of the Grand Viſier, who had followed the other to ſecond them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in Battalia towards the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack, as if deſigning to try their fortune that way, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired without engaging: and yet they returned about ten at night to the ſame place they had attempted the paſſage that morning, but they were repelled, and retreated in diſorder. In the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack there was a new Battery raiſed of four Pieces: and the beſieged mounted a great Gun upon the high wall of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> with which they beat all the covered way, as alſo the Battery of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> upon the great Rondel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 21. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> cauſed 5000 <hi>Tartars</hi> to paſs the <hi>Danube,</hi> who ravag'd the other ſide of the River, and incommoded the adverſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers by their courſes; All things are in abundance in the Camp, and the Convoys arrive there ſecurely by Water. General <hi>Scherfenberg</hi> is expected in 7 or 8 days with 10000 men, having orders to mount his Foot in Charets, for fear of tiring them with ſo long a march. Twelve hundred <hi>Suediſh</hi> Foot are likewiſe expected, being the remainder of the Troops which the <hi>King of Sweden</hi> is obliged to ſend, to aſſiſt the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> againſt the <hi>Infidels,</hi> upon account of his <hi>quota</hi> for thoſe Fiefs which he poſſeſſes in <hi>Germany.</hi> This morning a Redoubt was built in that place which the <hi>Turks</hi> forced yeſterday; it was further fortified with two pieces of Cannon, and Troops capable to defend the paſſage. There was alſo another Redoubt built on the Mountain on the left, where the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Lodron</hi> was camped. This day the Beſieged did yet give ſome Volleys of rejoycing, whereof the reaſon is not known, unleſs it be ſome particular feaſt. The <hi>Sieur Rummel,</hi> General of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops, being in the approaches, was ſlain there with a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet bullet. He is much regretted, having diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed himſelf in all the occaſions where he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 22. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> cauſed the great Tower to be aſſaulted, which is in the middle of the Caſtle, and for the moſt part ruined by his Cannon. He took it with the loſs of 73 Soldiers, and the like number wounded, amongſt which, the Duke of <hi>Saxe-Mersburg</hi> was hurt in two places. Whilſt this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault laſted, there was a falſe alarm given on the <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> ſide to divert the enemy, and much firing there was with Cannon to ruine the Defences which they had made upon the breaches of the inner Wall. This evening about 10 a clock, a Turk, who had ſwum the River, was taken near the Iſle of <hi>St. Margaret,</hi> he had thrown his Letters into the water, and yet confeſſed that he had been ſent by the Baſſa, to give advice to the Grand Seignior of the ſtate of the place, and preſs for relief: adding, that another was alſo gone with the ſame condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 23. The beſieged made an attempt upon the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Attack, to recover the great Tower of the Caſtle, which they had yeſterday loſt by aſſault, but they were repelled and beat back to their Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At the <hi>Lorrain</hi> Attack four pieces were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the great old Battery, wherewith they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to batter the new Paliſades upon the Breach of the inner Wall. The Night paſt the Beſieged ſallied upon the <hi>Saxon</hi>'s quarter, but they were ſo well recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and repulſed by Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Pletze,</hi> who was upon the Guard with 100 horſe, that they had much to do to recover their ſecond Wall, where this Officer was ſlain with two Musket-ſhot, and the <hi>Turks</hi> had yet the leiſure to drag his Corps into the City.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. The <hi>Turks</hi> appeared in two ſeparate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the one at the <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the other at the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> attack, but without attempting any thing, and retired about noon into their Camp, which they had advanced a League nearer the Chriſtians than they were before. A Renegado out of Town reported, that the Beſieged began to ſpeak with more licentiouſneſs againſt the Baſſa, who endeavoured to keep them to their duty, telling them, that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> expected one of the firſt Miniſters of State from the Port, with full power from the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> to treat and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace with the Generals of the Chriſtians, and that upon his arrival there would be a ſuſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms; exhorting them not to degenerate from the bravery and vertue of true <hi>Muſſelmen,</hi> whoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they had hitherto ſo generouſly ſupported, but to expect yet ſome few days before they talked of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 25. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> being advertiſed, that the <hi>Turks</hi> might contrive a paſſage on the <hi>Danube</hi> ſide, behind the hot Baths, to put Succours into the Town, ordered ſome Squadrons of Horſe to ſecond
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:39539:163"/>the Guards, which were at the ſame time reinforced, and to the end the acceſs might be rendred the more difficult for the <hi>Turks,</hi> he cauſed Paliſado's to be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the moſt weak places, and cauſed ſome Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons and Battalions of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Hungarians</hi> to be poſted in ſuch manner, that if the <hi>Turks</hi> would make ſome other attempt, they might eaſily be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and haſten to the Alarm. Some change was alſo made in two Batteries, the better to incommode the Beſieged, and deſtroy their Parapets, Paliſado's, and other defences which they had rais'd upon the breach of the inner Wall. In the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack they got ground foot by foot, ſo that they will in a little time be Maſters of all the Caſtle, notwithſtanding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the braveſt Enemy imaginable, who never loſe an inch of ground without diſputing it, and endeavour to recover it by often repriſals, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe for this purpoſe of Bombs, Granado's, Stones, Sacks with Powder, Stink-Pots, and other arts which courage and deſpair are capable of inventing to break the meaſures of the Agreſſors, and obſtruct their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and as they have made divers holes and caverns under the places, in poſſeſſion of the Chriſtians, by which they play theſe ſorts of inventions, the other were conſtrained to fill them with earth, ſtones, and the very ruines of the Caſtle, to damp and hinder their operation, without which they could not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves, but with great difficulty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 26. The Priſoners brought in the Camp by Parties, and the Deſerters which ran away reported, that one of thoſe which was ſent to the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> by the Baſſa of <hi>Buda</hi> with Diſpatches, in which he gave him an account of the ſtate of the place, which he can no more defend at preſent, that the Caſtle is well-nigh all in the hands of the Chriſtians, who on the firſt aſſault cannot fail to carry the place. That in the laſt aſſault of the Caſtle he had loſt more than 100 of his beſt Soldiers, that the Recruits that were ſent him were but little conſiderable, not mounting to 200 men, amongſt which, more than half were wounded, and conſequently unſerviceable. That for his part he had acquitted himſelf of his duty, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Chriſtians ſee, that after a defence ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, during ſo long a Siege, puſhed on with ſo much fury and bravery both on the one ſide and the other, that the <hi>Muſſelmen</hi> knew well how to ſupport the cauſe of their <hi>Sultan,</hi> in doing whereof he pretended to his ſhare of glory, profeſſing finally that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ought to give an account of the ill ſucceſs of the Siege, and be reſponſible for a loſs ſo conſiderable, which he could not avoid, if the Imperialiſts attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted another aſſault, no more than the bloud of his valorous Soldiers, and his own, if he delayed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief any longer. The Baſſa did further mark the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in his Letter, which appear'd to him the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to attempt the relief by, and if he took his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures well, that he would ſucceed in his enterpriſe. Upon this advice the Duke viſited in perſon the place marked to the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> and gave orders for every thing to hinder the introducing of ſupplies. The Spies which were ſent to the Enemies Camp, reported, that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had again promiſed 40 Crowns a man to all them who would undertake to put themſelves into the place, promiſing moreover that they ſhould be exempt from the War during their lives, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their ordinary pay without the obligation of any ſervice. At noon advice was given that the <hi>Turks</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with 12 great pieces of Cannon, and a while after they were perceived in ſight of the Camp ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in order of Battel, but as the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Army to fight, they retired.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 27. The <hi>Lorrainers</hi> having finiſhed their work in form of a Bridg, it was extended to the adverſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſades to be made uſe of in the aſſault. It was covered with earth to ſecure it from the fire, as had been done the day before in the <hi>Bavarian</hi> attack, which had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſaid <hi>Bavarians</hi> to retire, but this morning they recovered their Poſt again, and to ſecure them from the fire, they made uſe of Planks covered with Tin, and yet when they thought themſelves ſafe from this devouring Element, the Beſieged, who want no indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry to their valour, threw towards evening an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe quantity of artificial and combuſtible matters with that ſucceſs, that they pierced even to the ſaid Planks, and reduced them to aſhes; they alſo flung ſuch a vaſt quantity of Granado's, Stones and Arrows upon the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> that they forced them to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this Poſt with the loſs of twenty Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 28. In the <hi>Lorrain</hi> attack, they thundred with extreme violence from their Cannon upon the Flanks of the great Breach, as did alſo the <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> to overthrow the Beſieged's defences. The <hi>Bavarians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained their Poſt, and covered themſelves ſo well in it, that the Enemy would be much troubled to diſlodg them. Major <hi>Staben,</hi> who commanded the Aſſailants, was killed there, the ſlain and wounded not otherwiſe exceeding 20. Upon the Report of ſome Renegado's that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> was reſolved to come this Night with all his Forces, the Duke ordered all things for his reception, and all the Army ſtood in Battalia, but to no purpoſe, for no Enemy did appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. Being the Decollation of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and a day which the <hi>Turks</hi> have always ſuperſtitiouſly obſerv'd as fortunate to their Empire, 1000 <hi>Spahi's</hi> and 2000 <hi>Janizaries</hi> commanded by two Baſſa's, and ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by 1500 <hi>Tartars,</hi> came at break of day to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other trial on the Water ſide, but ſeeing the Poſt too well provided on that quarter, having received a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the Musketeers that kept the Walls, they retreated, and judged it eaſier to try the paſſage by the ſame way that the laſt Supplies entred; they went by the Valley of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and charged fiercely with their accuſtomed ſhouts upon the Regiments of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Heuſler,</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> who received them with ſo much bravery, that they killed a great number of them, whereof ſome of the moſt determined were raſh enough to puſh through to the very Lines, where they were all ſlain except 4, who were lucky enough to get into the City. The number of the dead in this action amounted to 600, beſides the Priſoners, which were not many; and there were taken 25 Standards and Colours which were red, intimating thereby, that they would enter the City or periſh. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide ſome 30 were killed and wounded, <hi>Mercy</hi> was of the number of the laſt, but without danger, and his Adjoutant of the firſt. During this Tentative the Beſieged made a ſally upon the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> but the <hi>Heyducks</hi> attacking them in Flank, they had much a-do to retire, leaving 17 dead upon the place. The <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> ſhewed himſelf with his Army all day on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide, ready to engage, but ſeeing 3 Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Cuiraſiers, and two of Dragoons, being the Avant-Guard of General <hi>Scherfenberg</hi>'s Army, he quickly retreated back to his Camp.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 30. <hi>Scherfenberg</hi> arrived this day with the reſt of his Body, proper men, who ſeem'd eager to ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize themſelvs. The Deſerters reported, that the want was great in the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi>'s Army, and that the famiſhed Soldiers had plundered ſome Barks which had brought Proviſions, the Officers not being able to hinder them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 31. The <hi>Lorrainers</hi> took a new Poſt in the Ditch before the Breach in the inner Wall, but 3 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom diſtant from the Palliſade, and the place being very deep, the Turks could not much hurt them, where they had but 2 Soldiers wounded. This Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> went, accompanied with moſt of the Generals, to the Elector's quarters, where they held a Council of War, and having dined there, the Duke returned to his Quarters, after which, the Works were ordered to be enlarged and deepned for the eaſier aſcent to the Aſſault, which was reſolved upon in a day or two.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. Three thouſand <hi>Turks</hi> appeared before day by Moon-light on the <hi>Bavarian</hi> ſide, but ſeeing the Chriſtians in good order and ready to receive them,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:39539:164"/>they retired without any Engagement. The Great Chancellor, Count <hi>Straatman,</hi> being arrived yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day at the Camp with a ſecret Commiſſion, called a Council of War, in which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and all the Imperial and Auxiliary Generals did meet. The Chancellor expoſed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which contained his <hi>Imperial Majeſtie</hi>'s deſires to put an end to this bloody Siege, and that they ſhould conſult on the means the moſt proper and expedient for the terminating of it. Two points were chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated upon, whether they ſhould go with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the Army, leaving a ſufficient number to guard the Lines, to force the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> or ſhould make a General aſſault upon the place, and that with more Forces than had hitherto been employed. The later was approved by moſt of the Generals, and it was reſolved to aſſault the place the next day, for which purpoſe every thing that was neceſſary was prepared, that the enterpriſe might not fail: and leſt the Enemy might know it, it was given out, that they would the next day go and fight the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> which cauſed great joy amongſt the Officers and Souldiers, deſirous of ſignalizing themſelves. The Cannon of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks were in the mean time imployed to inlarge the Breaches, and caſt down the Enemies fences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 2. All the Generals mounted on Horſeback, and the Troops put themſelves in order to quit the Lines, and go to their place of Arms, and march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> making as if they would go and attack them in their Camp. The Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> viſited their Quarters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragaing the Officers and Souldiers to maintain the cauſe of God, and the Glory of the Emperour. The Infantry was ranged into Battalions whilſt the firing in the three attacks was redoubled, and a vaſt quantity of Bombs and chained Bullets were ſhot againſt the beſiegeds defences, which were for the moſt part thrown down; and as the Troops were put in order to march towards the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> the motion of the Vanguard was inſtantly changed, and at three in the Afternoon the Infantry that compoſed the Rear-guard was commanded to mount to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, which was done in the three differing attacks of <hi>Lorrain, Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> beſides which there were two falſe attacks to divert the Enemy. And however that all imaginary precautions were put in uſe to render the aſſault eaſie, they encountred ſo brave a defence in the beſieged, that they had much ado to ſurmount them; they defended themſelves for three quarters of an hour with Halbirds, Half-Pikes, Partizans, and threw ſuch a vaſt number of Stones, Arrows, and Granades, that they repulſed the Aſſailants more than once, until the Chriſtians, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the preſence of their Generals, returning with greater force, rendred themſelves at length Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Breach in all the three attacks. The <hi>Turks</hi> defended themſelves by retiring from Retrenchment to Retrenchment, ſo that the ſlaughter was very bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and to conclude, the beſieged being beaten from all their fences, the Aſſailants entred by force into the City, ran thro' the ſtreets, killed all they met with, ſparing neither Sex nor Age, ſo that all was filled with the dead bodies of theſe Infidels. The <hi>Bavarians,</hi> in purſuit of their point, attack'd 1000 <hi>Turks,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into a Redoubt at the foot of the Caſtle, where they defended themſelves with extream Obſtinacy, until deſpairing of their ſafety, they hungout a white Flag, and demanded quarter; but as they had ſlain many of the Aggreſſors, and had reſiſted two whole hours without ſubmitting, the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> were of Opinion they ſhould have no quarter given them; but conſidering their number, that they might yet do much harm, that the Night was coming on, and that the Souldiers were wearied, and ought to reſt, that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> was not far off with a formidable Army, and that the fire was in ſeveral parts of the City, reducing all to Aſhes; it was reſolved they ſhould have their Lives given them; which being notified to them, they, miſerable Bravos, threw down their Arms. There were about 1000 more, who being retired into Cellars and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns obtained the ſame grace. The number of the ſlain amounted to 3000 beſides the wounded, who were but few, ſo that the Garriſon was ſtronger than it had been reported by the fugitives to have been.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdi</hi> Baſſa died bravely in the Breach, where he fought valiantly with his Sable in his hand, without giving back or demanding quarter, not to degenerate from the glory and heroick Vertue of the antient <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans,</hi> nor falſifie the Oath which he made to the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to preſerve him the place, or to end his days gloriouſly in it. The <hi>Vice</hi> Baſſa is alſo an Officer of great reputation, he had defended the Caſtle, and ſeeing that all was loſt, retired fighting into the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned Redoubt at the foot of the Caſtle, where he thought to hold it out, and give the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> lieſure to come and relieve him; but ſeeing that all was deſperate, he choſe rather to implore the Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Conquerours, than ſuffer himſelf and thoſe that were with him to be maſſacred without any advantage to his party, and ſo he was made a Priſoner with thoſe with him, by the <hi>Bavarians.</hi> The <hi>Aga</hi> of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and ſome chief Officers fell to the Duke of <hi>Lorrains</hi> ſhare, ſo that the number of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners did not exceed 2000, of 13000 brave expert Souldiers, and the very Nerves of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, which were in the place at the beginning of the Siege. The Chriſtians loſs in this aſſault was inconſiderable, not above 400 ſlain, and half as many wounded, in which number were many Voluntiers, but few Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Collonel <hi>Spinola,</hi> an Officer of good merit, was kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at the head of the Aſſailants, and Baron <hi>Aſti,</hi> who had been twice already hurt during the Siege, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now a third, which was feared would prove fatal.</p>
                  <p>The plunder which the Souldiers got was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, the riches of this City were vaſtly great, which thoſe of the other Cities of <hi>Hungary</hi> under the domination of the <hi>Turks</hi> brought thither, as to a place of refuge and impregnable. There were found Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Proviſions ſufficient for two Months longer. The Arſenal was full of all ſorts of offenſive and defenſive Arms to arm 30000 men, Harneſſes, Saddles, Boots, and other equipage for Horſes, beſides 400 pieces of Cannon and Mortars, whereof 170 were mounted, and no way prejudiced. It is impoſſible to particularize every thing, it may ſuffice to ſay, that a City could not be better furniſhed to ſupport a Siege vigorouſly than this was, nor defended by a more brave Garriſon. But if the oppoſition hath been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, ſo much greater is the glory of thoſe brave Officers, Voluntiers, and Souldiers that ſignalized themſelves there in the forcing of it.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having put a ſtop to the ſlaughter, and ordered the Soldiers to return to their Colours, commanded the fire to be extinguiſhed, gave the command of the place to Baron <hi>Beck,</hi> till the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's pleaſure was known, with a Garriſon of 5000 Foot and 1000 Horſe. He farther commanded 10000 Horſe and Dragoons with <hi>Badiani's Huſſars</hi> to purſue the <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> who having ſeen the taking of <hi>Buda,</hi> diſcamped inſtantly with all his Army, to go cover the reſt of the Turkiſh Fortreſſes, put good Garriſons into them, and ſo ſecure the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> where it was reſolved to go and attack him, if they could not overtake him, for which end the Infantry was imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked upon the <hi>Danube</hi> for their eaſier tranſport, whilſt the Cavalry marched by Land.</p>
                  <p>And thus this great and ſtrong City, after 145 years of Bondage under the Turkiſh Yoak, was now at length, after having been ſix times beſieged in vain, taken, and reſtored to the dominion of the Emperor. It had been of great ſervice to the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> as being their principal place of Arms, from whence they ſent their Forces and Munitions of War into the other Cities and Fortreſſes of their obedience, for they ſtill kept there a numerous Garriſon of 8 or 10000 Jani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:39539:164"/>and Spahi's, as in a Nurſery, and ready upon all occaſions.</p>

                  <p>A Detachment, as we ſaid, of 10000 Horſe being ſent in purſuit of the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> by Land, and 12000 Foot, with 30 Cannon, Mortars, Ammunition, and all ſort of Proviſions, were ſent down the <hi>Danube</hi> in large Boats, with order to fortifie themſelves in ſome convenient Poſt near the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> whilſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were ſent to the Forces in <hi>Croatia</hi> to joyn them, in order to cut off the Enemies retreat. The main Army did alſo follow, but the want of Forrage in a waſted Country forced them to ſeparate, and to paſs the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome 12 Miles below <hi>Buda,</hi> with deſign to beſiege <hi>Segedin,</hi> whilſt the reſt continued their march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> and joyn with the <hi>Croatian</hi> Forces, a Party of which had inſulted and burnt the Town of <hi>Quinque Eccleſiae,</hi> or five Churches, forcing the <hi>Turks</hi> into the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> having cauſed a Bridge of Boats to be laid over the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Paxi,</hi> ſeveral Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Horſe were ſent out, who met with no Enemy, the Turks having abandoned the ſmall places they were poſſeſſed of on both ſides the River, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving removed their Cannon and ſtore, and laid theſe places in aſhes. Count <hi>Caprara</hi> is deſigned to beſiege <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedin,</hi> but the deſign upon the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> could not be executed at this time, the Countrey being ſo extremely ruined, that the Troops were not able to ſubſiſt in their march thither. The <hi>Turks</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe abandoned <hi>Tuln</hi> and <hi>Hatwan,</hi> the Garriſon of the laſt being removed to <hi>Erlaw</hi> or <hi>Agria,</hi> after it had been moſt miſerably deſtroyed. The Duke, upon freſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> had not paſſed the <hi>Bridge of Eſſeck</hi> as was reported, but had poſted himſelf very ſtrongly and advantageouſly on this ſide, with 20000 men, ſeemed to alter his mind, and to go and beat up his Quarters, before he were further recruited from <hi>Belgrade.</hi> He had put 8000 of his beſt men into <hi>Alba Regalis,</hi> having given a Horſe to every Janizary, the better to make excurſions upon the Chriſtians in the Winter. Prince <hi>Lewis of Baden</hi> was detached from the main Army, with 12 Regiments of Horſe and Foot, to go and beſiege <hi>Five-Churches,</hi> but the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were ſo taken, that he might joyn his Forces to the Duke's in caſe it were requiſite, or that the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> might be brought to a battel. He was encamped near the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> having the Fortreſs of <hi>Darda</hi> behind him the <hi>Danube</hi> on his right, and the Hills on his left, and his Front covered with the River <hi>Sarwitz,</hi> over which the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> had cauſed Bridges to be laid, to oblige the <hi>Turks</hi> to repaſs the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> or to ſtand a Battel. But the ſeaſon being too far advanced, he encamped at <hi>Tuln,</hi> and paſſing no farther, leaving part of the Army under <hi>Caprara,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Danube</hi> in order to the Siege of <hi>Segedin,</hi> he returned towards <hi>Buda,</hi> and being encamped with 10 Regiments not far from <hi>Peſt,</hi> ſent a Party to poſſeſs themſelves of <hi>Hatwan,</hi> intirely ruined, tho' the <hi>Turks</hi> had left 17 Pieces of Cannon, which they wanted time and conveniencies to carry away. The reſidue of the Foot were put into <hi>Buda</hi> to reinfore that place, weakened by the departure of the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Troops, whilſt the Duke himſelf after ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Campain returned into <hi>Germany.</hi> The remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Horſe and Dragoons were ſent under General <hi>Veterani</hi> to reinforce the <hi>Imperial</hi> Forces before <hi>Segedin,</hi> upon advice that <hi>Achmet Baſſa</hi> was marching with a Body of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> to relieve it. General <hi>Wallis,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> hearing the Infidels advanced towards him, ordered Major General <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terani</hi> to march towards night with 7 Regiments of Horſe, the <hi>Croats</hi> of <hi>Lodron,</hi> and the Dragoons of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelli</hi> and <hi>Magne,</hi> which they did, and at break of day ſurpriſing the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Oct. 20. 1686.</note> eaſily routed them; nor did the <hi>Turks</hi> make any conſiderable reſiſtance, the ſpirit of that People formerly ſo martial, being actuated by ſuch a current of misfortunes into deſpondency. The Chriſtians, being upon their return to their Camp with their ſpoil, were attacked by the <hi>Grand Viſier</hi> himſelf at the head of above 12000 <hi>Turks,</hi> but with equal ſucceſs, theſe being likewiſe utterly defeated, without any extraordinary combating. Twelve pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, and all their Baggage, with 3000 Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were taken. The ſlain were eſtimated above 2000. <hi>Segedin,</hi> ſeeing their relief defeated, capitulated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to march with what they could carry, except their Arms, to <hi>Temeſwar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Five Churches</hi> had not ſo good quarters.<note place="margin">Oct. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> They had quitted the Town upon the arrival of the Chriſtians, and retired into the Caſtle, but after 4 days battery, ſurrendred it at diſcretion, the Women only and Children being conducted to <hi>Valpo,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Baſſa,</hi> 600 Janizaries, and 2000 others fit to bear arms, were made Priſoners of War. The Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> having put a good Garriſon into the place, divided his Army into two Bodies, one march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with General <hi>Scherffenberg</hi> towards <hi>Syclos,</hi> deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after having made himſelf Maſter of that place, to march towards the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck.</hi> Nor did they of <hi>Syclos</hi> detend themſelves much better than the reſt, they only burnt the Town, not to keep the Caſtle ſcarce to terms of diſcretion. The Prince marched thence to <hi>Darda,</hi> which he, although it were ſtrong, being ſeated upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> and covering the Bridg on one ſide, found abandoned, the <hi>Turks</hi> being retired into <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> leaving only a few Horſe to obſerve the Enemy, who, upon their advance, fled immediately. The Prince, having taken poſſeſſion of <hi>Darda,</hi> ſent Parties out to burn the Bridg of <hi>Eſſeck</hi> with artificial fires, which they ſo happily executed, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Turks played upon them all the time with their Cannon from <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> that they quite deſtroyed the Bridge from <hi>Darda</hi> to the <hi>Drave,</hi> as likewiſe the Bridg of Boats which the <hi>Turks</hi> had over that River.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Baden,</hi> after this exploit,<note place="margin">No. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> marched back towards <hi>Capeſwar,</hi> with 1200 Priſoners of both Sexes and Ages, which place he purpoſed to poſſeſs, and had delivered upon demand, after which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved for his Winter Quarters. The <hi>Croats</hi> alſo that had hitherto joyned him, did likewiſe return home with Booty, and ſtore of Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>And this was the end of this famous Campain in <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſo glorious to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> ſo that theſe who uſed to give and ſell Peace at pleaſure formerly, became now earneſt Sollicitors themſelves for it, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a condition, that nothing but a ſpeedy Peace could reſtore them. The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> being ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, made ſeveral efforts to effectuate it. He had lately made Overtures to General <hi>Caraffa,</hi> who commanded the Imperial Forces in upper <hi>Hungary,</hi> but now Letters are ſent to Prince <hi>Herman of Baden,</hi> Preſident of the Council of War, telling him how deſirous the <hi>Port</hi> was of Peace, and with what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the Emperour it might be concluded in this Conjuncture; propoſing further, that a Place might be appointed for Plenipotentiaries on both ſides to meet, and that Paſſports might be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis no wonder the Turks were ſo earneſt for Peace, having been ſo unſucceſsful in War, and the diſorders it produced. 'Tis ſcarce imaginable what confuſion and terror the taking of <hi>Buda,</hi> and the ſlaughter of that Garriſon did produce through the whole Empire, eſpecially <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The People began to murmur, and the Chief of them to <hi>Cabal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople.</hi>
                     </note> which ſo ſtartled the <hi>Grand Seignior,</hi> that after having doubled his Guards, he ſent to them to know the meaning of their unuſual meeting; they anſwered, that ſeeing him and his Empire in ſuch danger, they thought it their duty to conſult together how they might preſerve both. They blamed the <hi>Mufti</hi> as an ill man, who had fomented the War, not without ſome reflection upon his Highneſs himſelf, as too
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:39539:165"/>intent upon his ſports, and too little mindful of this his chief City. The <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> thought it beſt to comply with theſe Reformers, in order to which he immediately depoſes and baniſhes the <hi>Mufti,</hi> chuſing <hi>Huſſan Effendi Codilisk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There was alſo a great Reform made in the Seraglio, with a Retrenchment of the falaries and perquiſites of the principal Officers of it. There was alſo an extraordinary Council held in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> to conſider of the way to put the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces, which are now extreamly broken, into a condition to oppoſe the further progreſs of the Chriſtian Arms. And being Mony is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ingredient, the <hi>Grand Seignior</hi> made offer of all his Treaſure to be imployed in the War. The <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi> Queen gave 4000 Purſes of 500 Crowns each, and the chief Officers of the <hi>Seraglio</hi> preſented great ſums. And yet all this cannot cure their fears, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Plague, ſweeping away 1000 a day in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Galata,</hi> to which Calamities the ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Proviſions may be added, occaſioned by the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> diſturbing the Commerce of the black Sea, and the Chriſtians that of the <hi>Alexandria</hi> and the Arches.</p>
                  <p>Nor was it with theſe hardſhips only that the <hi>Turks</hi> were to contend, they had yet no leſs powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the <hi>Poles</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe Hiſtories we have for method ſake referred to their proper Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

                     </note> and ſtronger than the laſt. Their Forces conſiſted of 20000 <hi>Poles</hi> 15000 <hi>Lituanians,</hi> and 10000 <hi>Coſſacks</hi> with a great train of Artillery, and being met at their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Rendezvouz</hi> at <hi>Trembowla,</hi> marched toward the <hi>Nie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> with the King at the head of them.

Theſe being finiſhed, he marched towards <hi>Jaſſi,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> to give the <hi>Hoſpodar</hi> an opportunity to joyn his Forces with him, as he had promiſed. But this Prince, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it too ſoon as yet to declare, retired upon the News he had of the <hi>Kings</hi> approaching, notwithſtanding the aſſurances his Majeſty had given him of his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Protection.

                  <p>Some <hi>Tartars</hi> taken by a party, reported, that the <hi>Seraskier</hi> had paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> near <hi>Axiopolis,</hi> with 15 or 16000 men, that he expected 6000 more, which when come up, he intended to march towards <hi>Beſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia</hi> to joyn the <hi>Tartars</hi> commanded by Sultan <hi>Nura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> reported to be 30000 ſtrong. The Armies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching each other occaſioned many encounters. The King continued his march on this ſide the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Prutti</hi> as far as <hi>Falfyn.</hi> The Court Marſhal, who commanded the Vauntguard of the Army, encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring with a party of <hi>Tartars</hi> of 8000, engaged them, both fighting with great Courage, but the <hi>Tartars</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtronger, preſſed hard upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> and had worſted them if they had not been ſuccour'd by ſome freſh Troops, who adding new Vigour to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, turned the Scales, forcing the <hi>Tartars</hi> to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly retreat, ſome hundreds of them were killed, and amongſt others a near Relation of Sultan <hi>Nura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi> for whoſe body he offered the liberty of 3 <hi>Poliſh</hi> Genlemen; ſome Priſoners were likewiſe taken, and one of the <hi>Chams</hi> Standards, nor was this ſucceſs blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, divers of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Officers and Souldiers being killed and wounded.</p>
                  <p>The King having cauſed a Bridge near that Place to be laid over the River, paſſed it with his Army, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing into a great Plain with a Reſolution to enter into the Country of <hi>Budriac.</hi> But the Troops ſuffer'd much by exceſſive heat, which had cauſed a great drought, and burnt up all the Graſs, ſo that the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were in great want of forrage. <hi>Chevalier Lubormiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ki</hi> had likewiſe an advantageous on ſet againſt the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> but the News of the <hi>Moldavians</hi> having contrary to their promiſe joyned the <hi>Tartars,</hi> did not pleaſe. Theſe were alſo reinforced with further Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Turks</hi> which had paſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Ken</hi> and <hi>Smil.</hi> Theſe <hi>Tartars</hi> had likewiſe taken a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of 200 Waggons that were going to the Army, and together with the <hi>Turks</hi> made an attempt upon the Chriſtian Camp it ſelf, but finding the Troops in a condition to receive them, they made what haſte they could to retire, tho' not without ſome loſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 4. The <hi>Poles</hi> obtained a Victory againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> of whom ſome thouſands were ſaid to be killed upon the place, and 300 taken, with ſeveral of their principal Officers, for which ſucceſs <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung at <hi>Lemberg.</hi> The <hi>Poles</hi> alſo had 1500 ſlain, and amongſt them divers Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. After this, the King, weary of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> moſt commonly fatal to the <hi>Poles,</hi> repaſſed the Forreſt of <hi>Buckovina,</hi> in order to put his Troops into Winter-Quarters. He had not only quitted <hi>Jaſſi,</hi> which had been in part deſtroyed by an accidental fire, but had alſo cauſed the ſeveral Forts which he had built to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Paſſages of the Forreſt to be demoliſhed; from whence People concluded, that the King had no deſign to return in haſte that way again, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt <hi>Caminiec,</hi> ſo ruinous to that ſide of his Kingdom, and into which the <hi>Turks</hi> had newly put 500 Waggons laden with Proviſions, the Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Horſe that was ſent to obſtruct their Paſſage coming too late. The Chriſtians being gon to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the main body of the <hi>Tartars</hi> did ſo too, but ſome parties of them had lately made an incurſion into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain</hi> and <hi>Podolia,</hi> where they did much miſchief. The <hi>Turks</hi> who ſerved this Campaign againſt the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:39539:165"/>
                     <hi>Poles,</hi> repaſſed the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpodar</hi> of <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> returned to <hi>Jaſſi,</hi> from whence he had fled.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Poles</hi> had been highly animated with the League Offenſive and Defenſive which they had made the beginning of this laſt Campaign with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> which, though it had been publiſhed with great ſolemnity on both ſides, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> have not yet performed any one thing that was ſtipulated on their ſide. The Great Dukes were obliged by this Treaty to employ their Forces this laſt Summer againſt the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to divert them from joyning with the <hi>Turks;</hi> nor did they advance a ſtep in it, though they now (the Campaign being paſt) ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to aſſure the King of their firm Reſolution to obſerve the Treaty of Confederacy ſo lately conclu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded at <hi>Moſcho,</hi> and yet they ſtart new points which do ſo far perplex the Court, that they begin to have a great Jealouſie that the <hi>Czars</hi> do not ſeriouſly mean to enter into the War.</p>
                  <p>Great were the Preparations the <hi>Venetians</hi> had made to carry on the War this Summer againſt the <hi>Ottomans,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Wars of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice. March</hi> 26.</note> which they had been ſo ſucceſsful in the laſt; and the fleet being now ready, ſailed from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Moroſini</hi> towards the <hi>Levant.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Turks</hi> having got an Army together compoſed of 10000 foot and 1500 Horſe, ſat down before <hi>Chielefa,</hi> a Fortreſs of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, tho' tamely delivered by them laſt year to the menaces of the Chriſtians. They now batter it with ſix great Guns, and had lain 10 days before it when the Army of the <hi>Venetians</hi> haſtning to its relief landed at <hi>Porto Vitulo,</hi> not far from it, and ſending a Detachment of 3000 Men, with 2000 Maynotes, the Garriſon which conſiſted of 1200 having orders at the ſame time to ſally in their favour; the Enemy, intimidated with the report of their advance, raiſed the Siege and marched ſilently away in the Night, yet not ſo, but that being purſued by the Chriſtians, they left their Cannon behind them, the 500 men that conducted them being alſo moſt ſlain and taken Priſoners. After this Defeat General <hi>Moroſini</hi> rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked his Forces at <hi>Porto Vitulo,</hi> and ſailed towards the Gulf of <hi>Calamata,</hi> and thence to <hi>Porto Clinno,</hi> where he was to joyn with General <hi>Koningſmark,</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Land Forces, lately arrived there with a great Convoy that went from <hi>Venice.</hi> They had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the arrival of the Auxiliary Gallies to open the Campaign, which being at length come, and a review of the Forces taken by General <hi>Moroſini,</hi> which were eſtimated at 25000 men, they ſailed the 25 of <hi>May</hi> from <hi>Porto Trepana</hi> with a fleet of above 100 ſail, conſiſting in 80 Ships, 14 Galeaſſes, and ſeveral Gallies and Galliots, taking their courſe towards <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto,</hi> feigning a deſign to attack that Fortreſs, near which the General cauſed 1000 men to be landed to allarm the Country, and leaving ſome Ships there to countenance the feint, ſailed the Night following towards <hi>Modon,</hi> then ill manned, the Turks having drawn moſt of their Forces towards <hi>Lepanto.</hi> But the Captain General thought fit to attack old <hi>Navarin,</hi> the <hi>Pylus</hi> of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> firſt, which he did, 12000 foot, and 1500 Horſe being landed for that purpoſe. This Town is built upon a height, at the foot whereof the Haven is capable of any number of Ships. The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of this place was weak, not exceeding 200, ſo that affrighted with the Fleet, the numbers, and the ſummons of the Chriſtians, they immediately ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, capitulating to march out with their Arms and Baggage, which they did, leaving behind them 20 pieces of Braſs Cannon, 23 of Iron, and 7 Mortars, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides 200 Chriſtian ſlaves, who obtained their liberty.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Coningſmark</hi> marched from thence to New <hi>Navarino,</hi> ſeated on a Rock, and of very difficult ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. He circled it by Land as well as the place would permit, whilſt it was beaten from Sea with 20 pieces of Cannon and 18 Mortas. The <hi>Seraskier</hi> of <hi>Morea,</hi> being ſollicitous for this place, advanced with 10000 men for its relief, deſtroying all the Countries as he paſſed. The Chriſtians, to prevent his advance, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a body of men behind them to maintain the Works, marched to meet him, and endeavoured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times to engage him to a Battel, which he avoided by paſſing a River, and retiring to a very advantageous Ground. Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced thereupon to 14000, it was reſolved they ſhould paſs the River in two Places, and charge the Turks in Front and Flank, which was performed accordingly. The Victory was obſtinately conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for at leaſt two hours, but then the Turks being diſordered fled, leaving 1000 of their men ſlain, wounded, and Priſoners, with all their Tents, Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and Baggage. The Chriſtians had ſcarce 100 killed and wounded. Triumphing with this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they returned to the Siege, where, upon a ſecond ſummons, the Beſieged ſeeing their hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour defeated, and their Baſſa ſlain, being blown up,<note place="margin">June <hi>17.</hi> Nava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rino <hi>ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi>
                     </note> with 150 of the Garriſon by a Bomb falling amongſt Powder, they likewiſe being 1200 Foot, and 200 Horſe, ſurrendred upon Conditions to march away with their Arms, Bag, and Baggage, which they did, leaving behind them 64 pieces of Cannon, and thirteen Mortars, with great ſtore of Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>After the taking of <hi>Navarin,</hi> the General reſolved to beſiege <hi>Modon,</hi> tho' he knew the <hi>Seraskier</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced the Garriſon, and provided it with all things neceſſary for a juſt defence, with promiſe of certain Succours by a day. <hi>Modon</hi> is ſeated upon a Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Sea of <hi>Sapienza,</hi> Art and Nature having concurred to make it ſtrong, tho' it held out but a Siege of 13 days. It was indeed miſerably torn with Bombs and Carcaſſes, and the relief not appearing at the day appointed, the Baſſa thought fit to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,<note place="margin">Jul. <hi>7.</hi>
                     </note> and marched out with near 3000 men, which were to be tranſported to <hi>Alexandria.</hi> There were taken in the Caſtle and Town 90 Braſs Guns, 8 Iron ones, with 13 Mortars, and a great quantity of Ammunition and Proviſions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moroſini</hi> having ſtayed ſome time at <hi>Modon,</hi> as well to repair the Fortifications as to refreſh his wearied Troops, having held a great Council of War, it was reſolved to beſiege <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> the better to ſecure the conqueſts which the Republick had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made in <hi>Morea.</hi> All things being made ready for ſo important an Enterpriſe, the Captain Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſailed from <hi>Modon</hi> with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet and the Auxiliary Gallies, and at the ſame time ſent orders to the Captain Extraordinary of the Ships to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach towards that Coaſt with the Squadron un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command, that he may joyn the Fleet if there be occaſion. As a prelude to this enterpriſe, 8 Turkiſh Ships that had carried Men and Proviſions to <hi>Napo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li de Romania,</hi> endeavouring to eſcape by night out of Port <hi>Malvaſia,</hi> were taken.<note place="margin">July <hi>30.</hi>
                     </note> In the mean time the General landed his Army at <hi>Ciara,</hi> ſix miles from <hi>Napoli,</hi> the <hi>Nauplia</hi> of the Antients, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed himſelf the next day of the Hill <hi>Palemada,</hi> within Muſquet ſhot of the Town. The <hi>Seraskier</hi> of <hi>Morea</hi> being encamped not far off with 8 or 10000 men, did put 300 Souldiers into the Town, the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon before conſiſting of 2000 under the Command of <hi>Muſtapha Baſſa,</hi> and advanced himſelf towards the Chriſtians Camp; upon notice whereof, General <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſmark</hi> marched with his Forces to meet him,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>6.</hi>

The Turks ſcarce ſtanding their Ground, retired in much diſorder, leaving 400 of their men behind them. The loſs on the Chriſtians ſide was inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, not exceeding 50 men. General <hi>Koningſmark</hi> returning to the Siege, ſent ſome Troops to force the Caſtle of <hi>Argas</hi> which they found abandoned, and had that of <hi>Tenioni</hi> delivered upon demand. In the mean time the Siege was vigorouſly carried on, the Bombs and Carcaſſes occaſioning great Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Town. But the <hi>Seraskier</hi> being reinforced with 3000 freſh men, raiſed their dejected minds,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:39539:166"/>who at the ſame time that the Seraskier approached the Chriſtian Camp, made a great Sally upon the Beſiegers, though they were beaten back with loſs, and the Seraskier ſo warmly received by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non from the Hill of <hi>Polameda,</hi> that he retired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any attempt upon the Lines. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiegers by this were lodg'd in the Town-Moat, ſo that the Seraskier being reinforced out of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Garriſons to 12000, reſolved to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other attempt to relieve the place, by forcing the Camp. At the ſame time 1500 of their beſt men ſallied out of the City, ſo that the Chriſtians being hardly put to it, the <hi>Slavonians</hi> being overpower'd, were forced to give way, but General <hi>Koningſmark</hi> coming opportunely to their aſſiſtance with a ſtrong Party, rallied them, and beat back the <hi>Turks.</hi> In that inſtant of time, General <hi>Moroſini</hi> having landed 3500 men, charged the Enemy ſo ſeaſonably in Front and Flank, that they diſordered them, and forced them to retire, but they being much ſtronger in Horſe, were not purſued far. The <hi>Turks</hi> loſt in this action 1500 of their beſt men,<note place="margin">Napoli di Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania <hi>ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</hi> Aug. <hi>31</hi>

The Garriſon upon this defeat, upon conſideration of the Mines and Breaches, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſtanding out an Aſſault, ſurrendred upon the ſame terms as had been given to <hi>Navarino</hi> and <hi>Modon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chriſtians loſt a great many Men by a Flux contracted by the heat, and eating too much fruit, and among others, a Nephew of General <hi>Koningſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> the Captain of his Guards, and Count <hi>Bernabo Viſconti</hi> a <hi>Milaneze</hi> Collonel.</p>
                  <p>The Baſſa of <hi>Napoli di Romania,</hi> whether out of a conſciouſneſs of not having done his duty in defence of the City, or out of a reſentment that to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy is to be criminal, thought it ſecurer to put himſelf into the protection of his Vanquiſhers, than to expoſe himſelf to the candor of his Compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at home. He therefore, with about eighty <hi>Turks</hi> more, having obtained leave of the General, were ſhipt for <hi>Venice,</hi> where they were honourably recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Senate,</hi> preſented, and permitted to take two fine Houſes, with very fine Gardens belonging to them, where they and their Families live at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. After the taking of <hi>Napoli,</hi> above ſixty ſmall Towns and Burghs put themſelves under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the <hi>Venetians;</hi> and the General having ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led affairs there, and diſmiſſed the Auxiliary Gallies with their ſhares of the Booty to return home, failed himſelf with the Gallies of <hi>Venice</hi> towards the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelag</hi> to put thoſe Iſlands, which he alſo in a great meaſure did, under contribution. The Garriſon and Inhabitants of <hi>Napoli</hi> being numerous, exceeding 10000, beſides the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> who were made Tributaries, were by Articles to be tranſported to the Iſle of <hi>Tenedos,</hi> which was alſo done in 12 Ships, commanded by Seignior <hi>Venier.</hi> This Fleet did not only alarm thoſe parts, but <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelf, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the report of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Armada ſo near the <hi>Dardanels:</hi> But upon their return they were met, and fought by the Captain Baſſa, who had 20 Gallies and 10 Ships, but ſeeing he could do no good upon them, was obliged to quit the fight. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raskier, in the mean time, was retired to <hi>Corinth,</hi> from whence he ſent ſome Troops to reinforce the Garriſon of <hi>Petraſſa,</hi> and very ſtrong Parties, who by their incurſions, keep the <hi>Greeks</hi> in continual alarms, and hinder them from openly declaring for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</hi> To this end, he hath ſeized upon divers of the Principal of them, keeping them as Hoſtages, but exerciſes all kinds of cruelty againſt ſuch as he ſuſpects to have any correſpondence with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cara Ibrahim,</hi> the late Viſier, being ſtript of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,<note place="margin">Mar. <hi>18.</hi>

                  <p>Nor was the <hi>Venetian</hi> War confined only to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> though nothing extraordinary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the later, that wiſe <hi>Republick</hi> having ſent <hi>Cornaro</hi> to command in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> with ſuch Forces as might endeavour to divert the <hi>Turks</hi> from ſending Succours either to <hi>Hungary</hi> or <hi>Morea,</hi> which they alſo in ſome meaſure did. And yet ſcarce any thing worthy a place in Hiſtory, which is only pleaſed with great events, did intervene, the Forces indeed of neither ſide being ſufficient for great underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings. Some inconſiderable Places were intercepted on both ſides, and the incurſions of Parties into each others Quarters were frequent; wherein the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laques,</hi> like the <hi>Tartars</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Poland,</hi> did ſignalize themſelves. The Baſſa of <hi>Scutari</hi> had drawn together 7 or 8000 Men, with a Reſolution to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack the City of <hi>Budna,</hi> but they were ordered to march towards <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſo that that deſign vaniſhed. But General <hi>Cornaro,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was Lieutenant General of the Foot, having drawn together 1000 Horſe, and 3000 Foot, and 5000 <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laques,</hi> commanded by the Chevalier <hi>Janco,</hi> with the Artillery and Ammunition neceſſary for a Siege, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to attack <hi>Sign,</hi> ſcituated upon a Rock,<note place="margin">Sept. <hi>23.</hi>
                     </note> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with a good Wall and ſtrong Caſtle, but the Cannon opening a Breach, it was aſſaulted and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by force, the Garriſon which conſiſted but of 250 <hi>Turks,</hi> being cut in pieces. By taking of this place, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are become Maſters of the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Province of <hi>Zettina.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Grand Viſier,</hi> upon his repaſſing the Bridge of <hi>Eſſeck,</hi> had ſent home the Troops of <hi>Boſſina,</hi> ſo that the Baſſa of the ſaid Province, thinking himſelf with this reinforcement, in a condition to make ſome attempt upon the Enemy, was accordingly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for it, tho' watched narrowly by <hi>Cornaro.</hi> The Baſſa of <hi>Erzegovina</hi> had likewiſe got a competent Army together, and having burnt ſome Villages, retired towards <hi>Clin,</hi> to put a Convoy of Proviſions into that place, <hi>Cornaro</hi> at the ſame time having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his march towards <hi>Zsbenico</hi> and <hi>Sardona,</hi> to cover thoſe places. And thus this year, and the Campain, were finiſhed, except the uſual excurſions, both here, in <hi>Morea,</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> and in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are always buſie, and infeſt each other accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their power.</p>
                  <p>The deſires of the <hi>Port</hi> for Peace were great. It was againſt their Maxims to wage War with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny powerful Adverſaries at once, nor could they tell how to extricate themſelves out of it. They had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten attempted ſeparate Treaties, but the Allies were not to be disjoyned, they therefore offer'd them Conceſſions they durſt not have hoped for at the beginning of the War. They would yield to the Emperor all <hi>Hungary,</hi> as far as the <hi>Drave,</hi> to the King of <hi>Poland, Caminiec</hi> and all <hi>Podolia,</hi> and reſtore to the <hi>Venetians</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Candia,</hi> on condition they would part with what they had gained in <hi>Morea.</hi>
